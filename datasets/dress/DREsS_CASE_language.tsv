Besides education, computers can also keep us entertained with games such as virtual solitaire. However, public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a new car and for the adventurer who want to have an exciting travel for then to see more action.Like watching outside or sight seeing,to mingle and meet different people.In addition to this I also admire the bullet train in japan which u consider fast and safe public vehicle Ive'd known.

"@CAPS1 judgment comes from expirience, and expirience comes from bad judgement, qouted from my uncle's dad. Often the evolution is return of origins however I hope that the man in the next years will be to don't forget the past. Therefore, the public also lacks @CAPS1 judgement in using computers and the detrimental effects are starting to show. the public transport  have no future , the crisis in 2008 ; has been down the oil prices .The oil is cheap now and new cars are more efficient and the goverment give stimolous for consumers. To begin with, computers can be a @CAPS2 issue for people. Michael decided to open the door and back for her, he thought better the things he do not want to leave her again, he like her, he knows himself and he wants to know her, he have kept all his feelings for a long time. Because of bad @CAPS2 effects the screen has on your eyes. Furthermore, computer games are made to be addicting, which causes @CAPS3 to sit in front of the computer instead of excercising. This @MONTH1 be one of the biggest causes of obesity in @LOCATION2! Everybody thinking like the public transport is not comfort for us, but environmentally the public transport is suitable to decrease the pollution and our energy sources also decrease. Three words that describe me really good is: happy funny and sometimes bothersome A thing that i would like that people knew is that its not a good idea that wake me when im sleeping. In our earth, Hunderds of millions prople living in here.Except us, There are also a large number of wildlife. In those days almost 80% of people have assured feel preocupation about their bodies and their alimentation, for this they convidenced me that they will try improve their habitual alimentation everyday and their will do sport more frequently. First, computers need electricity to run. When freddy begin to sings the kids screams and they sing with Freddy the famous Freddy Fazbear´s Song,Bonny plays the battery and Chica serves the pizza to the children, This year the stablishment close because they found the body of a dead child. Over @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's powerplants are coal, petroleum, or natural gas based. When people turn on the computer because they are bored, it wastes electricity that doesn't need to be used. I used all of the things except two.I didn't have the Internet when I was child.And also we couldn't choose  programmes.I played in the street and walked to school alone.I'm thinking what kind if things were more dangerous for me?It was so dangerous when my friends and I swam in the Tobol river.We jumped into the water and caught crayfish.When I remember that moment I am exciting.I guess everychild want to investigate the world.We have to help them,to show and explain.What kind of risks they can get if to do that. Mohammed is a kindly prophet born in small city called mekka and travelled to another city closed to mekka called almadina cause the people of mekka were very aggressive and they not accepted the new Invitation for the new religio Mohammed came back to his town mekka after that and forgave the people of mekka whose abused him In other words there is a definite connection between computers and global warming. What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player ,i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families, It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs.In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us.In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable. Frist of all at home we recycle plastics, glasses, papers and cartons, oils, clothes, batteries, organics in an especial composting bank where we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials and finally all the other things are sends to an especial tip where we avoid to drop it anywhere. There is a definite connection between the two as most people just put something in the microwave to eat to be able to go back to the computers as fast as possible. In my opinion, Family is the place that had you best friend can help each other and know each.In the Taiwan,many of people have to take care of them parent when they get old,but the point is what if you can not survival,I mean you don't have enough money to raise you parent.Back to the topic,I don't know well any of member of in my family,I don't trust them,honestly. public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it is kind of becoming cheaper and also more safe but some  people prefer cars to extent do we agree with and what is our reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay  before about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was not even good facility to move from place to other and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans at the beginning the faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve it by the end nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and planes .some people prefer cars because the do like crowded places or because the find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places  to summaries it is different from some oneis opinion to another i predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end cars will disappear and will will no longer be used The only way to cook would be with fire. many countries are truly started to concern no environment and worried about the globe warming ,In schools teachers are doing their best  to educate children how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy,also they train them how to plant trees in public gardens of their towns ,Although  government strict so many laws and taxes in the people how do not pay their taxes to the council for cleaning of the rubbish from towns and villages,in the biggest polluted city in the world people started to use bicycles and cycling instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city,also they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive. Furthermore, how would @CAPS3 be able to even start a fire without @CAPS4 how to light a match? Evidently excessive computer use could have very detrimental effects in a natural disaster, even to adults, so we need to stop it! Secondly, if you use the car, you haven't wait much time ti catch the bus or the train, and maybe you can arrive later at your job, for this situation. But we don't have forgotten the cotamination by cars, We can use more the bicycle or public transportetion. How will we handle a major natural disaster? In conclusion, people are spending too much time on their computers, and they need to stop! People are becoming @CAPS6, @CAPS7 the environment, and losing important life skills. In all over the world people always need advices to keep looking after their environments .First ,the municipal should do workshops in schools and universities providing students by tips that should help us to make our environment clean .Second ,they should make awareness campaigns about environment ;for example , telling people to put their rubbish in waste papre basket which helping workers to recycling it easily .Finally ,to stay healthy we need a healthy environment ."	1

In my opinion, Family is the place that had you best friend can help each other and know each.In the Taiwan,many of people have to take care of them parent when they get old,but the point is what if you can not survival,I mean you don't have enough money to raise you parent.Back to the topic,I don't know well any of member of in my family,I don't trust them,honestly. And if students are living alone, much money is needed. So by doing a part-time job, they can help their family. no of all people could afford to make conveyenc by car .car is easy and cozy also but public transprt is fair is much affordable to all clasess of poeple public transport means mainly pubic bus.people used to travell long disistance by publis bus .it is possible to carry large number of people of different places to carry in bus. For example they can travel or study abroad. Maintaing cars are expensive.Public transport you do not need to worry about any petrol filling, checking tyre pressures, getting tired after driving long journey.In future cutting down public transport affects many of the people.Elderly people wont able to drive always depends on public transport.If public transport stop services people who are not able to drive will  affect a lot. Secondly, do more cooperation between countries.To illustrate, people should cooperation To intervene to bring peace to the world to stop the war in many areas like what United Nations doing.For example, United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy . I don't think there is no future for public transport.Especially in urban, for example, Taipei city in Taiwan.People who lives there almost know the convenient public transport called MRT, it's fast, cheaper and doesn't have to find the parking lot. I start this sport since I was 10 years old.where my father was playing this sport also,but he started it when he was more greater than me,He was about 30 years old.where squash is one of the games that can be played in any age,I love this game because I find it making exercise to all the body in the same time , we are running in small place moving hands in stretched and different ways in the same time you are working your mind in the same time so it need caring and quik thinkink, as much exercise you will find down the road . Moreover they can learn how hard working is. The other matter is about our habit to eating food together with our family that were a custom in humanity life not just in our culture,but now because of hard and busy life ,we had to eat our meal  mostly days of a week. Therefore I think that it is important for college student to have a part-time job."	1
8	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"  The intriguing topic at hand is whether smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends. Nowadays we use technology in every thing, from educations to making clothes, we use technology everyday and everywhere.Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful,useful and  important for development but todays generation is influenced whit technology that they have stopped to do other activities. Some people claim that using smartphones disturb communication among family and friends. I suggested to other people  first to understand yourself such as  what do you like, which is possible and than practice after every success However, I claim that smartphones haven't destroyed communication among family and friends for the following three reasons. More environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of themthere is to that we have a center of care and, other more institutions, we also make environmental protection centers were people can visit and learn about this to sum up our village is very concentrated on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us Firstly, staff and Personnel design the background colour , the artwork and the scuriity issues on the bank notes,which is also  done in process of other card,such as notes for supermarket.Then in the preparation process, skilled machinists prepare of metal plates for printing.After that sheets of bank notes are printed,there are differences and specials for it, it use special ink ,and print colors on both side,images are slightly rised. If you ask someone about the future, answers will be different but all will be around two main topics, Those last are either optimist future or pessimist one. In the end, large colleges admit largest number of students, so the student may do establishing friendships more from different nationalities, also it serves the community by graduating many students in various majors. After preparing of metal plates by skilled machinists,it takes sheets of bank .There are three requirements fot it:colour on both sides,special ink and images slighty raised. Second, smartphones increase the frequency of communicating with family and friends. Nowadays, the transportation become more prefect,and the people'life become more convenient.Althought this change lend the life of people efficient,the problem should not be ignored.It would really be helpful if the government make tighter resrictions,in today's world ,lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission, they are destroyed the forest,farmland and wetland,charging waster water and emitting greenhouse gas,it lead to a serious enviorment problem.So the government should oversee this companies ,and if companies do not obey the rules or laws ,it will be fined and closed. First of all, thank you professor to teach in the meantime, the entire course of the learn really benefited, especially in the first meeting, for British English, I still did not really understand, it makes me frustrated, but gradually after I found the beautiful of the language in British English, I think it’s all because of the usual problem of American English, and so I really appreciate that you choose simple  textbooks and it’s easy to learn, and you really very carefully and very humorous, you're always careful in curriculum pronunciation correction for each student, using a variety of reading skills let us immerse them read. But now we can easily communicate by using smartphones. In conclusin,the whole part of process is an unreversed schedule.It cosumemed the power which contained the humanity and machinic.Nevertheless,in my opinion the most precious of the revolution is the modern security measure through such a muti-developed society. So we can easily communicate through smartphones. Dear all I Am communicating to you, with the purpose of let yo know that we will set up a meeting at  my office with the purpose of discuss how we  could use social media to improve the Communication with our suplliers, i think a great time for the meeting could be next Monday at 4:00 p.m Kind regards Armando Martínez Finally, we can regulate using smartphones. The social networks such as: Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,Google plus... are connecting  us to more and more friends, companies, public figures, books, films, social organizations...we are really have many things to see, to think, to ""like"", to ""comment"" and a dozen of stuffs that we can make an action to interactive with others...so may it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves, to take care our healthy. Smartphones don't force us to stop communication. Communication in real world is only up to us. Using smartphones give us more topics to talk, smartphones haven't destroyed communication among family and friends. To summarize, smartphones are the things that make us more communicate with our family and friends. Smartphones give interesting topics to talk. Also smartphones make us communicate more with our family. Suddenly we heard the sound of running footsteps.Then there was a cry and the footsteps stopped.Nervously,we walked back.Perhaps someone had been killed,or kidnapped in the street We were going to see what happened ,and we had something to see.There was one old granny who was beat up.We try to gave her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that.Than we were trying to find help ,but nobody was opening doors.On our luck I had a mobile phone ,but Michael was saying that we need to escape because we did not know are those bullies near the corner.My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I've done that. However the best option is that you came here and after I present my friends and their fathers because they can help with your job. This sport cause fresh and jolly me and I think will exercise cause healthy.if you start volleyball, you need a ball and piece of ground that separate with tie."	1
9	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"But today, Things are getting change and technology marked a significant role in our life, Automobile segment increased its vertical and having a car becomes a need from luxory. What could cause this phenominon. My town do much efforts to care of environment,they put many pins in the streets to keep it clean also they prevent private drivinig at many days to keep air clean ,they seed trees to absorb co2 and release o2 ,they build factories away from the house of population to prevent respiratory diseases which is a result of air pollution from factories,so not only my country it self but also the individuals follow a proper way to keep environment clean. So,my favourite sport in the present time it is street workout.I have been exercising this sport already long time.I like to exercise on the street even in the season when the temperature outside below zero.Of course, in summer I like to exercise more than in winter but this don't stop me.I don't know myself why,but I almost every day go on the street in order to exercise.If  It is very coldly and windily outside,I don't worry about it and I'm exsercising at home.For those people, who want to start to exercise the street workout I'm advising to start with basic exerscises such as pull ups,push ups,dips and squats.That everything basic exercises and they will help you will do a good start up.After some time when you will be feeling that you are ready for more, you can start to study more difficult exercises. Volleyball its my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I were in another world, in which I can be free and happy, apart of this, when I am bad, this is a distration of the university. Nevertheless the journalists stay all the time having a photo,all the time,when they eaten, drinking, happy, sad,how is your love life and with whoever stay, if stay with something important our what buy. Well, for starters they help slow the waste of paper. Did you know that the @LOCATION1 kills aproximately @NUM1 million trees a year for book. I suggested to other people  first to understand yourself such as  what do you like, which is possible and than practice after every success For example instead of sending a short letter to the police cheif asking about what the new driving law is. You could send an email and save the paper. my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long. After two years that his essay was released, he will understand that his essay was wrong moreover, Michael will want to apologise many people who read his essay thereby Michael now goes home, takes a cup of tea, goes to bed thus Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake To sum up, do sports is very important for teenagers to which the body is going to grow and do it regularly is commitment that we should take. This perspective of life is inspired by contracultural movements and some people call to these people as “alternative”, but it is each day more common and it let a inclusive and diverse society. So say that I want to know how many legs a centiped has (parents don't know either) without a computer it would take @NUM5 min to get to the library, @NUM6 min to find a parking spot, and @NUM4 min to find a book about cenipeeds. In total thats a least @NUM8 mins but my computer would only take @NUM1 min @NUM10 sec about. Also if you wanted to ask a friend what she is doing on @DATE1. I screamed, my anger had dominated my mind i didnt had no longer control over my actions, i was afarid of what i had become and what i could do, but i could not control my self and the only thing i could think of was him suffering with a slow death and the satisaction i would feel when i finally had my revange, the best revange. My third reason was because computer are loaded with information, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 library I might find @NUM4 book on a sudject but on a computer I @MONTH1 find thousand. Once I was doing a report on monarch butterflys. @CAPS2 the @CAPS3 library I found @NUM12 books about them, On the internet I found @NUM13 wedsites on them! Also books have general information like just @CAPS5 life, but the internet has specific information the @CAPS5 part in the enviorment. Invention of car has made people's lives easier.No more they have to solely depend on public transport.Though public transport are cheaper and one could get to know many companions ,increase network.But public transport has fixed schedule and on a rushing day not many can really enjoy their journey."	1

Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with?

First of all, the earth is a restricted planet. Fdi can play important role in it.It give competition to national companies .By virtue of which they  work properly mannerly and give better option to policy holders.people can always buy nominal premium we should aware them about the types of insurance as well as benefits of the insurancce. MOTASSEM is nice and lovely fiance he love his job as he is Patient will dong has jop .he is  a  hard worker he has amazing laughs     .When you started  talk with him you will be inspire by his knowledge and his way of talk he have the talent to Convinces  thought. i love my family special my little sister, she has sixteen years old, i consider my best friend because i used to tell her everything of my life. my favorite sport is swimming i swim 2 times per a week sometimes i go to the swimming pool in the same area which i work there and sometimes i go to the swimming pool of my cousin, i enjoy when i spend my time in the water and now even i am pregnant i am afraid when i swim with a group of people i keep telling them and screaming do not close with me ! For example, the planetarium in a navigate room for learnt about the position of star, four small boats use for practiced the leadership and navigation in Pontevedra  river, or even the simulation for maked the situations which are seldom happen. The next reason is the historical fact that humans had developed so far doing researches. They are called below: 1- chaharshanbeh soori 2- Norouz 3- sizdehbedar  chahrshanbeh soori:  It meaning Tuesday night of week and take place on last Tuesday night of the year .at this night people make a bonfire and jump over the fires and say to fire :I give you my sign of sickness(yellow color)and you give me your healthy sign (red color)and eat some special foods . no of all people could afford to make conveyenc by car .car is easy and cozy also but public transprt is fair is much affordable to all clasess of poeple public transport means mainly pubic bus.people used to travell long disistance by publis bus .it is possible to carry large number of people of different places to carry in bus. However, the invention of the car changed the world. If people hesitate to invest in a larger area, it will be the end of human development history. Even if it is scary to invest money in a mystery place, it will return more than invested money. A number of people think that investing money in outer space is useless. This is terrible, you do not have privacy authought the society have a blame, because if they do not take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored. There are too many things that made life better since there was an investment in outer space. In addition, my major is English so teachers will teach and explain by English, which I can’t catch up on lessons well in the first time. It might seem like investing billion dollars to rockets are insane. However, if there was no investment in a rocket, there will be no GPS and navigation that made a number of things possible including saving people with location tracking. In conclusion, there are obvious reasons why governments should invest in outer space: limited resources, to develop, and application. People have to see further to make humans great. We were all excited, those from Lala Band minunate.Their voices have positive vibration through their musical and give you a good feeling.On the scene moves very well and know how to take pleasure to the public.I am feeling wonderful and my promise is that when going to have a special occasion to go to a concert supported by Lala Band, you will be with me.As like this in all my heart.I hope as those recounted by me in this mail and you feel a slight vibration from the concert."	1
11	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Nowadays, public transport is used for many people in the cities, we can find different types of them, such as bus tube and train, but is there a future for it or not?, I am going to respond this question giving disadvantanges and advantages and  finally I give my personal opinion. Hi,I am Amy.I would like to spend two months studying in English,two months doing volunteering in children charity and the least two months travelling in UK.What do you think of my plan?I will not only improve my English skills but also devote myself to get along with children.The most important of all,I will take an adventure to the unknown place in UK.I am looking forward to seeing you soon.I would like to invite you to join the road trip with me.it must be an amazing experience if we are together for this trip.As long as you can go with me just let me know. In this view, I consider, though, there is lots of sports on Televison, they are not too much, because the people have looke for it. KAIST students tend to talk about something after they know about it well enough to show others. he said kindly:""I buy you a present,open it,Tom"" Tom opened the big bag,Oh!This is a big surprise,there was a football in it,which he always wanted to buy there were some words goal!keep doing! However, I think it would be better that they have some confidence even when they talk about somthing they are not used to. First, We can hear many thoughts than before. If only someone who has perfect knowledge and flawless opinion can give a talk about something, we can only hear from few people. That was me, I never liked studying, I never found myself in those subjects, but it wasn't the big deal to me, I hated is being seen as unsuccessful or a loser, as I wasn't that, I knew that I'm clever enough to study all these subjects and do well in exams so I can get high marks but they're all didn't get that, they judged me for my marks but marks don't form brains or thoughts, marks isn't the only way that makes you great now and then in the future. I reduce use of innecesary power at home, in other words,I turn on light that I need for the while i use it;I take less warm shower; I hit only neccesary rooms.

Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe, in fact there is some important tournament where participate all important Europe team,They are called ""Champions League"" and ""Europa League"".football is a team sport in fact in this sport participate everyboby without exclude nobody. I think improvement goes faster when the person has many experiences in the part. And the best way to do is just doing it. after that the celebration was began and a lot of their friends have attended each one presented a gift for Sara , she was very delighted and suddenly the doorbell been rang  she was her old friend Tia . They were talking about their lives and  he remembered like he knew her on the bus, maybe  she have always been the woman of his live he looked at eyes and smile he wants to ask her whether now is not late to satart to know her but he decided leave the pub he walked to exit. Third, expressing something without any confidence is very important in knowing myself. Our mind is not deterministic. It is not discrete. it's for this reason that I think the public transport is a great benefit for the society, and a good way for move us of the one place at other,  I suggest that  the government  has to give more means for the purpose of improving the public transport. But, trying to show their thoughts is very important to establish their emotion and thoughts. It was a cold day at night when I was at home watching my favourite programme on my telly called ""dare to win"", I was with my brother, when we decided to call, The programme is about questions for the contestants that must be answer in correct time, and there is a different things for the winner. as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! Today, how about reviewing your attitude? I want you to have such attitude."	1

"In these diagrams below,the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly.The first step,the bank notes should be desinged concidering some constructions,like background color,artwork and security issues,After it was prepared,skilled machinists would make preparaation of metal plates in the second step.Then,sheets of bank notes would be printed by 50 bank notes per sheet,which have colour imagines on both sides in special ink.After printing well,these sheets would be manually inspected closely.It was the most important step during the whole processing.And then,some  sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets  which would be cut into and separated into equal ones andpacked and depatched to where they are demanded. This process involves five main stages.First,it should take some considerations in design,including background colour,artwork,security issues.Next,skilled machinists is prepared ,in which there are metal plates.Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet).Subsequently, the technical must be used specially for distinction,for example the colour printed on both sides,Special ink is used and imges slightly raised.After this,printed sheets will be inspected carefully.According to the quality of sheets,it will be two results.if the quality is good or the bank notes is partially damaged which can be used,it would cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and disoatched.while those bad sheets will be securely destroyed. Most of the labours will probably have been represented by machinery, the people who is lack of academic might be very hard to get a job, the knowledge might be demand if the people live in the future. I know not spending time exercising is bad but learning about new things cant be that bad. for example, lunch time travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emission of carbon mono oxide which is effected to red blood cells and irritate to breathing system. We use computers in life. Computers are good for people who use them to learn about the world. public transport is very crowded so you may not have a seat .I hate public transport as I was attacked by mad man once .also taxi is  not a good transport .I wish I have my own car soon to get rid of public transport . Or even people who can't talk use computers to talk for them. The @ORGANIZATION2 uses computers to save lives. Computers save lifes in so many ways its scary to think if they were all gone we could all start dying. One day I visit my friend Jimmy in New York city, he was a young man who was specialist on trains and tourism, he talked about how the citizens and the commuters move from one place to another, he told me that the grand central terminal was the largest terminal of the city,he show me were the landmarks of the big apple were so sightseers could go,he show me the city and we went to different parts first he took me to Columbus circle in the south west corner of central park were there were the most expensive apartments then we went to the lake were the jogging tracks that circle the lake area popular with early morning visitors,then we went to the museum of natural history that was located near the metropolitan museum of art then I got focal on the subway trains so we went to Grand central terminal when we arrive I was amazed to see many people going to work so he told me that it was conveniently for people to use the train because is very fastest and for the government it was a grat economic business then he told me that one of the characteristics of Lets say someone has what looks like a normal fever and you just say thats what they have. There is not so much traffic, and my senses and lounges perceive and respire all the smell that flowers,  land, the First, I walk slowly and then I begin to walk as soon as possible to improve my fitness and I end walking 5 turns in the park.

We even use computers in libraries why the library. for example,using wind Energy or Solar Energy for electricity generation we will be used less fuel what is affected in emissions. I don’t like Narnia, but my favorite movie is probably 22 jump street, Lord of the rings, The tv-show: suits, The walking dead and maybe south park and family guy.

I want to turn to his hobbies, when he isn't working, he is riding on a bike, every evening he takes the bike and rides across some paths for more than forty kilometers by day, so he is very good rider and its quite strong to ride with him. In addition, my major is English so teachers will teach and explain by English, which I can’t catch up on lessons well in the first time. Kids even use computers for school and school work. So many people rely on technology to get through there life.

To begin with,the format of the bank notes needs to be designed,factors of considerations including the background colour,the artwork and the security issues.Sencondly,equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps.Thirdly,print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink,where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes. we can see that there are lots of serious and frequently weather disaster happened in decades, such as typhoon, hurricane, wild fire and mud slide."	1

Computers help people learn about foreign places. Before my uncle went to @LOCATION4, he wanted to learn about their culture. I love to listen to British English, but it’s really hard to study, all because we are all learning American English in Taiwan, so when I have the opportunity to contact British English, it’s full of tone cadence, always feel particularly charming, and British culture exudes noble temperament, so British accent sounds like there is always an indescribable elegance qualities. How would you feel if you went another country and knew nothing about it? The service is very bad the drivers are very angry and stressed out these do not lead with cauition, in Toluca exist report of high rates of accidents by buses.

In this view, I consider, though, there is lots of sports on Televison, they are not too much, because the people have looke for it. The film is a romantic movie, It is talking about one man, Noa, who lives in a small shore town when he felt in love with a rich girl, but like always the girl´s parents did not like Noa´s life because the girl´s father thinks that Noa is not enough good for their daughter. But then, I got a @CAPS3 and found her on there. I was very estatic. We swapped numbers and addresses. I do currently master but I can devote myself to the Fellowship Especially since I finished the Pre-Masters and now I need only follow-up from time to time with my guide Academic, so I have the time for the Fellowship . Also, the only way I talk to my aunty, who lives in @LOCATION3, is by the computer. I can't talk to her on the phone because that would run my phone bill up. If the  print sheets has good quality ,they will packing and distribution.some partially damaged  will cut into separate or packede or dispatched .The bad sheets will disposal ,the destroyed will be secure. Also in the sort way, we should go walking to the destination.icle If we are working with  sameone in the same jobs, and  who lives near or he is our neighbour, we can go to the work in the same car, this way we use less oil. Besides, it’s also an environment problem, exhaust fumes engulfed the earth, more car is used, more exhaust gas release, we are killing our mother. In the end,if it is a good sheet,the porcedure is packaging and distribution,including cutting into separate bank notes,packing,dispatching.If it is a bad sheet,the porcedure is disposal    --bad sheetsand bank notes should be securely destroyed. For example, the planetarium in a navigate room for learnt about the position of star, four small boats use for practiced the leadership and navigation in Pontevedra  river, or even the simulation for maked the situations which are seldom happen. Computers are essential to these people. Also, it helps them keep track of their company if they go on a vacation. Let me explain my reasons, when you drive your car you can take it from your garage or in the main door of your house and it gets you whatever you want, but on the other hand if you take public transport it will be much more uncomfortable because you must catch the bus in the bus stop... where is your nearest bus stop? We have a lot of shopping facilities, it is the good thing about living in a big city like Madrid, because we have a lot of different shops since clothes shops, pets shops, food shops, shoes shops, accessories shops, toys shops, presents shops and much more types of shops that know I can not remember, but you can find almost all you want or you need it is not incredible?"	1

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"I don´t have friends who like swimming, almost like football or similar teams sports, and always I go alone it isn´t boring for me furthermore, I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I haven´t wait anybody. She uses her cell phone to set an alarm. A few years ago, my mom would come in and tell us it was time to get up. my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long. One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance,  homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society. Now we can play games, go on the. These advances in the technology are making us very selfish. I, for one, do not approve. First of all, thank you professor to teach in the meantime, the entire course of the learn really benefited, especially in the first meeting, for British English, I still did not really understand, it makes me frustrated, but gradually after I found the beautiful of the language in British English, I think it’s all because of the usual problem of American English, and so I really appreciate that you choose simple  textbooks and it’s easy to learn, and you really very carefully and very humorous, you're always careful in curriculum pronunciation correction for each student, using a variety of reading skills let us immerse them read. To combat the distriction of enviornment,this is a serious problem throughout the world.Nowadays ,many trees and grasses are damaged in many countries,lots of building are constricated.And people should pay attention to this problem and try to slove it. It was a cold day at night when I was at home watching my favourite programme on my telly called ""dare to win"", I was with my brother, when we decided to call, The programme is about questions for the contestants that must be answer in correct time, and there is a different things for the winner. First, Basketball is team sport when it means i need to understand expression of  members  of team and keep contact them  for example  my roll is cutter but i need to do assister, blocker and guarding when i play. the most family member I love and think she is the best friend of mine , my sister , she is elder me about 12 years , I can tell her any thing about my life , my self , my feelings ,hhh also i think if i felt in love she would be the first to know that . But we don't have forgotten the cotamination by cars, We can use more the bicycle or public transportetion. The more time we spend using these items, the more we oppose the idea of being active? You can clearly see how we are growing less energetic, and much more careless of our time. In the reconquest age the stronghold never downfall with a direct assault, finally the Castellan's army after a large siege force to the government surrender it. Frist of all at home we recycle plastics, glasses, papers and cartons, oils, clothes, batteries, organics in an especial composting bank where we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials and finally all the other things are sends to an especial tip where we avoid to drop it anywhere. This afirmation: travelling by car is so much more convenient say everything, for example if we think a lot of time we spent on wait bus to arrive our destiny, the traffic is a lot of things that everyone prefer  buy car it more practical and fast. The service is very bad the drivers are very angry and stressed out these do not lead with cauition, in Toluca exist report of high rates of accidents by buses. The police took a long time to find her after she had been kidnapped, because the person who kidnapped her hid the evidence by a chain of blackmails. Do you see how important it is to spend less time on these silly computers? It sucks us into a virtual world that is sometimes 'bloody' or 'war-like? I like going to the cinema, get out with my friends,  to playing the counter strike, walking to the park, going the shopping and can't stand watching the blood. In conclusion, for me it is a lie that the public transportation has no future, however, they have to make improvements to this like the use of better ways of fuel or energy, one way is using renovable sources of energy such as solar, haeolic (wind) or hidraulic(water),Also there are biodisel, and gasoline extracted from seaweed.And the public transportation will be more important in a few years than now. However, they have some disadvantages with a public transport, they gave many traffic jam, this is because the bus a large and difficult to control . I hope you take my advice, and i thank you for your extremely valuable time and effort."	1
15	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"As we know public transportation has not a direct way to fulfill our all destinations then it force us to stop in many stations first, moreover we should take the other one to reach our destination so it is already obvious why using a car is better. Michael went into the teacher office,but he found that his teacher isn't here,maybe teacher went to the bathroom,suddenly,the door is opened by teacher,a teacher who wore bikini came into sight,this incident came as quite a surprise to Michael,she flirted with Michael,Michael felt excited but run out of the office,but he had regret for his action,Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. There are a few people are using puplic transport, like students and someone had low income.in my veiw, i can say might be the puplictransport going to e close because nobody is going to beclose In my case, I was confused when I first used KLMS; and I think other people thought in the same way as I did. The island was flood but the island had a levee that prevent a flooding then in many year a engineers star constructing a building to had more money then in the city put many advertising in all thing : ball, balloon, movies ,etc. And I could find some advantages of online-courses. There are 3 advantages that made me feel online courses are better than offline courses. It is true that we are a lot of users that want to use the car but, and that amount is  growing up; as well there are a lot of people that don't have the posibility to have a car and some use the public transportation because many reasons like the price, because it is easier to get to the place by public transportation rather than car, because the traffic, some times for people it is so exhausting to drive lots of hours an even some times the public transportation is faster. In offline classes, after the class ends, students had to move on to different classroom to have another course. Then the engineers call to other sector to ensure the doubt of Atlantis then the professional say that other was correct. I believe that the people in a future they will begin to travelling shared car more time and they use less the public transport as the train, the bus, underground, etc. My name is shousheng and live in Montreal Canada.Alrough Canada is an English country however in Montreal, the offical language is Freach. I used my car every day however few a few I started to take public transport for I can to save up money This saves a lot of time, and students can do other productive activities like reviewing the lecture, or taking some rest, or going to the restroom. for example,using wind Energy or Solar Energy for electricity generation we will be used less fuel what is affected in emissions. Fifty minutes passed ,when my body no longer was sore.I decided to walk to the end.Constantly,I just walked like without terminal contest.While I strugged to walk.Finally,I saw a light to appeare my eyes and I woke up. In my case, I feel comfortable at home rather than the classroom of college, and this helps me concentrate only on lectures. I notice that in supermarkets are using so much plastic just to cover a small thing or are using many plastic bags without even think how vulnerable is for the environment. Third, it can help professors improve there lectures. I believe that the people in a future they will begin to travelling shared car more time and they use less the public transport as the train, the bus, underground, etc. However, not they can use pre-recorded lecture videos through online classes. I think pre-recorded videos can have better fluency in lecture than the offline-class. The story tell us the story of Monica(Scarlett Johansson) and her routine living in ""Cretacro"" an enormous mysterious island located in the Pacific Ocean,the problem starts when Monica fell in love with Martin. Thus, the above things are the advantages of taking online courses that I thought, and I think online-lecture is a good system."	1

"sukh was so angry with him because he heart her a lot, sukh refuse to give her laptop and her brother start again fighting with her and even he slapped her sister. A nice sunny day, sitting outside under a tree and reading one of your favorite books. Feeling the wind in your hair and taking in all that is going on in the story. You not only read at home but at school as well. As long as i try to keep doing thing on a ecofriendly way i realize that i am give a little from my side and i feel careful of my environment. one day Micheal wanted to go out from his home so he called his besfriend an suggested to go out togther , his friend agreed , so Michael weared his closes , wnet out and closed the door but at this moment he knew he had made a mistake . when am in the court other side participants are fear take off my service ball and am very at my position to cover the entire court. the actions of this film took place in Alexandrie city of Egypt and it talks about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they didn't have much money to produce their own albums , that sort of bands is   famous between the youth and they call it ""under ground bands "" .their songs give a big concenet to the political and social stituation in Egypt and they become famous after the25 january revoulation , why I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society , there is no chance for the youth and if they found it , they face lot of problems to save it and they didn't find time for other activties and in sometimes they worked in thing which  they never learn or love FILM: LUCY (2014) TThe plot of this film is about a 25 naive woman that was living and studying in Taiwan and one night went out for clubbing and met a nutter guy that involved her in a seedy drug smuggling issue with a Corean criminal band that forced her to be a mule drug. Not many teens are able to just be alone and read a good book, which is why I was so shocked when i heard about this strange news. we all know that do sport is very important to keep our life healthy and happy.My favourite sport actually is walking;and I prefer walking in the morning and before sundown.I like also walking in public street,gardens,clubs and on the shore.when i want to go anywhere;I do my best to go on foot.I like this sport since my childhood because I found that I can think about my good time when I was child and relax with myself to think carefully about my present and future.The walking can also fitness and do the knee stronger.It would be interesting to accompain your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time.I advice my guys who suffer from laziness and overweight,try to walk one hour at least and after that they will like this sport. As I told you before because of the technology many things has become able in less time, and with the pass of the years this tend to increase. Kids should be able to read what they want to read. My favourit sport is football i love it so much when i was young i used to watch football and my favorite team is Barcelona i was play with my friends at the street and we was happy with that so much and after that we played at playground like really football i love Cristiano Ronaldo so much he is the best player at the world a few people telling me that messi is the best player but i feel angry when i hear that because that is not true so i looking forward to meet my best player one day its like a dream to me . Some enjoy things that others @MONTH1 not. In these diagrams below,the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly.The first step,the bank notes should be desinged concidering some constructions,like background color,artwork and security issues,After it was prepared,skilled machinists would make preparaation of metal plates in the second step.Then,sheets of bank notes would be printed by 50 bank notes per sheet,which have colour imagines on both sides in special ink.After printing well,these sheets would be manually inspected closely.It was the most important step during the whole processing.And then,some  sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets  which would be cut into and separated into equal ones andpacked and depatched to where they are demanded. I have to start saying that I never imagine swimming like my favorite sport, because until my back´s injury, I practiced other sports, I most like extreme sports like downhill, skateboarding martial arts like Aikido, jiujitsu or ninjutsu, but for my injury I have to start swimming and now I love it. Not all kids like to read romantic or action books. I enjoy reading romantic and mystery novel. Its  popularity spreads all over world too.There are many reasons behind it to be popular.Everyone is able to enjoy the excitement throughout of this game the session.The people who eager to play football must follow some basic rules which are described below: 1.A football player should be punctual and hard-working. @CAPS1 has a lot of fighing in it. In addition, stress is a clear disadvantage of compete because competitiors are trying to win and this can frustrates.But, some people do not think this like this and take it more simply Finally, I think that to compete in sports has some benefits and disadvantages, but when is controlated there are some benefits that help you to whole you life. when i ran with the ball, i feel that i hold a goal or a valuable something and i should offer my best to put it in his place and make it in right way  . Some parents do not want their children reading about vampires and werewolves. To start with,there are a wide range of troublesome it maybe leadding to this phenomeon.Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the persent day cities are already packed with places of residence,commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce.Additionally, people now continues destroyed more agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their need,which will distory the ecosystem  diversity and biodiversity especially the endangered species. I do not think so. the actions of this film took place in Alexandrie city of Egypt and it talks about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they didn't have much money to produce their own albums , that sort of bands is   famous between the youth and they call it ""under ground bands "" .their songs give a big concenet to the political and social stituation in Egypt and they become famous after the25 january revoulation , why I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society , there is no chance for the youth and if they found it , they face lot of problems to save it and they didn't find time for other activties and in sometimes they worked in thing which  they never learn or love So my idea is aii the coutries allthe people stop to use farmland,forest andwetlang to build houses grow more trees portect our world,our homestar! Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath...deep one and started to dive . MEASURES IN FAVOUR OF TAKING CARE THE ENVIRONMENT The council is carrying out a project in order to erradicate the rubbish in my town.This project is focused on separating the rubbish in each green points of the city and also they have to maintain their neighbourhood as clear as are possible. If I brought over @ORGANIZATION1 and read it to their kids and they got offended, should we get rid of @ORGANIZATION1? The answer is no. Some families have a tradition. I have played this sport for twelve years ago this sport has taught me to respect the other not assault to him.there is the only reason that makes me choose this sport is I don't want to be weak I wouldn't like to be nothing in this country that has a rule Strong dominated the weak.when I put my feet in the gym i forget everything shcool,home...therefore I enjoy it.I can't imagine my life without taekwondo it is my blood,my soul.taekwondo it is not a violent sport as many people say but what you have to know is what in the brain and the heart of players.I just get the 1st degree international black belt and I would like to tell to anyone he just starting this sport use your abilities and skills for the right things. So the final question is, should certain materials be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Fdi can play important role in it.It give competition to national companies .By virtue of which they  work properly mannerly and give better option to policy holders.people can always buy nominal premium we should aware them about the types of insurance as well as benefits of the insurancce. I guess it all depends on your view of the situation. Cricket has become a part of me since when I was a kid.Its very interesting sport.Cricket brings a passion on me whenever and wherever its possible I find out a way to start the game.I also watch cricket patiently.Its known as the gentleman's game.The best part of this game is batting whether someone knows or not he first prefer to bat.Batting has its own cherish.So, I also prefer to bat and hitting hard rather than bowling."	1
17	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"we can see that there are lots of serious and frequently weather disaster happened in decades, such as typhoon, hurricane, wild fire and mud slide. As Automotive Industries are huge in market, most of the  house holders  prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time . It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swimming and also when the age become older it will be more difficult to learn than the little . However, I think it will be great if freshman can learn basic essential subjects such as Calculus, Physics, and Chemistry in Korean or their national language. Three words that describe me really good is: happy funny and sometimes bothersome A thing that i would like that people knew is that its not a good idea that wake me when im sleeping. Secondly, do more cooperation between countries.To illustrate, people should cooperation To intervene to bring peace to the world to stop the war in many areas like what United Nations doing.For example, United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy . It all started in the Parson Institute in the class of art history students of the race of Fine Arts in the class the teacher in charge, Jimena, commissioned a task to his students, saying: -To Begin with this course, I want to be sure they know the meaning of art, pro I want it translated into a sculpture or painting made by yourselves, without any specific technique, only your imagination, with it you explain to me what it is art. In later time, society feel the need for change about iniquities that pass in the country and the Mexican Revolution explotes, the building is abandoned because the government and country dont have money for construction, to the point the building  metal estructure was used as weapons. However, at college, professors just give lecture to students. in my personal obinionits better to lern froma teacher not only dat you lern to pronounce the words correctly you also lern from a personwhat is in my opinion way better i thin k we spend enougth time on smart phones so i dont think its the best if we use them to lern as well. This book made me interesting and I begging reading more and more while I read the more I love it  this time everything  did not matter to me I want to finish the book  as soon as possible I do not know the end but I want the end of the book was amazing but the same time I do not finish the book because the mystery to open up finished in. In this situation, learning subjects in English makes students more hard to adjust to college. It is not too late to study subjects in English later when they finish freshman year. i dont think the public transport does not have future, there are a lot of people who can not buy a car and has to use the communite transport. In KAIST, the rate of students who graduated from science high school is much higher than from regular high school. To sum up, do sports is very important for teenagers to which the body is going to grow and do it regularly is commitment that we should take. For example, regular high school students hardly do experiment and they learn subjects that are recommended to learn by nation. But science high school students learn calculus, physics, chemistry in more deep to the point that are learned in the university when they are freshman. In addition, stress is a clear disadvantage of compete because competitiors are trying to win and this can frustrates.But, some people do not think this like this and take it more simply Finally, I think that to compete in sports has some benefits and disadvantages, but when is controlated there are some benefits that help you to whole you life. television entertains as well as it will educate the people.These days are educating themselves by watching the television.Televison not only provide entertainment it will give lots of information about the happenings around the globe.Channels like national geographic and animal planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origination of species.Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people Moreover, it will help students to get interested in studying. After having hard time studying to enter KAIST when they were high school students, students don't want to study harder and want to enjoy the life of campus. Peter drove his car to the doctor's clinic and after half an hour he arrived and he and his grandmother go above through the stairs to reach the doctor's clinic after they arrived they found that they have to stay aperiod of time to take his turn they waited and then their turn came .they entered the doctor and the doctor was very kind he welcomed them and after check    peter's grandmother. at last I wanna talk about my cousins , I love the most of them especially the cousin in the same age , they are my friends , i love too much ,and also the rest of my family In order not to this situation happen, giving lecture in Korea will help students to be interested in studying. For these reasons, it will be efficient to provide Korean lecture for freshmen. squash sport also can be played individually as two players together or in team of 4 players.squash one of the very nice attractive sports It will be great to provide English lecture after freshman year when students well adapt to university lecture and know the way of studying for subjects in KAIST."	1

"Tennis, tennis is not jsut a sport anyone can play but it's professional sport needs to more hard trainee and more time to be perfect in it, in first why I choose tennis?, seriously in 2003 this is my first time to watch the game on TV when I saw roger federer played I think he is the one that made me love this sport, due to it's professional motion in playing the ball, from this time I was interested in this game and watching all championship, so more time, time and time it was my favoirite sport. I played so good that everyone gave me congratulations but thats not all one of the best team of the world wanted too take me. One way computer help is that students can do their school work online and see their teachers pages. But a good change of our habit is attention to calery food and healthy food because of get information on internet and another media that are accessible way for all people easily these days. I'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant its name is ""Lemon"" I go there every week it has different food from any restaurants I'd like chicken crispy with garlic sauce It's Excellent choice for me and My favorite appitizer is susage and in order that desert I'd rather ""Vadge"" cake with chocolate sauce I feel I;m at ease when I go there I enjoy  classical music over having a lunch about the service It's very good and all staff are respectable I can't imagine one week without going there that drives me nuts I advise any one to go there and enjoy  a time there , also this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really It's  excellent This strikingly thing for anyone  despite all of these advantages prices are not expensive . What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player ,i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families, Without computers students would have it a lot worse. When a student forgets the homework, they can just go on their teachers online page and check what he assignment was for that night. My favorite way to travel is the Plane because  I like to be fast and in my life, I hate a wait in my opinion the plane is the best for me for example when you want to go  somewhere you need to reach there so quick , you don't need to take time and The plane is the best travelling in the world that the best safer than other way  , you can see on the pollution of people who got an accident , how often an accident happen by the plane so anyway if it's happen,i can't imagine it , Eventually I wish everyone who like to travel is safe and sound and safe journey. I love my small family.My family members are very helpful and supportive.My parents are very support.My parents are my best friends and guides.If any problems faced ,i'm went to my parents and say the problem,there are solve the problem.My family is my world.My parents are the good guides.There are my role model.some times we were go to the tour programs,it's very happy moments.My mammy told the story in night.Mom make the special foods in festivals. People complaint about how the information about different TV shows don't contribute in the process of learning, that's why many of This programmes are considered trash, because of the multiples shows such as realities, talk shows,or showbiz that hardly ever have a good message or something interesting for people. Life is unpredictable and unforseen.The immense possibilities of life  give us opportunity to explore life but some times   it lead to threat and dangers to our life.We surely pray for the best life of our dear and near ones.But insurance is also necessity and invetable for peace of mind .It gives us surety to live life securely.It just not only to save our life but also secure assets like houses cars etc. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately.He had to buy a present for his girlfriend´s birthday but it was Sunday and all stores were closed so he had to found a solution.A few hours,he was walking by a garden,and suddenly,he saw the most beautiful flowers that he has ever seen,so he picked them up.However,flowers weren´t enough so he decided to think in anything else.Several hours later,he found an open sweet shop and he bought some bonbons for her.Finally,he had found the present and before the end of the day he ran quickly to his girlfriend's house.If you don't want to pass this situation,you must always do things with time. Already public transport have been improvement and that makes comfortable to go on a trip,but I think that will be able to become good quality more and more,because so many people expectation. Also, many people want to go to destinations but do not know how to get there. The internet provides them with directions for them on how to reach their destination in a quick and efficient manner. An extremely important and helpful aspect of the internet is the ability of purchasing and ordering items online. Before someone decides to but something, they can find out all sorts of information about the product and shop around for the lowest price. Also, just for young children that are in process of growth and development, physical exercise is essential to do it, because they can have a healthier life.Young children try to effort, and wants to win at this age, and if they train results were better and encourages to keep training.In psychic way, if you are adapated forms relations and create new friends. Everyone eagerly waiting for the ambulance arrival but still not yet reached the reason is our college location is little far from the city that's why it is getting late. Even though do not everyone doing that,so how much public office is care of environment is important and this town is care of that a lot.Every morning some peasons are coming park and cleaned that makes feel really thanksgratitude. now days young people are influence towards the western culture so,they are getting more fashionable.youngster are interested to wear different stylish and colored clothes.they are happy with wearing different color clothes.they didn't want to wear our cultural dress such as sari,dhoti,choli and many more.they only like to wear shirt,pant skirt,t shirt and many more.youngster are influence by watching different programmes on  television. Buisnesses also heavily rely on the internet to keep in touch with their clients that keep them in buisness. Espesialy there are a lot of greens these makes good health.However someone have to take care of them.The town have to do that and I think in England there are so many greens all around,so a lot of people take care of these that makes good environment.After I have been to live in England with my family I have goton the feel very much indeed. Above all, people depend heavily on social networking sites to keep intouch with friends, keep up to date on the news, and have fun talking to people. Without the internet, probably half of the world communications would be down and that would not be good. Computers, without do have positive effect on society. When it can be an educational resource it is very helpful.

20	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Education has a crucial part in one society and it’s future and by improving the level of educations system, students can learn more effectively in their entire education life and their career but also their skills will be improved by this process. We have stooped to the level of installing offensive materials in libraries where anyone can check them out. I suggested to other people  first to understand yourself such as  what do you like, which is possible and than practice after every success Also 'internet' in our days helps to get information all over the world, and if you wish to get involved then go to the www.bbc.co.uk.These sites are free way to find most adequate information about actual events both in society and technical life. I strongly feel this disturing and destructive material should be removed from the shelves of libraries. Technology advance way to fast and it is really difficult guessing what kind of stuff or artefacts will be fifty years from now, but we can guess some ideas like flying cars, smartphones with the size of a small paper, laptops really thin like quarter of inch, clothes that clean itself or change the color and shape, healthier food, smarter electrodomestics.

The mas was armed try to steal the backpack.But he not be fixed that the man was a camera in his head and hi action was filmed. Travelling by car is much more convenient but all know really there is no future for public transport.When we talk about public transport,there are many people and everyone travel but i think we do not feel relax are there and if we talk about travelling by car.It is the best or much more convenient for us.Because we can travel any where but in public transport we can not travel to any other sites Well it seems to me that this malicious material makes the main character and hero of the story a bad role model. They @MONTH1 save the world and be a hero by day, but authors and producers make sure they include their night life in the story as well. one day Michael decided to make a surprise party to sinha to make her happy and feel his love more so he arranged everything and to keep it surprise to her he was busy all the time and did not show off all the week as usual .that make sinha worried and suspect that Michael do not love her any more and know another girl and she become extremely sad and even it become worse when Michael asked her to go to his apartment to make  the surprise to her  but he did not answer his phone after that . he took the money the second day , he finished the registration and started in writing the story after long time spending in writing and did good job he went to give his story to the international student magazine office ,he found out there are a notice on the door say that the competition has canceled, he came back vey sad and told me what happened .Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake .

21	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"To achieve success in life, there are two ways: taking risks or chances and careful planning. Both methods have their pros and cons, but there is no way to return when the taking risk is ruined. I have learned to  get control of myself when someone teaes me , and to be alert as well .Also ,it helps to look always slim and put me away from the ghost of obesity as well .People who want to start playing karate have to be patient .

The government can to improve the public transport making a great investmenting like changing the old vehicles for new and increase the number the bus, trains and build more bus station and trains station this kind the action will help a lot the quality of the public transport for population and will become the life of the people more easy. television entertains as well as it will educate the people.These days are educating themselves by watching the television.Televison not only provide entertainment it will give lots of information about the happenings around the globe.Channels like national geographic and animal planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origination of species.Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people If people want to achieve success, they need to plan carefully. in modern day there is very little public transpotr are used,ganeral public prefer much faster and conveninece  ways of traveling  around.though the pulic transport are used in mager citys to avoied traffic conjustion,it is wlidly reconizge that public transport are eco friendly. In the process to achieve success, they need courage from families and friends. Summer holiday, I have been to Italy on holiday 3 years ago.I didn't have a long holiday ,it was just for 3 days but these 3 days were the best in my life.I must say that I went there because my sister is living there so I didn't have to book a room at the hotel and spending too much money.I went to the Vatican and Rome,I saw their massive buildings which were impressive and their old houses.The weather was fantastic ,I love bathing in the sun and resting on the hot sand on the beach. Through this, they can persuade families and friends, also at the same time they can remind their goal. It is a very important process to achieve success effectively. Some people might say that success in life comes from taking risks or chances, but it is not true. i think that this is the guestion for every one, and the answer can't be one for all, cause, someone can use public transport, and economy by this not only money, but and the environment, but some people don't like to use p.t., cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple don't like to travell with another people. In conclusion the public transport is very good and if it desapear it will be a big problem, is right that some times you need a private transport but apart from that the public transport is very use by people of all ages. One of the example is television, in the past we use it only for watching news and movie, but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t, now television has others function. Therefore, people should not get deceived by those who achieve success in life by taking risks, yet planning their way to achieve success. Every people want to achieve success in their life. Also, they all know"	1

Firstly,hyrid cars only allowed to use during weekends as result of this most people not using there cars all the week. You should be upset and lose your appetite.

At first and important change is about eating prepared food that isn't healthy usually,its reason probably woman's life stile that is going to big change in the way that they don't like staying at home and spend their time to making food ,now they prefer to buy prepared good. Tottaly l think changing is ignorable but we can control it to make our life better,specially about food that is most important aspect of ourlife but we don't pay attention to it enough. To my mind our lives has been improved in these years by smarphone, satnav, digital TV, Internet.. Let's suppose a teenager of twenty-first century during the Middle ages.. don't get out alive without Wi-fii! In the future,people will go out of the Earth .Because of the damage,people on the ground can't survive.When they want to find foods,there will be nothing.Even of the grass can't alive on earth.Thought,but most people do not be the member of the team of alive.Cause of lots of damage,but they didn't Take responsibility.I wonder for sixteen years.And I don't know if they were change their mind in after the next fifty years. Some people guess the nuclear power has a great value to produce power instead of the fossil fuels such as : coals and oil which are Not renewable energy.Moreover, they think that controlling the pollution is possible. The computer supplies the user or student with a wide variety of information. The computer aids the user with vast information on every subject or topic that @MONTH1 be brought up in a class room.

By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we don't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars don't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport.

On one hand you put all your things in the car and drive anywhere you want to, on the other hand if you feel not very well to drive, you have no money to buy a car or the downtown of your city is closed for all the means of transport except for the public ones: tram, bus or trolley bus is your wayout. It is true that we are a lot of users that want to use the car but, and that amount is  growing up; as well there are a lot of people that don't have the posibility to have a car and some use the public transportation because many reasons like the price, because it is easier to get to the place by public transportation rather than car, because the traffic, some times for people it is so exhausting to drive lots of hours an even some times the public transportation is faster. The use of computers all the time can effect people's health, family and friends, and their apprciation of Nature. So,my favourite sport in the present time it is street workout.I have been exercising this sport already long time.I like to exercise on the street even in the season when the temperature outside below zero.Of course, in summer I like to exercise more than in winter but this don't stop me.I don't know myself why,but I almost every day go on the street in order to exercise.If  It is very coldly and windily outside,I don't worry about it and I'm exsercising at home.For those people, who want to start to exercise the street workout I'm advising to start with basic exerscises such as pull ups,push ups,dips and squats.That everything basic exercises and they will help you will do a good start up.After some time when you will be feeling that you are ready for more, you can start to study more difficult exercises.

Fifty minutes passed ,when my body no longer was sore.I decided to walk to the end.Constantly,I just walked like without terminal contest.While I strugged to walk.Finally,I saw a light to appeare my eyes and I woke up.

No one can experience the greatness of nature while on the computer. No one can experience the feel of cool lake water sliding over their skin or a hot @DATE1 day while emailing a friend.

Most people want to succeed in their goals; however, it does not always go the way that they think. Some argue that careful planning causes the success while others argue that success in life comes from taking risks and chances. FILM: LUCY (2014) TThe plot of this film is about a 25 naive woman that was living and studying in Taiwan and one night went out for clubbing and met a nutter guy that involved her in a seedy drug smuggling issue with a Corean criminal band that forced her to be a mule drug. It is true that we are a lot of users that want to use the car but, and that amount is  growing up; as well there are a lot of people that don't have the posibility to have a car and some use the public transportation because many reasons like the price, because it is easier to get to the place by public transportation rather than car, because the traffic, some times for people it is so exhausting to drive lots of hours an even some times the public transportation is faster. Consider both aspects that can be concluded that government should respect the human right and set up a new department which use for people who want to apply to complete the military service. For example, a famous restaurant went bankrupt due to COVID 19. I don´t have friends who like swimming, almost like football or similar teams sports, and always I go alone it isn´t boring for me furthermore, I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I haven´t wait anybody.

Most importantly,manually inspected on each printed sheet in case that there would exist damaged sheets.Once damaged sheets are discovered, partically separate them into good and bad ones and them burn the bad notes,making sure that the remaining sheets are of good quality . Our Mistakes mistake made us better than before if in life we had't got any mistake  we wouldn't succeed that's why  the mistakes are very important in life and I believe  our mistake improve us so but in another way there just one mistake and you could not come back or arranged your mistake Ture success comes from spirit of challenging. squash sport also can be played individually as two players together or in team of 4 players.squash one of the very nice attractive sports They die when John was too little to remember and he never know what happened so he went to all the parts for saw them even he walked and walked even at reverse but he never found them.

Transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible Achieving good results in such a big choice is the shortcut to success. My town is very beautiful and I like it very much because it is not any dirty streets in it  The governor of my city seek to develop it and he said it will be the capital of delta actually after 30 years ago the people in my town deal with rubbish by healthy method , the citizens collecting the rubbish and threw it in big boxes far away the city.

For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"All of the memories that I've shared with my friends over the years are marked by the expression of an emotion. Her sons have a problem they cant see the natural light and one they Grace got up because her children were shouting and crying so she went to their bedroom and the courtins was not there so she go to the other room and the courtins also were not there so she stars getting nervous and more nervous so she go and talk to the servants, so she got very angry and she told them go out of my house and they did not care so she pick up a gun and the old lady returned her keys. Travelling by car is convenient but there are dis advantage as well.As our population growing fast in a family both husband and wife working and children at university able to drive, so you are looking per house least 3 cars, so imagine how busy our roads will be.As now fuel price coming down that does not mean that it will stay like that for ever, price go up and down. That means he is a careless, who always drives too fast  But public transport has advantages: If we uses it is the essential transport to travel. Firstly, the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel.Secondly, the public vehicle route are more far than usual route.Thirdly,it is also crowded and no privacy.Finally,there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker.

Technology advance way to fast and it is really difficult guessing what kind of stuff or artefacts will be fifty years from now, but we can guess some ideas like flying cars, smartphones with the size of a small paper, laptops really thin like quarter of inch, clothes that clean itself or change the color and shape, healthier food, smarter electrodomestics.

I love to listen to British English, but it’s really hard to study, all because we are all learning American English in Taiwan, so when I have the opportunity to contact British English, it’s full of tone cadence, always feel particularly charming, and British culture exudes noble temperament, so British accent sounds like there is always an indescribable elegance qualities. However, she soon changed her mind and since the car was going slow enough, she climbed on the hood and we continued driving, slowly. We were about two hundred feet from @LOCATION1's house, just one small bend before we'd be there, when @PERSON1 realized that if her grandparents, who live right next door, saw us, then she'd be in trouble. She didn't care to enlighten the rest of us with the details of her mental observation and suddenly stopped in the middle of the driveway. @PERSON2 slid off the hood, granted we were only going about eight miles an hour, and momentum pushed her forward at a trot. Pass some years  of the university and he know a girl called Kate and he get loved on here and she get loved in him. Actually, we have a lot of problem with traffic: lots of cars in the railway and it don't running; the number of cars in the street cause a dirty pollution;  crawded railways causes a later destination. She then stood up, turned to face us, and burst into hysteric laughter. We all let out a collective sigh and burst into hysterics as well, remaining in the same spot for a good five minutes. All of us were near tears and out of breath from laughing about the sight, we laughed randomly together throughout the rest of the day, and told all of our other friends about it. We had realized that it was a stupid thing to do, and @PERSON2 could have been hurt. But she wasn't, and so we all shared in the camaraderie of the moment. Laughter has that ability to connect people. It takes effort to make someone laugh, to spark the emotional trigger inside them that tells their brain, ""@CAPS2, I'm having fun."" @CAPS3 crying is a sign of extreme sadness, laughter is a sign of joy and elation, an indication of happiness. It shows that you're enjoying what you're doing and want those around you to recognize it. Spent half an hour after we arrived, started coming everybody, there were many greetings, thanks, hugs, kisses, and then we all went to the table, which was magnificently structured, plenty of food of all kinds, drinks, but we were all waiting for the main course, also the food was magnificent, but the best part was when the couple went to the pool, we were lucky we had an amazing wedding planner who arranged the magnificent and fun activities, he said to the bride and groom enter each an inflatable ball and try walking on the water as long as withstand, and the bride won because the groom slipped and fell after them, out of the ball, fell into the water, and kissed.

29	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that doesn't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used,so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground. However, KAIST has two critical disadvantages, which would be told below paragraphs. If I could change one important thing about my university, I would establish a college of liberal arts, which can solve these critical disadvantages. As well, we have to promote that the people get jobs close their accommodation or get the accommodation close to the jobs, because we have too much pollution and we could reward the companies that hire staff close to the place of job, maybe in a circle of 4 kilometres, as well we could reward the people that turn their accommodation for live near to the job or for going  there by a bicycle. Most people of KAIST have similar childhood such as graduated science high school or gifted school, being interested in science and math from when they are young. I suggested to other people  first to understand yourself such as  what do you like, which is possible and than practice after every success Often the evolution is return of origins however I hope that the man in the next years will be to don't forget the past. Second, KAIST has a bias gender rate. Most of the organizations known how is affect managemant acountant practice on them work , therefore they are chossing good programme and employee. However, public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a new car and for the adventurer who want to have an exciting travel for then to see more action.Like watching outside or sight seeing,to mingle and meet different people.In addition to this I also admire the bullet train in japan which u consider fast and safe public vehicle Ive'd known. It is important to know how to deal with different gender people. it can never be regained even the strongest monarchs have been helpless to prevent time.So should be careful about the importance of time .I hope to not waste it and use it as the best use for giving opportunity for rising .Those who waste it ,will be behind and they will fail to make a mark in their life.The great men and successful guys became fame and rose by a suitable use for time .They guide and source of inspiration for a new generation. Female have also problem. They have few same gender friends who can share their difficulty. Thus, by establishing a college of liberal arts, KAIST can increase a rate of female students. sukh was so angry with him because he heart her a lot, sukh refuse to give her laptop and her brother start again fighting with her and even he slapped her sister. But now I really enjoyed, and me best friend both for me ticket for a theatre to see the musical show ,which was amazing, for cuople of hours I didn't move, was a brilliant present. Another example of why lives are gonna changed completely in 50 years is because also that connection between others cultures make People concern more about her own health, the expectations of life and the way they want to live it, because everyday will be easier to see how much are we hearting the earth so we will see faster the impacts that this brings to our life.

On the rest of the boring week, I was watching TV and suddenly my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet, so I decided to solve my Paris puzzles with my sister, which was less than a half solved for about one year but it had too much color in the sky so I didn't finished then a year ago. First of all, in my perspective, having a computer, allows me to communicate to people I've met on past vacations. this country are many interesting pLaces to visit,if you wantto have adventure you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza.If you want to have fun you may go to parque de la Costa there are many interesting rolercoasters.And if you want to go the best museum of art in Argentina you should go to malba.

One day many years ago in something place that a don't remember the name I woke up one morning more earlier than usual then I went to the kitchen and shout the name of my mother...but no one answered, and the first thing that I imagine is that they come to the town, quickly I went out to find they... But there was no one, absolutely no one, I'm scary, I yell and scream, look and look but I had no result  Suddenly I felt a warm hand that touched my shoulder and very slowly turn but the only thing I saw was a shadow that was holding a knife     I woke up and realised it had all been a bad dream In conclusion, being able to communicate with others on a computer, is only I, of the many benefits a computer has! Second of all, not only does having a computer allow you to talk to others but it can teach you hand-eye coordination as well. Dereck was a channel @NUM1 news reporter, ""I can hit some far balls that take the cake for some of our games. One night,as usual,I slept.In a flash,I rolled down from a mountain and I didn't know where I was.It just a very long tunnel where was dark and strange,After,I felt my body ache.I began to yell that hoped someone could  save me to leave from here. In my opinion ,Volleyball must then be considered among high-risk sports according to the frequency and gravity of our surgical findings.my advice for who starts this sport you will get fresh after you play this game and makes you doing your work in relaxetion way . Firstly, Django Unchained remembered us the hard life suffered by black people in the past, due to a great introduction without dialogues, where black people were unchained while they came back to be selling to an owner farm, it being matching with an amanzing soundtrack as identity Tarantino´s films. Fifty minutes passed ,when my body no longer was sore.I decided to walk to the end.Constantly,I just walked like without terminal contest.While I strugged to walk.Finally,I saw a light to appeare my eyes and I woke up. On the other hand, businessman, parents, and even teachers use the internet to learn about things around the world and to gather information to teach their classes. Overall, computers have many benefits such as they allow you to communicate with others, they teach you hand-eye coordination, and even allow you to learn about things and places around the world. As a whole, this intelligent invention of the computer is an incredible machine that seems to have all the answers and a success for realiable information!"	1

I like a car as well,but when I have to driving a car I have to think about parking a lot and I can't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am having travel,so the public transport is making connection with human beings.It is why I think public transport is really important for public and there are a lot of important thing is having a possble in the future. Hi,I am Amy.I would like to spend two months studying in English,two months doing volunteering in children charity and the least two months travelling in UK.What do you think of my plan?I will not only improve my English skills but also devote myself to get along with children.The most important of all,I will take an adventure to the unknown place in UK.I am looking forward to seeing you soon.I would like to invite you to join the road trip with me.it must be an amazing experience if we are together for this trip.As long as you can go with me just let me know. Second advantage is Internet by website, such as twiter, facebook... You allow speak with your quick friend, or you can meet ith them by website, therefore you do not call by telephone, so internet is too much cheap. I'll tell you a story happened  at school   as any normal pouring day  when you  teenager in school never ever end, but a one day was the best day from any  other pouring normal day because i learn how  live as powerful smart girl who used to let the other us her because she want to feel needed from my friends but i did not have many friends in school except  ""Michael"". Getting up early solves this problem. Second, I can do morning exercise. In the morning, I am still tired, but I can start my day refreshing by exercise. In addition, if I exercise early in the morning, I can exercise again at night. i think that this is the guestion for every one, and the answer can't be one for all, cause, someone can use public transport, and economy by this not only money, but and the environment, but some people don't like to use p.t., cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple don't like to travell with another people. If the public transport will be by higher quality, faster and fewer rates, majority of citizens will be prefer: is more calm to relax and read a newpaper or a magazine during the way in a collective transport than an indiivdual one; moreover, the time spend up to go and came back will be reduced, because it promotes less car in the railway. Delivery food is quite expensive, so I can save my money just by not eating it. Lastly, I can see the sunlight much more. When I sleep alte at night and wake up late in the afternoon, I can see the sunlight only in a short time of the day. after that the celebration was began and a lot of their friends have attended each one presented a gift for Sara , she was very delighted and suddenly the doorbell been rang  she was her old friend Tia . Changing the life pattern looks easy, but it does not. Through this vacation, I will try to change my life pattern. With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of population,many agricultueal land,forest and ocesn had been used to destroyed to build more constructure and transport networks.From my own perspective,I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human  and animals. That means he is a careless, who always drives too fast  But public transport has advantages: If we uses it is the essential transport to travel."	1

"basketball needs that the person should be tall enough to play it .i like basketball because it makes me happy,fit,have self_confidence and makes me active .if anyone want to play basketball ,he should do many exercises and try to be able to play it because everything is difficult at first but we shouldn't give up . Some people said, “Online courses are not good.” However, online courses are highly advantageous to both students and professors. The government can to improve the public transport making a great investmenting like changing the old vehicles for new and increase the number the bus, trains and build more bus station and trains station this kind the action will help a lot the quality of the public transport for population and will become the life of the people more easy. Spent half an hour after we arrived, started coming everybody, there were many greetings, thanks, hugs, kisses, and then we all went to the table, which was magnificently structured, plenty of food of all kinds, drinks, but we were all waiting for the main course, also the food was magnificent, but the best part was when the couple went to the pool, we were lucky we had an amazing wedding planner who arranged the magnificent and fun activities, he said to the bride and groom enter each an inflatable ball and try walking on the water as long as withstand, and the bride won because the groom slipped and fell after them, out of the ball, fell into the water, and kissed. Already public transport have been improvement and that makes comfortable to go on a trip,but I think that will be able to become good quality more and more,because so many people expectation. Most of online courses are video lectures, so it’s possible to repeat infinitely unless students press the stop button. Michael is a good boy and he always listen to his mother .on time Michael was very angry as he got a bad score in his test .when he was home his mother was cooking she asked him what is the wrong ? Moreover, student could control speed of taking course. Each student has different learning speed, so it’s very nice merit for student. It could be a better method of education. We separated paper from glass and also to plastic.The garbage picks up paper once a week,plastic two times at month and undiferretiated three times a week to all people who live in my country.My district makes clean my village and it usually tries to make attractive with new social initiatives for the community. I have to start saying that I never imagine swimming like my favorite sport, because until my back´s injury, I practiced other sports, I most like extreme sports like downhill, skateboarding martial arts like Aikido, jiujitsu or ninjutsu, but for my injury I have to start swimming and now I love it. According to the problems above mentioned,various approaches that governmentshould be adopted to deal with this problem.first of all,reducing building constructure from now on,planting more trees instead.Sustainadle development should be awaness to all human and start to porteat the environment and preserve the animals. Offline courses could prevent the situation effectively. I think that the  public  transport always going to be so important in our life  because  not all the people have the possibility to buy a car because the public transport is more expensive than a car, so for that reason the public transport in the future  could be exist, because public transport is a necesity in all the world not only for the money but too for the facility to take a bus or any other public transport Mohammed is a kindly prophet born in small city called mekka and travelled to another city closed to mekka called almadina cause the people of mekka were very aggressive and they not accepted the new Invitation for the new religio Mohammed came back to his town mekka after that and forgave the people of mekka whose abused him Students could preview by online lecture easily before the class. It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. Online courses are trend of education over the world. about my rest of family , as I said before they are just a relatives , but even if they are not friends almost ,but I do love them to much ,first one is my aunt ,the dead one ,and the other who still alive ,but i don't feel that felling of love towards my uncle , I do love him ,but he is just my uncle no more . Let’s take the online course and learn more effectively together!"	1

Nowadays, transportation is important since most people live in cities that need vehicle to move far. Therefore, governments from various countries concern about spending money to improve roads and highways, or public transportation. Her sons have a problem they cant see the natural light and one they Grace got up because her children were shouting and crying so she went to their bedroom and the courtins was not there so she go to the other room and the courtins also were not there so she stars getting nervous and more nervous so she go and talk to the servants, so she got very angry and she told them go out of my house and they did not care so she pick up a gun and the old lady returned her keys. No matter what year, its lowest level always in Jan-Mar.May be because this paragraph of time the weather was cold, the purchaser greatly reduced.We can be seen from the diagram,  the highest peak in the has increased year by year, as the low as. Michael is a good boy and he always listen to his mother .on time Michael was very angry as he got a bad score in his test .when he was home his mother was cooking she asked him what is the wrong ? To maintain clean environments with convenience, spending money to improve public transportation is the best way. Second, improving public transportation costs less than improving roads and highways. To improve roads and highways, the government need to find out less efficient roads, destroy them, and make new one; however, to improve public transportation, they just need to increase the number of them, or change the line of them. There are many sports grounds for example tennis cort,football grounds and play equipment for child so I think my town takes care of environment that makes everyone will be able to best condition in both mind and body long time. I am on third year at the university, I don't know what will be the master than I go to make, but I want a master relationed with programming. To start with,there are a wide range of troublesome it maybe leadding to this phenomeon.Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the persent day cities are already packed with places of residence,commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce.Additionally, people now continues destroyed more agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their need,which will distory the ecosystem  diversity and biodiversity especially the endangered species.

It is large, clean and  comforktable and has air conditioning and internet wifi  it introduces many kinds of delicious foods like meat, cheeken ,sea foods and if you want anything different you will find it  there .it is suitable for my class because it is difference from any other restaurant I think one of my favorites sports of all is the atletism I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself, you have to be every day better than you where yesterday, it force you to improve every time, also is an exercise that help all your body, especially the legs because it gives them great strength, but also your hands because they have to be in a constant movement, and all the body in general because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and help you to have coordination."	1
34	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"i love my family special my little sister, she has sixteen years old, i consider my best friend because i used to tell her everything of my life. The computers we use in society do not harm us in any way! They are a huge step forward for mankind and only benefit our lives. cars are faster than public transport so cars are more convenient than public transport it is easier ,faster and more comfortable especially in long distances so governments should improve public transport as not all people have cars After we came to the ambulance,police come and one patrol was catching those man who made that to that granny and the other patrol was talking to us.I found out that granny name is Rose and she had got operation after the accident. many countries are truly started to concern no environment and worried about the globe warming ,In schools teachers are doing their best  to educate children how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy,also they train them how to plant trees in public gardens of their towns ,Although  government strict so many laws and taxes in the people how do not pay their taxes to the council for cleaning of the rubbish from towns and villages,in the biggest polluted city in the world people started to use bicycles and cycling instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city,also they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive. Environment is the sorrounding.there is no aleartness in our locality.they were busy in their own work.everyone were not focus or see what hapening in our place.they use to speak about how hot today is?but they dont know what makes this much hot.iam interest in planting tree and makes sorrounding clean.some people used to burn forest as if those forest is useless.man are greedy  because of all the thing  getting from the forest are free. Yes,I think it also can educate.As times go by,technology is rapidly improving.More and more gadgets are invented such as televisions,smartphones and so on.There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly.Using will not only gain the entertainment but also get the knowledge.For instance,there are numerous program that we can choose.It is a good time to turn to the entertaining program,when we feel bored and gaze the wall all the day.Television provides educated varieties of channels as well.Discovery channel is posture-oriented model example to educate.We can learn how do the different animals feed on themselves.Above the statements can ensure a rich and abundant live. All one has to do is find a site such as @ORGANIZATION1, type there question, and millions of answers pop up assuring a solution to the problem. we all know that do sport is very important to keep our life healthy and happy.My favourite sport actually is walking;and I prefer walking in the morning and before sundown.I like also walking in public street,gardens,clubs and on the shore.when i want to go anywhere;I do my best to go on foot.I like this sport since my childhood because I found that I can think about my good time when I was child and relax with myself to think carefully about my present and future.The walking can also fitness and do the knee stronger.It would be interesting to accompain your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time.I advice my guys who suffer from laziness and overweight,try to walk one hour at least and after that they will like this sport. Our Mistakes mistake made us better than before if in life we had't got any mistake  we wouldn't succeed that's why  the mistakes are very important in life and I believe  our mistake improve us so but in another way there just one mistake and you could not come back or arranged your mistake What you @MONTH1 have looked for in books and papers can be easily found on internet at the click of a button. Clearly, computers are a huge source of knowledge for our society. But i was so mad at him and so ansiouns to make his life imposible, and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the sufering i had been throug became stronger and bigger, i had made a desition i was goingo to do it, if he dedicated 4 years of his life tourtoring me and not wanting me to be happy i would the time is nesesary for him to have a miserable life and i wont stop until i had acomplished my goald Most of the labours will probably have been represented by machinery, the people who is lack of academic might be very hard to get a job, the knowledge might be demand if the people live in the future. Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath...deep one and started to dive . First, you should know is the weather, we have a very cold winter and a hot summer compared with the other countries in the middle east.If you want a city with sea you should choose any city in the west or east of Saudi Arabia.Riyadh is the capital City it's in the center of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.All the stores and malls are closed at mid night include the five prays breaks because we need to go for pray for work you need to know what the major you want to work in so I can help you to search for a good job matching you abilities. Everyone eagerly waiting for the ambulance arrival but still not yet reached the reason is our college location is little far from the city that's why it is getting late. All they need to do is select the items they wish to purchase and await for its arrival a few days later. Clearly, the computer and internet can help support the welfare of buisnesses. Finally, the computers we use today are a huge and easy way of communication. and we must lern children that clean is necessary for their health and on their school they should throw rubbish on Waste basket and who throw it on the ground Will be punished . You could send a letter with the touch of a button with out having to make a trip down to the post office and await a reply. Nowadays, public transport is used for many people in the cities, we can find different types of them, such as bus tube and train, but is there a future for it or not?, I am going to respond this question giving disadvantanges and advantages and  finally I give my personal opinion. my favorite sport is swimming i swim 2 times per a week sometimes i go to the swimming pool in the same area which i work there and sometimes i go to the swimming pool of my cousin, i enjoy when i spend my time in the water and now even i am pregnant i am afraid when i swim with a group of people i keep telling them and screaming do not close with me ! so, on my opinion, even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers MOTASSEM is nice and lovely fiance he love his job as he is Patient will dong has jop .he is  a  hard worker he has amazing laughs     .When you started  talk with him you will be inspire by his knowledge and his way of talk he have the talent to Convinces  thought. There are many sports grounds for example tennis cort,football grounds and play equipment for child so I think my town takes care of environment that makes everyone will be able to best condition in both mind and body long time. Everyone as agreed to this without hesitation so you should too. Computers are the best things that have ever happened to our society today."	1
35	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There are different opinions regarding whether student take classes in many subjects or specialize in one subject. If difficulties was told to the families, the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation. We the management of The Arch London Hotel received your mail and wishes to let you know that you should make known to us the position you desired to work in via return mail along with a scan copy of your signed contract of agreement to enable us make every necessary corrections.Thank you. My favourite sport is playing tennis.I play it three times a week (on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays) in the club of tui.I had been playing tennis from 2 years ago with two of my best friends.I enjoy playing tennis because it is a sport that requires skills, concentration and speed.I am not very good at all but I like to play it with my friends and do matches on Saturdays . Compare time between students to specialize in one subject and take many subjects, it is clear that student who study one subject have many time. However, I have no agree with this statement because the public transport is needed for someone who are no have vehicle or economic downturn. when you have desire to do something, somehing you always dream to achieve it , something is touch you inside when not only do it but also when think about. This experiences make students better. Further, it is true that studying one subject is efficient because they can graduate earlier. But we don't have forgotten the cotamination by cars, We can use more the bicycle or public transportetion. However, if student study many major, it is hard to graduate in 4 years. In KAIST many student study multiple major. However, many students who study multiple major graduate at 5 years. First of all,swim can help your health.The research declined that swim can decrease disease.Second,swim can relax yourself.When you in the water,you will feel relax.Third,swim can get more friend.You can go to the swimming club,that is a way to meet people with interesting of same.You can try this sport from now on. Nowadays public transportation is included almost all around the planet, We can admit that the transport revolution has been plave  in the last century but due to the globalization and technological development, the transport sector is always in a continuos transformation: In the other hand we must remarque how the plane sector has been grown, currently is the most common way of transport for going away and that's also means than the shipping factory has decreaced deeply, in order to let the plane market blomm. Yesterday ,I had a wonderful day  .In the morning I went to a Galician basketball training with a coach of Spanish selection ,when  finished went to my parents to a hotel to eat and stay with some friends , after the food meet with  friend´s of my parents and went to a theme park and we rode to a rollers coaster, it was very exciting and we ate a chocolate ice cream, it was delicious .At night we went to a match  of Spanish basketball league, Obradoiro versus Real Madrid and that match won the team of Real Madrid and then I went home to sleep. No matter what year, its lowest level always in Jan-Mar.May be because this paragraph of time the weather was cold, the purchaser greatly reduced.We can be seen from the diagram,  the highest peak in the has increased year by year, as the low as. Finally, some people might think that study many subjects must helpful to students because they can build their multi capacity. However, this is not true. In our earth, Hunderds of millions prople living in here.Except us, There are also a large number of wildlife. First of all,friends are important for us,we want a friend that we can share our secrets and problems.But friends maybe in the future go away or hurt you!So you can't always based on them!For example,they need you until they find someone better than you and in the end they go away.But family never let you go or family never go away from you! He think that this politics make them can not focus on their own major. i love my family special my little sister, she has sixteen years old, i consider my best friend because i used to tell her everything of my life. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately.He had to buy a present for his girlfriend´s birthday but it was Sunday and all stores were closed so he had to found a solution.A few hours,he was walking by a garden,and suddenly,he saw the most beautiful flowers that he has ever seen,so he picked them up.However,flowers weren´t enough so he decided to think in anything else.Several hours later,he found an open sweet shop and he bought some bonbons for her.Finally,he had found the present and before the end of the day he ran quickly to his girlfriend's house.If you don't want to pass this situation,you must always do things with time. I like a car as well,but when I have to driving a car I have to think about parking a lot and I can't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am having travel,so the public transport is making connection with human beings.It is why I think public transport is really important for public and there are a lot of important thing is having a possble in the future. For the three reasons mentioned above, I strongly believe that specializing one subject is much more efficient then studying many subjects."	1
36	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"The Reasons That I Like to Visit America

               These days, many travelers have not visited foreign countries because of Covid 19. In my case, I like to travel somewhere with my families or friends. The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots. We were all excited, those from Lala Band minunate.Their voices have positive vibration through their musical and give you a good feeling.On the scene moves very well and know how to take pleasure to the public.I am feeling wonderful and my promise is that when going to have a special occasion to go to a concert supported by Lala Band, you will be with me.As like this in all my heart.I hope as those recounted by me in this mail and you feel a slight vibration from the concert. Most people say that using public transport is better than using cars, and they say that its cheaper and better for the environment, about me I think that cars is easier and affordable way to transport between places, because cars is here any time and so near to your home instead of public transportation which you should take a walk to reach it in most countries, and also cars available all the time, you can go at 4 am and no one say anything, because its yours, but most public transportation is available only for the day hours and few hours at night, in emergency situation for example, what you will do, if you do not have your own car, your kid is sick, or you wife or your old parents, and in general the more we depend on ourselves the more our government able to help the poverty and homeless people out there, who really need more help and aid from the public community, we merely ask the government to improve streets and the traffic light systems, and more oil stations and parking in the streets, to be able to drive and move easy and safe and in a short time. I know that America has popular places like Grand Canyon and Status of Liberty. There are a few people are using puplic transport, like students and someone had low income.in my veiw, i can say might be the puplictransport going to e close because nobody is going to beclose Nevertheless travel by car is easier for commute for example, because they can choose a personal timetable without a terrible discomfort of buses; in addiction there is a fair chance that by the end of this century dwellers will stop travelling by public transport, in special way if the government have invested his money in green energy and we could discover a new green car, which in turn revolutionary our life. I traveled east of America, but I did not happy about I did not visit west of America. ?XD)Cherry blossom is very beautiful but there are so many people.When we went to Sun Moon Lake by cable car,wind is so strong!I felt a little nervous though the scenery amazing.All in all,I stil have a memorable vacation. Egypt have more historical places such as pyramids is the one of empirical in the world and more people from around the wold come to see this pyramids the wold think how Egyptian people make this building from may be thousand year and still stand without change and more tourist come to take photo in the pyramids and study the stone and how the old Egyptian make this one without modern tools such as cranes and other modern machine more scientific teams come from all the world to study this building and make Egyptian science in more universities around the world to study how the air going inside this building and how it keep the food inside it and how this big stone takes out from far places and come for this place and how this building keep the body of the people after died and how this people leave inside the building and why this building like this and what the benefit of this building and how to make kike this building There are a lot of famous universities like Harvard and Cambridge. as a result of this consumer gets more benefit like lower faire, privacy, freedom and safe travelling.in addition many automobile company launcing new car with affordable price which insiost people to use more and more private vechile. Consider both aspects that can be concluded that government should respect the human right and set up a new department which use for people who want to apply to complete the military service. Espesialy there are a lot of greens these makes good health.However someone have to take care of them.The town have to do that and I think in England there are so many greens all around,so a lot of people take care of these that makes good environment.After I have been to live in England with my family I have goton the feel very much indeed. Finally,  I want to make experiences that communicate with foreigners to use English. I learn English when I was in elementary school. However, I did not have the opportunity to communicate with English. It has the limits that I only study in Korea. I heard that I can upgrade my English speaking skills if I talk with foriegners many times. I believe that the people in a future they will begin to travelling shared car more time and they use less the public transport as the train, the bus, underground, etc. America is the country that has a lot of advantages and a things that I have to learn. I want to visit America because I want to feel happiness, learn academy, and practice English. Lastly , workshops about conservation of environment to increase environmental awareness among people to encourage them to take care of their city , and how they can recycle some rubbish to beneficial objects to exploit it at home ."	1

So you go online and learn everything and anything about @LOCATION1. This process involves five main stages.First,it should take some considerations in design,including background colour,artwork,security issues.Next,skilled machinists is prepared ,in which there are metal plates.Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet).Subsequently, the technical must be used specially for distinction,for example the colour printed on both sides,Special ink is used and imges slightly raised.After this,printed sheets will be inspected carefully.According to the quality of sheets,it will be two results.if the quality is good or the bank notes is partially damaged which can be used,it would cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and disoatched.while those bad sheets will be securely destroyed. We can really confirm that there is no future for public transport, if so, we will have to drive a car instead of buying a ticket for public transport and go to office, city, home and so on using private transport, however we can also think that in the centre has no parking car or it is not enough for the whole private car, thereby, if we use a public transport, we can simplify our lives and spend less simply because we are able to save money and time. I have to say that study another language give you more opportunities  because on these days you need to now other language to look for a work and be more inteligent than your college to take the work and that’s great. It also gives you the ability to keep in touch with friends and family, and are necessary for many jobs. Firstly, the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel.Secondly, the public vehicle route are more far than usual route.Thirdly,it is also crowded and no privacy.Finally,there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker. We know so much more about other places now than we did before computers. But computers can teach you so much more than just different countries. Then if you want we could go to the restaurant of the city later if you want we could fiand a job for three months, in my opinion a good job for three months I could be the waiter because the waiter get much money in the three months of the summer. That was me, I never liked studying, I never found myself in those subjects, but it wasn't the big deal to me, I hated is being seen as unsuccessful or a loser, as I wasn't that, I knew that I'm clever enough to study all these subjects and do well in exams so I can get high marks but they're all didn't get that, they judged me for my marks but marks don't form brains or thoughts, marks isn't the only way that makes you great now and then in the future. The internet is a great way to keep in touch with your friends and family. You can use email, instant messaging, video chatting, or you can make an account on websites like facebook or myspace. To my mind our lives has been improved in these years by smarphone, satnav, digital TV, Internet.. Let's suppose a teenager of twenty-first century during the Middle ages.. don't get out alive without Wi-fii! In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life, but majority of ones is totally utopic. When most people hear computers, the first thing that pops into their head is ""internet"". Invention of car has made people's lives easier.No more they have to solely depend on public transport.Though public transport are cheaper and one could get to know many companions ,increase network.But public transport has fixed schedule and on a rushing day not many can really enjoy their journey. I think that any one wants to start sport can play squach which  gives stretched  and  healthy body,in the same time this sport can be played for a long time of period without caring about the age. But now I really enjoyed, and me best friend both for me ticket for a theatre to see the musical show ,which was amazing, for cuople of hours I didn't move, was a brilliant present. According to the problems above mentioned,various approaches that governmentshould be adopted to deal with this problem.first of all,reducing building constructure from now on,planting more trees instead.Sustainadle development should be awaness to all human and start to porteat the environment and preserve the animals. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 jobs require a computer. However if this situation not change and if our government not take providence about this important subject will be the end of the transport public and will more convenient to use car. Computers have changed the world; and once it's changed there's no going back. An day in the morning Paxton waited to Long y the writer, but he listened that called him suddenly he goes for the beach and is killed for the shadow Clearly, computers have become a part of every day life. One day Penny discovered it and it go to tell it to his queen, the queen at knowing that she get very confused but at the same time she get mad and she wanted revenge. But most importantly, you can learn so much!"	1
38	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"Many college students have experiences doing part-time jobs. If you want we could go to the capital city of my country, we will go by the car because the car is cheaper than the bus or train, we could eat in the famous restaurant of the city or we could go to the cinema also if you want I could visit the medieval wall. I think doing part-time jobs is really important for college students. I have confessed that in the first time I didn´t like it very much because I was a bit shy boy and I cost a lot of effort to integrate with the other players of the team but with the passage of the time I liked more and more. I don’t like Narnia, but my favorite movie is probably 22 jump street, Lord of the rings, The tv-show: suits, The walking dead and maybe south park and family guy. I am person that like going to do exercise, for this reason I like practise some sports, but the truth is that my favorite sport all around the world is the soccer.I believe that play soccer is an excellent activity, because in every game that the people can like always has to exist some rules. Third, they make friends with people from different places, which make their college time more interesting and substantial. Nevertheless, college students can't have a part-time job without concentrating on their studies. Although i think that having the experiences of part-time jobs is important, learning by studies is the most important thing for college students. Hey my name is Joe and i´m 21 years old and i´l think i´l would compliment the summer camp very good, because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak. The other matter is about our habit to eating food together with our family that were a custom in humanity life not just in our culture,but now because of hard and busy life ,we had to eat our meal  mostly days of a week. To sum up, college students should first do their best on studies. What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player ,i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families, Experiences of clubs are useful for improving abilities of leadership, and thus helpful for applying jobs after graduating. Nowadays, public transport is used for many people in the cities, we can find different types of them, such as bus tube and train, but is there a future for it or not?, I am going to respond this question giving disadvantanges and advantages and  finally I give my personal opinion."	1
39	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"In my opinion, the importance for college students to have a part-time job varies from individual to individual. my favorite sport is swimming i swim 2 times per a week sometimes i go to the swimming pool in the same area which i work there and sometimes i go to the swimming pool of my cousin, i enjoy when i spend my time in the water and now even i am pregnant i am afraid when i swim with a group of people i keep telling them and screaming do not close with me ! For example, it is important for a college student who is financially strained to have a part-time job if he is able to cope with schoolwork and has time to commit himself to a part-time job. In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life, but majority of ones is totally utopic. I played so good that everyone gave me congratulations but thats not all one of the best team of the world wanted too take me. And to day is necessary because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversation with their you need to now more than your foreign language, because in the rest of the world and particularly in Europe people now more than two language and that great. In conclusin,the whole part of process is an unreversed schedule.It cosumemed the power which contained the humanity and machinic.Nevertheless,in my opinion the most precious of the revolution is the modern security measure through such a muti-developed society. By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we don't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars don't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport. FILM: LUCY (2014) TThe plot of this film is about a 25 naive woman that was living and studying in Taiwan and one night went out for clubbing and met a nutter guy that involved her in a seedy drug smuggling issue with a Corean criminal band that forced her to be a mule drug."	1
40	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Secondly, it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting a time in waiting a specific time to move or even waste a time in waiting a public transportation to reach all point it should get it , but in the other side when  you have your own transport or a private transport is get a right to choose time of trip or when you want to move or stay, and nowadays we cannot waste our time in taking public transport. Sometimes the employers do strike and we clients do not known in time as a result we can not get on time to work,that is one of the disadvantages of using public transport. I want to turn to his hobbies, when he isn't working, he is riding on a bike, every evening he takes the bike and rides across some paths for more than forty kilometers by day, so he is very good rider and its quite strong to ride with him. Computers, in fact, increase our hand-eye coordination. The usage of both the screen and the keyboard allow us to look only at tha sceen while typing on the keyboard. Secondly,tourism,especially in developed countries,has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view.There are countries,such as Greece or Bulgaria,in which the econmoy relies merely on tourism.If tourism influences the econmy,it thereby influnces the environment,and if it influences the environment it influences the transport.How?people become more careful at their historcal sites,this way preserving them;Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale:At a small scale,in cities, in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently.At a large scale,people can now travel in almost any possible way:on land,on sea or air.Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations. For example, the planetarium in a navigate room for learnt about the position of star, four small boats use for practiced the leadership and navigation in Pontevedra  river, or even the simulation for maked the situations which are seldom happen. This is why hand-eye coordination is important to people. When i was arrived at home, i was started to read the news paper, so i found from there The International Student Magazine have to organize a short story competition, and I decide to call Michael to tell him about this contest. This gives us the ability to make millions of searches for any given topic. For example, In fifth grade I did a research project on @LOCATION2. Without all the useful information I found on the computer. Coat of arms of the city of Rybinsk is a scarlet heraldic shield,over which - green with golden beach pier for which the output is black rebelling bear holding in the left leg on the left shoulder golden ax, undertwo silver starlet pain and gain  This movie is bases quote on quote on a ""true story"" buts obviously director michael bay know for the transformers franchise puts a lot of hollywood into this movie, its about a bodybuilder named daniel lugo who decides to kidnap a rich guy and make him sign away all of his properties, which obviously its not a great plan that backfires on him, and eventualy police get him. Then ,the notes will be prepared with metal plates .After that ,printing ,the notes will be printred in colour on  both sides with special ink and it will images sightly raised . Also, if a family is thinking about going somewhere for a vacation, they can take care of most of the help on the computer. Firstly, Django Unchained remembered us the hard life suffered by black people in the past, due to a great introduction without dialogues, where black people were unchained while they came back to be selling to an owner farm, it being matching with an amanzing soundtrack as identity Tarantino´s films. I am from spain so my foreign language is Spanish I start to study another language when I was a child, I started learning English because every one said that English is the future language, when I finished my school time I tried to study French but it was so difficult for me. This is how the computer can help you research any topic. Lastly, you can use the computer to communicate with people that live far away and you rareley ever see. You can see some store fridge around the market for Drinks and Dairy like milk, yogurt, cheese, butter and cream Also chest freezers for Ice creams .In a corner, they sell cosmetics and a salesperson helps customers to find their required . think has a future that all people use public transport then I think that maybe continue to have future but has bad and good things , for example good is easier to move in the city and you save time, and the bad , bad people attack you and steal things, but I thing ,that have future ,because a lot people even they use public transport to. She always tell me some jokes but some times i laughed !,i love her so much,i don't know how will my world being like without her and i won't to know . The creator of the haven and the earth, the creator of soles , the one who make earth rotate around it self and around the sun.What we belief as Muslims that, we have created by one who don't have other with him the one who create our father (Adam ) and created from him (Eve) and they were in the Paradise and instructed to not eat from the tree but the Satan deceive them so they brought to this life and generations came from them and had sent the prophet and messengers ( Moses, Jesus, Mohamed, others.. who they worship the same one) with Miracles and evidence of the truth, to guide the people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to the Paradise and who follow other paths which it will guide to the hell. In conclusion, for me it is a lie that the public transportation has no future, however, they have to make improvements to this like the use of better ways of fuel or energy, one way is using renovable sources of energy such as solar, haeolic (wind) or hidraulic(water),Also there are biodisel, and gasoline extracted from seaweed.And the public transportation will be more important in a few years than now. These are my reasons and I hope you agree with me that computers have a positive effect on people today."	1
41	Government: Some people think that governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology. Other people disagree and think that this money should be spent on more basic needs. Which of these opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"in a car accident , when she her what happened with her brother she was so nervous then the miracle happened she found a big suitcase in the train she decided to open the bag because no one was in the train so she opened the bag she surprised when she saw  a lot of money inside the bag  . It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. Justly, computer science became a trend on scientific approach method. Environmental changes really need in the current situation.People contribuation is very important in this matter.The report explains how my town people taking care of my surroundings and to preserve this planet in a betterway. There are several reasons why goverments should invest considerable money on computer technology field: diversification of computer language, dominance of future quantum computers and its connection with other fields. I don’t like Narnia, but my favorite movie is probably 22 jump street, Lord of the rings, The tv-show: suits, The walking dead and maybe south park and family guy. Sara stood and stared  here for a few minuets and hug here and bowed here for coming  and thanks here they hadn't meet for several years after they have finished their study .Really  it was great moment and stay speaking together about many things and call the best moment that collect them together , stay speaking until the evening .and agreed to visit their collage at the weekend to recall the best memories , peter who is arranged this celebration and connected with Tia and prepared for all this happen Sara never forget that day . The sport is very importatnt of our body it has many benefits to emprove our selves and give us self confedant so we should practice any sport we love because it can change our mind to the better. I used my car every day however few a few I started to take public transport for I can to save up money Furthermore, investing on artificial intelligence which use the big data is also needed. First of all, although travelling by car  become more convenient,   the growing population which cause personal vehicle is hard to manage.The traffic jam  becomes more and more serious as far. Most of physicists, computer scientists forecast that quantum computing will lead scientific community in the fourth industrial revolution era with its distictly fast computing speed. The best season to sale the ice cream from the van is autumn,while that is one of the worst season for indoor swimming pool.The discrepancy of these two place is large.The best sale achievement of the van is 4500,5000,5500respectively. Some claim that spending money on computer technology is less important than investing natural scientific fields; however, recent natural scientific fields have derivative field called, computational sicence. yes, i agree, if you planed the travelling for a long distation and for a long time you would prefer to do it on car, couse firstly you;ll spend less time, you travelling will be comfortable, you'll have a possibility to stop every where and for a long time, as you need. Enhancing computer technology is directly connected with enhancing natural science. Conseqeuntly, investing computer technology field is necessary because"	1

"Dear local newspaper, I have recently saw that you think that people are spending way too much time on computers instead of excercising or hanging with their friends and family. Secondly, it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting a time in waiting a specific time to move or even waste a time in waiting a public transportation to reach all point it should get it , but in the other side when  you have your own transport or a private transport is get a right to choose time of trip or when you want to move or stay, and nowadays we cannot waste our time in taking public transport. People interact with people online if the want to. People can also learn new things. Plus computers help people make money. However we the people have really important part of making it worse.Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh, clean and safe environment to their people.Recycling item can be a good step to start with clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking care by my city.Everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of province government.People is not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere. He seems different, she never imagined that Jason can be like that, she fantasy with someone, brave and strong, and she never foresees something like this, but she feel something for him, maybe she is in love with this guy . Invention of car has made people's lives easier.No more they have to solely depend on public transport.Though public transport are cheaper and one could get to know many companions ,increase network.But public transport has fixed schedule and on a rushing day not many can really enjoy their journey. on any of those sites you interact with people. We can meet new people on the internet. Like people on the other side of the state or country. Also we hear about what is going on in our big or small town. The mas was armed try to steal the backpack.But he not be fixed that the man was a camera in his head and hi action was filmed. I think in the future don't exist public transport because we will drive their car.When you drive your own transport ,a car for example, you going to from a specificlly place but in a bus you go to the bus stop and no to your house or school, work... It is better from the people be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person. For an example, one day I was told do a project on teen mothers. I advise any one dream to be one of the most famous teams that works on hisself a lot & and play football a lot to be profectional in this sport & show a lot of matches &followed by captain supervised on him As every year the twenty three of April, day of book, in my school all the student of fifth and sixth of primary do short story competition and the winner have a gift. Also we can learn about faraway places like @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1. It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. Life is unpredictable and unforseen.The immense possibilities of life  give us opportunity to explore life but some times   it lead to threat and dangers to our life.We surely pray for the best life of our dear and near ones.But insurance is also necessity and invetable for peace of mind .It gives us surety to live life securely.It just not only to save our life but also secure assets like houses cars etc. Some were good, nice, big houses but tyen others lived in boxes and trash cans. That changed me big time, I felt really had for those people. Most illiterate people choose their proficiency as  public  transportations like ,bus service, cab service, auto service....etc, in order to full fill their basic needs.People with more  unemployment may also lead to a crime rate . It was a cold day at night when I was at home watching my favourite programme on my telly called ""dare to win"", I was with my brother, when we decided to call, The programme is about questions for the contestants that must be answer in correct time, and there is a different things for the winner. Theycan go to websites to find good safe jobs that makes good money. at last I wanna talk about my cousins , I love the most of them especially the cousin in the same age , they are my friends , i love too much ,and also the rest of my family The diabetes is the increasing  of the glucosa in the blood, The have two types, first the Diabetes Type 1 that is predent in childrens, pacient needs insuline every day, also this diabetes is caused by the destruction of the insuline realized by the person´s immuny siste. For all the people I advise to start to play or watching football because for me it is a very good sport , but you can play a good football only if you really like it , because first football is fun . We have Eather first than people thanour house.Eather is our home,we all have to protect it.But now people are distroy it.Just for mony for more house but if we destroy it we will all die our money will gone our house will gone we will have nothing.Beside some people destroy farland to build houses but if one day there is no farmland than what should we eat?Nothing at that time we can eat nothing!So what should we do? Therefore computers are good. Does why, is easy to believe that if things continue with this rhythm and transforming everything, in a closer future of 50 years everything is gonna be completely knew and different. Do you use computers for any of these reasons?"	1

"For some reasons, I really liked to play basketball, first, playing basketball can train my muscle and make the body more healthier ; the second, my classmates and I all know how to win a game through the basketball game because the basketball game is a teamwork. One piece of equptment that is affecting peoples lives, is the computer. While I were in ANDRAPRADESH every year we have Christmas function in December although we are not interested to attend Drama they were not leave us without participation even simple character.They gave me a character like THE GOD .Firstly I never aware about how act and do this particular character.And from October to till December we practise everyday after our study hour up to eleven ""O""CLOCK.DAY BY DAY  I learn and finally I did my role well.Then I think myself why I wasted all my school days . However, public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a new car and for the adventurer who want to have an exciting travel for then to see more action.Like watching outside or sight seeing,to mingle and meet different people.In addition to this I also admire the bullet train in japan which u consider fast and safe public vehicle Ive'd known. I studied in Kuwait schools , after that I joined Damascus university , the faculty of human medicine , I graduated from it in 2008 with very good grade , then I got the Master's degree in laboratory medicine from the same university (Ministry of Higher Education ) in 2013 with Excellent grade .

Nature is as beautiful as a gorgeous scene of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 love oceans with pink sand. Who would want to miss this? @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 complain that they rarely enjoy what life has to take on the outside of your house. for example,using wind Energy or Solar Energy for electricity generation we will be used less fuel what is affected in emissions. ""I want my @CAPS6, to experience the wide variety of nature as she grows old."" @CAPS5 of her daughter. Well, @MONTH1 I add, little @CAPS6 is not going to get much nature out of her, if she does not get her eyes unglued to the comuter screen! Most of the organizations known how is affect managemant acountant practice on them work , therefore they are chossing good programme and employee. @PERCENT2 of all the population in the @LOCATION2 is overweight due to technology brought into our world. although traveling by car is really interesting but still using public transport has its advantages ,by using public transport you're saving  effort when  driving a car for along distance you will get tired , some people don't have enough money to buy their own car . high-paid physicians try and teach their parents at a young age, to go out and play sports - while excersing at the same time and nor to stay home and play videogames. First,the bank notes are designed by consider,thinking from background colour,artwork,security issues.Then,the metal plates are preparated by skilled machinists.And then, the sheets are printed,operator should pay attention to the colour on both sides,special ink,and images slightly raised.

The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots. We can change  everything hurt us if we need if we have volition The reasons for  stress are more diverse perhaps because  we have an  exam period,  family proplems or because we think in negative way,  or we destroyed  ourselves  in long hours of working and canceld our needs  for enough comfortable,  and  lots of reasons to stress...   We must get  out of  the stress quickly before  lose ourself because it's very hurtful period, for example you can read a  book,  doing sport,  play music,  eating delicious food, remmeber  all the positive thing was took place with you,  talk about someone who trust for him,  take off every thing make you upset and make you life tiring,  go out and eat meal with your best joking friends,  and  there a lot of you have to do...   Remmeber the stress is not  lasting thing,  and you can avoid  it  But if you  are willing  to live in happy life.

There is not so much traffic, and my senses and lounges perceive and respire all the smell that flowers,  land, the First, I walk slowly and then I begin to walk as soon as possible to improve my fitness and I end walking 5 turns in the park. In the public transport you don't have your own sit so sometimes you travel standing which is not very comfortable and in winter you don't have air conditioning so if it's cold in the outside it's cold inside the transport to, sometimes you have to travel with sick people that can transmit you the illness. Do you agree that computers take over lives? The biggest anecdote, that I have with my friend, was our trip to Disney world.Where we could visit all the parks of Disney , like Animal Kingdom ,Hollywood studios and Magic kingdom.In adittion we could visit others parks, like Universal and Bush Garden."	1

Fdi can play important role in it.It give competition to national companies .By virtue of which they  work properly mannerly and give better option to policy holders.people can always buy nominal premium we should aware them about the types of insurance as well as benefits of the insurancce. Computers allo people to talk online with each other. Football is my favorite sports In my life.so,I pay more attention to it than any other things you might think of.I had been following series of football's events in and around the world at large.I took this time to command people who are sacrificing their entire life of the betterment of sportsmanship.With all that,I do have my favorite club team n country as well.And also have my favorite players,Ronaldinho,Messi and Eto'o.My favorite club is Barcelona and country is Cameroon although that I am from Liberia.I know football doesn't go by sentiments but the love of choice and what desire you the best.What really makes me to love Barcelona is that they play the football,instead of them running around.They always bring talented players that will make the club be more improved tactically.people always say this;""Barcelona doesn't buy players""it's not like,they are lacking money.We do essential purchasing of players to save more money.You have to save money for players to enable you to pay them on time.As normal humanbeings,you have to know how to spend money,where,when to spend it.it's not because you have more money then you lavish it.So,i love my team and my staff and how they run things in my team.The facts should not be hidden Barcelona is the best club team in the world,you like or not. Computers also allow people to store important files and pictures in places that won't get lost. Computers are helpful in so many ways, but these are just a few. Computers allow people online.

45	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? you must think a little bit before you talk as  one word causes a lot of pain for others for the rest they lives .you may not  actually notice that but you  will feel what am really mean if  someone tells you a painful words . although traveling by car is really interesting but still using public transport has its advantages ,by using public transport you're saving  effort when  driving a car for along distance you will get tired , some people don't have enough money to buy their own car . It is widely accepted that smoking does harm to our health. Smoking can increase the possibility of catching some cancers. You can visit old city and watch old buildings and castel,you can watch the beautiful view from bridges over the water.Young people may like to take a walk in king garden,there is sakura trees.If you like night life you can go to some bars and night clubs that are open till morning.But there are two places that i meant in the beggining,its a big zoo called Kolmorden and biggest aquapark in Scandinavia that called Rusha. What's more, smoking influences not only the health of smokers, but also the second-hand smokers'. Secondly,tourism,especially in developed countries,has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view.There are countries,such as Greece or Bulgaria,in which the econmoy relies merely on tourism.If tourism influences the econmy,it thereby influnces the environment,and if it influences the environment it influences the transport.How?people become more careful at their historcal sites,this way preserving them;Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale:At a small scale,in cities, in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently.At a large scale,people can now travel in almost any possible way:on land,on sea or air.Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations. In this way, it is a quite reasonable rule that all the customers should obey. To ban smoking in restaurants can also help educate the teenagers. As we all know, the number of teenagers who smoke is rising rapidly. This process involves five main stages.First,it should take some considerations in design,including background colour,artwork,security issues.Next,skilled machinists is prepared ,in which there are metal plates.Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet).Subsequently, the technical must be used specially for distinction,for example the colour printed on both sides,Special ink is used and imges slightly raised.After this,printed sheets will be inspected carefully.According to the quality of sheets,it will be two results.if the quality is good or the bank notes is partially damaged which can be used,it would cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and disoatched.while those bad sheets will be securely destroyed. My name is shousheng and live in Montreal Canada.Alrough Canada is an English country however in Montreal, the offical language is Freach. The customers may feel uncomfortable and uneasy when exposed to the smoke in the restaurants. The future for the public transport shouldn't be  taken lightly,  in my opinion, the public transport is the best option for ending the problems with the traffic jam because when we use a bus or subway , a lot of people is travelling from one place at other in only one transport or vehicle. This major involves all, always we have to consider the all possibilities to resolve  homework , you have to know the most possible information for can resolve it. Given these reasons, we can now draw a conclusion that the ban on smoking at all the restaurants is reasonable and necessary."	1
46	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Good day, My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport, Volleyball one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to practise  this sport 3 times a week since 1980,  the reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as follows : 1- make me fit and healthy  2- classy game no friction between players  3- it exercise all muscles of your body Regarding the above I advice all rookies to start practise this sport and they will get many benefits. for example,using wind Energy or Solar Energy for electricity generation we will be used less fuel what is affected in emissions. one day Micheal wanted to go out from his home so he called his besfriend an suggested to go out togther , his friend agreed , so Michael weared his closes , wnet out and closed the door but at this moment he knew he had made a mistake . As every year the twenty three of April, day of book, in my school all the student of fifth and sixth of primary do short story competition and the winner have a gift. We separated paper from glass and also to plastic.The garbage picks up paper once a week,plastic two times at month and undiferretiated three times a week to all people who live in my country.My district makes clean my village and it usually tries to make attractive with new social initiatives for the community. I have to say that study another language give you more opportunities  because on these days you need to now other language to look for a work and be more inteligent than your college to take the work and that’s great. We can change  everything hurt us if we need if we have volition The reasons for  stress are more diverse perhaps because  we have an  exam period,  family proplems or because we think in negative way,  or we destroyed  ourselves  in long hours of working and canceld our needs  for enough comfortable,  and  lots of reasons to stress...   We must get  out of  the stress quickly before  lose ourself because it's very hurtful period, for example you can read a  book,  doing sport,  play music,  eating delicious food, remmeber  all the positive thing was took place with you,  talk about someone who trust for him,  take off every thing make you upset and make you life tiring,  go out and eat meal with your best joking friends,  and  there a lot of you have to do...   Remmeber the stress is not  lasting thing,  and you can avoid  it  But if you  are willing  to live in happy life. he said kindly:""I buy you a present,open it,Tom"" Tom opened the big bag,Oh!This is a big surprise,there was a football in it,which he always wanted to buy there were some words goal!keep doing! Transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible Second, these days, many researchers conduct studies which are mixed area research. first my favorite sport is futboll and i like for many reasons for example while you are watching a match you´re going to feel exited and entretaining besides that fubol has the best fotboll player than ever who is leo mesy he's the best and he s able to awesome stuff when he´s playing. Traditional biologists may study with biological or chemical processes; in contrast, current ones do so with other area's technologies. Therefore, considering the current research trends, it is good for students to learn various fields, and for universities to give students various courses in order to make competent researchers. But she is boyfriend live upstate and hasn’t got a airport he’s of city because of that she was need choose by train. However, I still believe that large background knowledge is better than deep one. Taking many courses must be take times and energy, but this is not a waste, rather it is investment. i like volei because it was part of my life and of life of my mother, is my favorite sport, but i like over sports too, same i don't play volei because I'm bad, and my friends that know, don't like of  peoples bad of volei.I'm watching they playing, they're really very good, but when play over school, they're very bad after two days poleas sow some boody in crime scene the poles man ask them what did you do hear ? Thus, it is good to study various fields for future achievement. In conclusion, considering the factors above, it is easy to say that taking many courses has many benefits. Some public transports  as trains do not contaminate as cars or motorbikes.Many people said that public transport is not confortable, thats true, from my point of view bus is not so unconfortable. In other words, spending times to look around various fields can not be a large risk in their life. Students still have to enjoy the chance to be bore ambitious."	1
47	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Computers, @CAPS1 how far we've come. Sometimes, some tv shows are so great that helps you in determinate class,for example, Animal Plante can help you in biology, The History can help in history, etc... In my opinion the television can be good as books, and can also be a form of learning as good as only reads books, because TV is something fun, so you can learn and have fun at the same time. Peter drove his car to the doctor's clinic and after half an hour he arrived and he and his grandmother go above through the stairs to reach the doctor's clinic after they arrived they found that they have to stay aperiod of time to take his turn they waited and then their turn came .they entered the doctor and the doctor was very kind he welcomed them and after check    peter's grandmother. Computers fasinate many and can become very adicting if not used only in moderation. Further to the trade fair of the last week where we were a pleasure to meet you and we were talking about you courses. Imagine seven years of your life sitting in front of a computer. as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! You even decide to cut the sports from your life. Now imagine what that does to your body. Even if you ate right, the never excersising part woudl kill you. I remember I was at my cousin @PERSON2's house when she sugested to play the game @CAPS2 fit. If you have never played this before, when you sign in, it does some tests and determines the age of your body. My body was @NUM1 years old. I don´t have friends who like swimming, almost like football or similar teams sports, and always I go alone it isn´t boring for me furthermore, I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I haven´t wait anybody. All those years gone in front of the computer. I don't want that experience to happen to anouther. when you have desire to do something, somehing you always dream to achieve it , something is touch you inside when not only do it but also when think about. finally ,a public transport need more costs , because public transport (such a buses , train ) fees every year is increasing, and this problem we do not face it by private transport , You can see some store fridge around the market for Drinks and Dairy like milk, yogurt, cheese, butter and cream Also chest freezers for Ice creams .In a corner, they sell cosmetics and a salesperson helps customers to find their required . We separated paper from glass and also to plastic.The garbage picks up paper once a week,plastic two times at month and undiferretiated three times a week to all people who live in my country.My district makes clean my village and it usually tries to make attractive with new social initiatives for the community. Its  popularity spreads all over world too.There are many reasons behind it to be popular.Everyone is able to enjoy the excitement throughout of this game the session.The people who eager to play football must follow some basic rules which are described below: 1.A football player should be punctual and hard-working. I hated seeing my friend like this, but mostly I hated how I watched it happen. I decided and went.It was strange because I never went to the sports.From the time I started going to karate.After one month my instructor told me that I will go to the competition.I was very worrying and nervous. She enjoyed a certain website on the internet. It would sometimes get scary when she talked to me about it and clearly had played it all night. If you are looking at this story and thinking that would never happen to me, your wrong. I was thinking the same way when I took a look at that website that got her started. But, on the other hand, because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable; cars are so many; very noisy, unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth. In order to reuse, I convert all thing reusable,for example,plastic bottle as a plant pot; glass bottle as a food container;I bring my reusable shopping bag and refuse to use a shopping plastic if a salemen offer me to bring. @CAPS3!... secondly these mode of transportation covers      as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routine who travelled by public transportation.as a consquence generally people avoid travelling by public transportation finally i can say that there are various mode of transporotation avaliable  to competition with public transportation. That is the sound of your family members trying to talk to you when your on the computer. we will know today some of information about Islam , Islam is great religion come from The Arabian Peninsula and its founded since 1436 years ago. My mom does this many times a day to grab my attention and ends up calling my cell phone or I.ming me. Thats really just sad. By doing this you also become detatched which is never a good thing. This experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister (I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money. Computers truly are amazing, but the loss of excersise is very unhealthy and rapidly happening. Computers can also be dangerous, many people will get addicted. There are many sports grounds for example tennis cort,football grounds and play equipment for child so I think my town takes care of environment that makes everyone will be able to best condition in both mind and body long time. You can see some store fridge around the market for Drinks and Dairy like milk, yogurt, cheese, butter and cream Also chest freezers for Ice creams .In a corner, they sell cosmetics and a salesperson helps customers to find their required . so, on my opinion, even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers Suddenly we heard the sound of running footsteps.Then there was a cry and the footsteps stopped.Nervously,we walked back.Perhaps someone had been killed,or kidnapped in the street We were going to see what happened ,and we had something to see.There was one old granny who was beat up.We try to gave her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that.Than we were trying to find help ,but nobody was opening doors.On our luck I had a mobile phone ,but Michael was saying that we need to escape because we did not know are those bullies near the corner.My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I've done that."	1

"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 a society we have come very for regarding advancements and inventions. now days, there are many type of transport in the world ,bus taxi,train but train more conform then else , I always used bus in city. This piece of technology has so many benefits and positive effects on people that without it, everyone would be stupefied. For exomple, this device allows people to keep in touch using a common social network. In addition, specially designed computers can tend to peoples specific needs. while we are spendind good time watching TV our brain is not in calm, only in an other position different to that ones in the rest od the day.That's why I think that it's a good momento to see the thing through a new glass and that can be a very high opportunity. We're looking for a new nice home and so we are truly interested to keep your place tide and take care about it as it were our own. Just think of all the people you've emailed or instant messaged in the past week... Dear all I Am communicating to you, with the purpose of let yo know that we will set up a meeting at  my office with the purpose of discuss how we  could use social media to improve the Communication with our suplliers, i think a great time for the meeting could be next Monday at 4:00 p.m Kind regards Armando Martínez The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots. Ferrari making one of the fastes cars on the word, but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac, how they were in the past.If sameone like cars then should go to Formula 1 race to hear the bolid engine sound, I think that is the best voice which I have ever heard in my life.Formula 1 it is also  dangerous sport, the driver are exposed to the risk of  accident at high speed. the movie I´m going to be reviewing is ""the purge""  I actually loved it quite a lot, I just loved all the suspense and the parts they leave you hanging, it´s just way too interesting, the movie is about the american government who annually gives 12 hours where all crime, even murder, is legal, and there are no medical services during that long period of what they call ""the purge"" and anyone can join it, you can kill whoever you want. When he was just about cursing the final line he got hurt and his mussels was dying and star to peel off a black matter, at that point the guys in suit thought that he won’t be able to cross the line , but when they saw that he kept running, they freeze the time and run after him, he stopped for a moment but then , he start running again and when he cross the line he woke up in a red somber fluid, he was wiped out from the matrix, he opened his eyes and saw a flying robot, suddenly he was on a wood wheelchair and they said that he would never be able to walk again , besides that, he stands up and tried to walk again. However, computers also provide surfaces for those with medical needs. I am person that like going to do exercise, for this reason I like practise some sports, but the truth is that my favorite sport all around the world is the soccer.I believe that play soccer is an excellent activity, because in every game that the people can like always has to exist some rules. @PERCENT1 of hospitals nationwide say that computers are on essential in their facilities. Most people say that using public transport is better than using cars, and they say that its cheaper and better for the environment, about me I think that cars is easier and affordable way to transport between places, because cars is here any time and so near to your home instead of public transportation which you should take a walk to reach it in most countries, and also cars available all the time, you can go at 4 am and no one say anything, because its yours, but most public transportation is available only for the day hours and few hours at night, in emergency situation for example, what you will do, if you do not have your own car, your kid is sick, or you wife or your old parents, and in general the more we depend on ourselves the more our government able to help the poverty and homeless people out there, who really need more help and aid from the public community, we merely ask the government to improve streets and the traffic light systems, and more oil stations and parking in the streets, to be able to drive and move easy and safe and in a short time. She turned her haid and saw him ""he was fowling me"" she thought""well,I should ask him what are he doing here"" ""What are you doing here"" ask Alison he looks her but with a bad smile,and turn his head Besides, it’s also an environment problem, exhaust fumes engulfed the earth, more car is used, more exhaust gas release, we are killing our mother. As every year the twenty three of April, day of book, in my school all the student of fifth and sixth of primary do short story competition and the winner have a gift. Lastly, computers can expand one's knowledge. I am person that like going to do exercise, for this reason I like practise some sports, but the truth is that my favorite sport all around the world is the soccer.I believe that play soccer is an excellent activity, because in every game that the people can like always has to exist some rules. my father  my father name is Zaheer arat.he is very loving and caring.they gives us all the facilities one should have and dream of these things.he provides all the facilities to us of internet and books so that we can learn better and can be good students and get good marks in the examination.he always encouraged us and said don't afraid of anything because you are braver than anything else.my brothers and me proud of my father.he is very hard working and brave.he has the smiley face.he always tries to laugh other people with their jokes.he always listens to us what we want.he never ever ignore us. You're fully prepared for your vacation now because of your computer. Also, in my life, my teachers assign @CAPS1 research papers requiring us to find information on a topic. Perhaps going the library isn't an option, how are you going to acquire the information? I love my small family.My family members are very helpful and supportive.My parents are very support.My parents are my best friends and guides.If any problems faced ,i'm went to my parents and say the problem,there are solve the problem.My family is my world.My parents are the good guides.There are my role model.some times we were go to the tour programs,it's very happy moments.My mammy told the story in night.Mom make the special foods in festivals. Internent research is the top way amongst all colleges and universities to research. I was recently assigned a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 project by my social studies teacher, @PERSON1 where we got to choose my topic of community service and research it. Every student in my class used the computer in some way, shape, or form for their project. Thus, computers can allow you to get information efficiently. One day Penny discovered it and it go to tell it to his queen, the queen at knowing that she get very confused but at the same time she get mad and she wanted revenge. One day Penny discovered it and it go to tell it to his queen, the queen at knowing that she get very confused but at the same time she get mad and she wanted revenge. Henceforth, I believe that computers serve @CAPS1 a positive advancement in technology and its effect on people are rather great."	1

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, With computers being so popular right now it's easy to think that they are helpful and have a positive effect on the people that use them. You should knew about the prize for coming to the museum is very cheap ($15.00) for hour if you want to stay more time the prize increase in $10.00. I belive this for @NUM1 reasons. One, they take away from spending time with real people, they make people get less excersis, and also they are very distracting and waste time. In the future,people will go out of the Earth .Because of the damage,people on the ground can't survive.When they want to find foods,there will be nothing.Even of the grass can't alive on earth.Thought,but most people do not be the member of the team of alive.Cause of lots of damage,but they didn't Take responsibility.I wonder for sixteen years.And I don't know if they were change their mind in after the next fifty years. Now and day people are using social networking sites like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 to talk with people far away. People can spend hours communication with someone they will never meet and completly ignore the people who care for and love them. Also communication with people online can be dangerous because the person who you are messaging might not be who they say they are. Overall, setting out and actually spending time with real people creates memories that you will cherish for the rest of your life. This feeling can never occur through the internet. Another reason why I think that computers have a bad effect on their users is that constant computer use has resulted in a lack of excersise for many people. But, in this moment the people think different, is to start to help the world and  Contamination is big problem for us and the planet. we all know that do sport is very important to keep our life healthy and happy.My favourite sport actually is walking;and I prefer walking in the morning and before sundown.I like also walking in public street,gardens,clubs and on the shore.when i want to go anywhere;I do my best to go on foot.I like this sport since my childhood because I found that I can think about my good time when I was child and relax with myself to think carefully about my present and future.The walking can also fitness and do the knee stronger.It would be interesting to accompain your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time.I advice my guys who suffer from laziness and overweight,try to walk one hour at least and after that they will like this sport. The only movement that occurs while on a computer is the tiny flick of a finger as it clicks the mouse button. This is clearly not enough excersise that is required to maintain a healthy and happy lifestyle. Studies have shown that since the invention of computers young people especially have been gretting less and less physical activity. Firstly,the growing number of private cars cause the big problem with traffic jam .People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam.That wastes people's time and make people feel exhausted.Not mention to say,it's definitely hard to enjoy travelling in holidays.Secondly,private  cars are the main reason for the air pollution.We should consider the protection of environment for human future,not only care about the convenience we can see for now. In old times luxuries were not considered as compare to Heslth but now every one prefer to save time and maintain privacy which one can only afford by using her/his private transport so gradually public transport losing its charm. Looking for any sport make you feel good and your brain be always refresh so that you  can begin your day with any sport to making fresh and after that you can make any job with refreshment mind. When I clicked on it I was brought to a site full of funny stories and pictures. I choose the wheel because is the most useful invention ever because thanks to it the human works make easier by example a way to move heavy objects, compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today the wheel was invented at a relatively late point of human history, he oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia. I like a car as well,but when I have to driving a car I have to think about parking a lot and I can't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am having travel,so the public transport is making connection with human beings.It is why I think public transport is really important for public and there are a lot of important thing is having a possble in the future. I'm sure I would have gotten if I had not been distracted other things to do on the computer. we all know that do sport is very important to keep our life healthy and happy.My favourite sport actually is walking;and I prefer walking in the morning and before sundown.I like also walking in public street,gardens,clubs and on the shore.when i want to go anywhere;I do my best to go on foot.I like this sport since my childhood because I found that I can think about my good time when I was child and relax with myself to think carefully about my present and future.The walking can also fitness and do the knee stronger.It would be interesting to accompain your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time.I advice my guys who suffer from laziness and overweight,try to walk one hour at least and after that they will like this sport. cell phone I chose this invention that I think that helped to humanity to communicate more easily,  Motorola It was the first doing something to a mobile phone  was on 3 April 1973 the first to do so was an employee of Martin Cooper Cooper made mobile phone history in April 1973 when he made the first ever call on a handheld mobile phone After that, with the new technology they could invent new and better dispositives for the needs of users  ""taken from https://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/guides/history-of-mobile-phones/"" Is summary,people taken many intiative steps and moving forward to have safe and attracticve eniroment surrondings."	1
50	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"most of girl doesnt like this,i think that it takes us energy,we need to do exercise,reasonable diet...and so on. I like to play football cause for me, as well as one hobby, is one way to stand out of the world, of the problem that every day I have to face, and at the end it makes me calm and happy. Apart from that you see new places and you have fun, you also lern others cultures, historicals facts, you also lern to respect others peoples and thirs costums. There are three main reasons as to why I feel 'offensive' pieces of writing, movies, and music should be allowed in public libraries. One reason as to why they should not is that people have been writing and expressing themselves throughout history; therefor, there are far too many pieces that we would have to get rid of in order to eliminate them all. On the rest of the boring week, I was watching TV and suddenly my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet, so I decided to solve my Paris puzzles with my sister, which was less than a half solved for about one year but it had too much color in the sky so I didn't finished then a year ago. The third reason that will be elaborated on is that people will be exposed to whatever it is you try to hide, if not throught the art of music, movies, or books, then through the real world we live in. In the public transport you don't have your own sit so sometimes you travel standing which is not very comfortable and in winter you don't have air conditioning so if it's cold in the outside it's cold inside the transport to, sometimes you have to travel with sick people that can transmit you the illness. my town tries all the time to make our town more beautiful and comfortable by taking more care of the environment,they provide us by good buses which are friends to the environment and offer the tickets for this buses in a cheap price,they also trying to find the best way to make the rubbish more useful by the recycling,also the people tries all the time to find the best way for keep our village clean;they never throw the rubbish in the streets or the gardens,also they take care of the fuel in their cars to not to be bad for the environment,so,it's our duty to take care of our village and the whole environment beside the government. This experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister (I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money. In almost every form of art there is some remark to something negative. squash sport also can be played individually as two players together or in team of 4 players.squash one of the very nice attractive sports In the reconquest age the stronghold never downfall with a direct assault, finally the Castellan's army after a large siege force to the government surrender it. For example, I was going on a band trip with all the other band students, and on the way there we put on a movie. First of all,swim can help your health.The research declined that swim can decrease disease.Second,swim can relax yourself.When you in the water,you will feel relax.Third,swim can get more friend.You can go to the swimming club,that is a way to meet people with interesting of same.You can try this sport from now on. We can really confirm that there is no future for public transport, if so, we will have to drive a car instead of buying a ticket for public transport and go to office, city, home and so on using private transport, however we can also think that in the centre has no parking car or it is not enough for the whole private car, thereby, if we use a public transport, we can simplify our lives and spend less simply because we are able to save money and time. Firstly, staff and Personnel design the background colour , the artwork and the scuriity issues on the bank notes,which is also  done in process of other card,such as notes for supermarket.Then in the preparation process, skilled machinists prepare of metal plates for printing.After that sheets of bank notes are printed,there are differences and specials for it, it use special ink ,and print colors on both side,images are slightly rised. It all depends on personal views as to it being 'offensive' or not. The third reason is that poeple will expierence all of the things you are trying to hide. I suggested to other people  first to understand yourself such as  what do you like, which is possible and than practice after every success But in some country, You can use underground (metro) , it is very advanced than old types like Bus or Taxi,The underground is faster and clean and arranged . For example, people want to take out a book called, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' because it uses the word 'nigger' in the story quite a few times. There are a lot of people that feel it is not appropriate enough to be taught in school. On top of that, they want to get rid of all the books that say 'nigger' and replace them with books that say 'slave' instead. This process involves five main stages.First,it should take some considerations in design,including background colour,artwork,security issues.Next,skilled machinists is prepared ,in which there are metal plates.Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet).Subsequently, the technical must be used specially for distinction,for example the colour printed on both sides,Special ink is used and imges slightly raised.After this,printed sheets will be inspected carefully.According to the quality of sheets,it will be two results.if the quality is good or the bank notes is partially damaged which can be used,it would cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and disoatched.while those bad sheets will be securely destroyed. In the book when they use the word it is very powerful and makes you think. If you replace it with 'slave' that statement or passage loses its power on its readers. What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player ,i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families, If it does happen, we would be deleting part of our history and knowledge. With that if we do it, how will we know what books to take out, if everyone has a different opinion on what is 'offensive' and what is not. Finally, should we do this, it will not solve anything. When he was just about cursing the final line he got hurt and his mussels was dying and star to peel off a black matter, at that point the guys in suit thought that he won’t be able to cross the line , but when they saw that he kept running, they freeze the time and run after him, he stopped for a moment but then , he start running again and when he cross the line he woke up in a red somber fluid, he was wiped out from the matrix, he opened his eyes and saw a flying robot, suddenly he was on a wood wheelchair and they said that he would never be able to walk again , besides that, he stands up and tried to walk again. In other way, I never be a witness , what I have to do?, tell me what cain of suit have the witnees have to wear, If I have to buyany colour of tie, the flower.... really I'm very exciting with your wedding. looking at the information in more detail.Initially,bank note should be considered the design such as background colour ,artwork,and security issues.then,the preparation of metal plates is next stage.bank note should be skilled and machinists.thereafter,this stage is printing .worker should pay attention to colour on both sides,special ink , and images slightly raised."	1
51	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"Yes it is important to have a part time job. So my idea is aii the coutries allthe people stop to use farmland,forest andwetlang to build houses grow more trees portect our world,our homestar! In England where I live, in Bedford, we use a lot the train to go in the most important town of UK, but the train are very expensive, me and my family stay careful if we go off pick because the price are to high. At first, I had called a travel agent but he said he couldn’t be able to book me a flight before two months, so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent. This benefits the person for the entirety of his life, and so it is always better to start early. College students are at the point of their lives where they are the most malleable in terms of their psychological outlook, so having them undergo some life lessons will definitely allow them to benefit for the rest of their life. The island was flood but the island had a levee that prevent a flooding then in many year a engineers star constructing a building to had more money then in the city put many advertising in all thing : ball, balloon, movies ,etc. Sometimes the employers do strike and we clients do not known in time as a result we can not get on time to work,that is one of the disadvantages of using public transport. One can also learn more skills on the job, and gain valuable contacts that can put him/her in good stead in future job hirings. In my opinion, some are born with a silver spoon, and will never work part time. These are people who will never gain an appreciation for life."	1
52	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @LOCATION1, I think computers are a great tool for everyone if they use it right. Michael decided to open the door and back for her, he thought better the things he do not want to leave her again, he like her, he knows himself and he wants to know her, he have kept all his feelings for a long time. I choose the wheel because is the most useful invention ever because thanks to it the human works make easier by example a way to move heavy objects, compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today the wheel was invented at a relatively late point of human history, he oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia. Using the internet, world changing news can spread like wildfire and inform everyone in seconds. It is great for staying in the loop and reading about things you need to know. You can visit old city and watch old buildings and castel,you can watch the beautiful view from bridges over the water.Young people may like to take a walk in king garden,there is sakura trees.If you like night life you can go to some bars and night clubs that are open till morning.But there are two places that i meant in the beggining,its a big zoo called Kolmorden and biggest aquapark in Scandinavia that called Rusha. Yes,I think it also can educate.As times go by,technology is rapidly improving.More and more gadgets are invented such as televisions,smartphones and so on.There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly.Using will not only gain the entertainment but also get the knowledge.For instance,there are numerous program that we can choose.It is a good time to turn to the entertaining program,when we feel bored and gaze the wall all the day.Television provides educated varieties of channels as well.Discovery channel is posture-oriented model example to educate.We can learn how do the different animals feed on themselves.Above the statements can ensure a rich and abundant live. This brought mass attention to @LOCATION2 which caused many people to donate and needed items. Secondly, the computer is also good for researching topics for school and common interest. If you need facts for a school project you can easily search what you need through the internet wide variety of search engines, you will be able to pin-point exactly what you are also look up things that interest you. for example, lunch time travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emission of carbon mono oxide which is effected to red blood cells and irritate to breathing system. Secondly,tourism,especially in developed countries,has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view.There are countries,such as Greece or Bulgaria,in which the econmoy relies merely on tourism.If tourism influences the econmy,it thereby influnces the environment,and if it influences the environment it influences the transport.How?people become more careful at their historcal sites,this way preserving them;Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale:At a small scale,in cities, in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently.At a large scale,people can now travel in almost any possible way:on land,on sea or air.Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations. In our earth, Hunderds of millions prople living in here.Except us, There are also a large number of wildlife. my town tries all the time to make our town more beautiful and comfortable by taking more care of the environment,they provide us by good buses which are friends to the environment and offer the tickets for this buses in a cheap price,they also trying to find the best way to make the rubbish more useful by the recycling,also the people tries all the time to find the best way for keep our village clean;they never throw the rubbish in the streets or the gardens,also they take care of the fuel in their cars to not to be bad for the environment,so,it's our duty to take care of our village and the whole environment beside the government. Another example of why lives are gonna changed completely in 50 years is because also that connection between others cultures make People concern more about her own health, the expectations of life and the way they want to live it, because everyday will be easier to see how much are we hearting the earth so we will see faster the impacts that this brings to our life. Using social networking sites like facebook and myspace, you can connect with your friends and chat with them for hours on end.

Just like how I talk to people about a band we both love. I believe access to news, research, and staying in touch with your friends is without a doubt the best reasons to use a computer. the actions of this film took place in Alexandrie city of Egypt and it talks about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they didn't have much money to produce their own albums , that sort of bands is   famous between the youth and they call it ""under ground bands "" .their songs give a big concenet to the political and social stituation in Egypt and they become famous after the25 january revoulation , why I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society , there is no chance for the youth and if they found it , they face lot of problems to save it and they didn't find time for other activties and in sometimes they worked in thing which  they never learn or love One of the example is television, in the past we use it only for watching news and movie, but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t, now television has others function."	1

"Dear Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. The social networks such as: Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,Google plus... are connecting  us to more and more friends, companies, public figures, books, films, social organizations...we are really have many things to see, to think, to ""like"", to ""comment"" and a dozen of stuffs that we can make an action to interactive with others...so may it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves, to take care our healthy. Because you are the best teacher in the whole world!many of our class classmate really like you too!We know that you are going to teach  Discovery-bay  primary school .My English result is  better once  you taught me I really love you, Ms Cumings!your friend Ms Decock told me that  she is going to Australia ,and I love you two both I hope you that you will come back some times !

A report in @ORGANIZATION1 stated that @PERCENT1 of fortune @NUM2 companies are run soley by computer programs. @ORGANIZATION1 also state that the other @PERCENT2 of fortune @NUM2 companies plan to switch to computer based operations by the end of @DATE2. The island was flood but the island had a levee that prevent a flooding then in many year a engineers star constructing a building to had more money then in the city put many advertising in all thing : ball, balloon, movies ,etc. Computers make life easier in general and can help with all life throws at you. First, computer teach hand-eye coordination and can improve reflexes and reaction time. Computer based video games can prepare you for real life tasks and challenges by improving your physical skills. Numerous flight simulators and driving simulators are available on the consumer market. then when I have time and I see a senior citizen in the street  introducing their scraps bag in an wrong bank I explain them who they have to recycle and who important it is for our environment carefully recycle it Some driving schools even make their students learn to drive in a simulator before hitting the open road. Other games such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, require you to think on your feet and can improve your reflexes. This @CAPS2 maker you dodge bricks and can greatly improves reaction time as well. All of the programs available via the computer can help you with real life obstacles and make you think createvly. Environmental changes really need in the current situation.People contribuation is very important in this matter.The report explains how my town people taking care of my surroundings and to preserve this planet in a betterway. This is espicially interesting because you can learn about a countries culture without actually going there. Nowadays, public transport is used for many people in the cities, we can find different types of them, such as bus tube and train, but is there a future for it or not?, I am going to respond this question giving disadvantanges and advantages and  finally I give my personal opinion. @CAPS4 once said ""@CAPS3 are afraid of only what is different than us, therefore, @CAPS3 have nothing to fear if nothing is different."" one day Michael decided to make a surprise party to sinha to make her happy and feel his love more so he arranged everything and to keep it surprise to her he was busy all the time and did not show off all the week as usual .that make sinha worried and suspect that Michael do not love her any more and know another girl and she become extremely sad and even it become worse when Michael asked her to go to his apartment to make  the surprise to her  but he did not answer his phone after that . Nowadays the public transporte isn't hardly necessary for our life.However,a lot cities have a problem about traffic,cause of this trouble that citizen don't use public transporte such as autobus, taxi, or even metro.Consequently,gorvernment start to support and take care of the public transporte. public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it is kind of becoming cheaper and also more safe but some  people prefer cars to extent do we agree with and what is our reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay  before about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was not even good facility to move from place to other and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans at the beginning the faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve it by the end nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and planes .some people prefer cars because the do like crowded places or because the find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places  to summaries it is different from some oneis opinion to another i predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end cars will disappear and will will no longer be used Lastly, the invention of computers allows us to communicate with people from all around the world. With the invention of @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6, @CAPS3 can talk to friends that move out of town. @ORGANIZATION2 reported that of its @NUM4 million users, @NUM5 million users have friends that live in a different country. Some public transports  as trains do not contaminate as cars or motorbikes.Many people said that public transport is not confortable, thats true, from my point of view bus is not so unconfortable. Sometimes, some tv shows are so great that helps you in determinate class,for example, Animal Plante can help you in biology, The History can help in history, etc... In my opinion the television can be good as books, and can also be a form of learning as good as only reads books, because TV is something fun, so you can learn and have fun at the same time. I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens.So I do not agree with this afirmation, in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport. Also 'internet' in our days helps to get information all over the world, and if you wish to get involved then go to the www.bbc.co.uk.These sites are free way to find most adequate information about actual events both in society and technical life. Programs like @CAPS5 allow you to make new friends as well as reconnect with old friends. In short, the birth of computer has allowed for vast improvement in society as a whole. so, i`m rely thinking left this sport.Everyday i get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends.i`m exercising more and more again to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world.i`m champion in my sport so, i`m seek to do all my effort to be the first one in the world.finally I did not find encourage of my family or my teachers. Its  popularity spreads all over world too.There are many reasons behind it to be popular.Everyone is able to enjoy the excitement throughout of this game the session.The people who eager to play football must follow some basic rules which are described below: 1.A football player should be punctual and hard-working. when he come she start crying and thought he would break up with her and she did not give him a chance to talk or explain anything she started to cry louder and accused him of cheating that make michael astonished how she did not trust in him ,how she thought that about him and he told her that he can not stand that anymore he would break up with her and he left .Michael close the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake In old times luxuries were not considered as compare to Heslth but now every one prefer to save time and maintain privacy which one can only afford by using her/his private transport so gradually public transport losing its charm. After two years that his essay was released, he will understand that his essay was wrong moreover, Michael will want to apologise many people who read his essay thereby Michael now goes home, takes a cup of tea, goes to bed thus Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake"	1

"In addition, stress is a clear disadvantage of compete because competitiors are trying to win and this can frustrates.But, some people do not think this like this and take it more simply Finally, I think that to compete in sports has some benefits and disadvantages, but when is controlated there are some benefits that help you to whole you life. I am also committed to preparing monthly reports for newspaper supplement “The Voice of Women” which issued by the WATC “Women's Affairs Technical Committee , and I have the cooperation with the Environment and Development the magazine which issued by Center for development work ""Maan"", annd other web sites and news and media organizations. Yes, it is true that computer give us advantages like messaging and information, but they also take away from some of the greater aspects of life: staying fit, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. Without those, life would be horribly unbeneficial. While surfing the web @MONTH1 be fun, it has been proven unhealthy.

Environment is the sorrounding.there is no aleartness in our locality.they were busy in their own work.everyone were not focus or see what hapening in our place.they use to speak about how hot today is?but they dont know what makes this much hot.iam interest in planting tree and makes sorrounding clean.some people used to burn forest as if those forest is useless.man are greedy  because of all the thing  getting from the forest are free. Mohammed is a kindly prophet born in small city called mekka and travelled to another city closed to mekka called almadina cause the people of mekka were very aggressive and they not accepted the new Invitation for the new religio Mohammed came back to his town mekka after that and forgave the people of mekka whose abused him I had truancy and did not pay attention to studies.That really the biggest harm to a hard-working woman whom my mother tried all her best to feed me up and help me complete my studies.All the members of my family never give me up,and I finished my college studies ,too .I have a good job now.I do really thank my mother and all the members for paying the patient and exertion to me .Now we have  great relationship with each other and treasure the happiness  we get not so easy.So,are the members of my family my best friends？I'll answer you ：there's not much better answer than Yes！ Strange things happen in the house, they are ""intruders"" in the house, anne saw many times someone called victor who ""play`s"" and the mother thinks she is lyeing but after a while she believe her and started searching for the intruders. Firstly, Django Unchained remembered us the hard life suffered by black people in the past, due to a great introduction without dialogues, where black people were unchained while they came back to be selling to an owner farm, it being matching with an amanzing soundtrack as identity Tarantino´s films. Thirdly,Public toilets has been opened for the public to elminate attitude of urinating in the public places.Town council not only encourage people to planting or garndening,it subsidise money for their green improvements.Example,free fertilizers,water pump failitiesand pesticides. @PERSON1 can recall the time when the trails @CAPS2 runs were overrun with people. hello, i want the job for the summer camp i'm looking for children between 8-12 years old i will help to organise sports and evening activities and if you want i could work in the kitchen if i have the job write soon                                                                   victoria Those are harder to act rid of that people."" But it's live, the trails and that to be fuller nature lovers are numbers. Because of today's new technologies, especially computers, the beauty of nature is being almost completely passed by. the development technology and Industry very fast , so the public transport no future , Must be Interesting the development transport Even fits the times. At the end, the kind of live that we will see in fifty years from now will have a lot of stuff to help the people to have a more comfortable, easier and faster way of live, but this will be only to meke more money and consume more and more, also the things will be faster of waste to make the people to change their apparel more often and create a consumerism. Doctors, @CAPS3, all people alike are seeing more and more how computers affect family life. How often do you eat dinner with the whole family. When you don't, where are you most of the time? Cricket has become a part of me since when I was a kid.Its very interesting sport.Cricket brings a passion on me whenever and wherever its possible I find out a way to start the game.I also watch cricket patiently.Its known as the gentleman's game.The best part of this game is batting whether someone knows or not he first prefer to bat.Batting has its own cherish.So, I also prefer to bat and hitting hard rather than bowling. This town is located in the central zone of the Afghanistan with 4462(km²) space, and has more than seven Million populations, the economic and security situation is not suitable and these factors have directly effect in to the carefulness of environment. My advice of finding work, is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work.But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase. mrs @PERSON4, an @NUM1 grade teacher in @LOCATION1, noticed that her family spent less time together than ever before when each family member got a laptop. I agree that communiting by car is easier and faster than most of the public transportation; however, there are serious problems come after it; the amount of vehicles on the roads keep increase and make congestion and pollution which are far more severe than the inconvenience causing by public transportation. so, i`m rely thinking left this sport.Everyday i get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends.i`m exercising more and more again to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world.i`m champion in my sport so, i`m seek to do all my effort to be the first one in the world.finally I did not find encourage of my family or my teachers. As you can conclude, computers have an awful influence, on society: people do not take, the time to stay fit, nature is being completely ignored, and Family interaction rates are poor. Whaat can we do to fix this problem? I'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant its name is ""Lemon"" I go there every week it has different food from any restaurants I'd like chicken crispy with garlic sauce It's Excellent choice for me and My favorite appitizer is susage and in order that desert I'd rather ""Vadge"" cake with chocolate sauce I feel I;m at ease when I go there I enjoy  classical music over having a lunch about the service It's very good and all staff are respectable I can't imagine one week without going there that drives me nuts I advise any one to go there and enjoy  a time there , also this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really It's  excellent This strikingly thing for anyone  despite all of these advantages prices are not expensive . The answer is simply; this museum has many types of momias.In 1810 have been a war for indepedent of Mexico many people were fight with other people; for example: Miguel Hidalgo is considerate: ""The father of indepedent"" and he was to fight with monarquia Spanish."	1

"The day of the competition and I came  with others  to show how I'd practiced.Then instructor said my name and I went out on the Tatami.when I left I had a special feeling many people look and clapping.It took 3 minutes I won with three accounts too.I was very happy because it was my first competition.After the end of the competition, we were all awarded medals and certificates.Then as always sounded Kazakhstan hymn. First of all,friends are important for us,we want a friend that we can share our secrets and problems.But friends maybe in the future go away or hurt you!So you can't always based on them!For example,they need you until they find someone better than you and in the end they go away.But family never let you go or family never go away from you! Except for some professors, most professors use English, a universal language, for some foreign students is classes. I used to live for a short time in a place where word recycle was completely ignored but they used to this because that wasn't so rich. But, Is it really helpful to students using English in all class? When I was returning from syleth I called the girl and talk to her and assure that I got chance in university but girl says that she knew it. So I want to change using only English in class. Good morning everyone,today I want to share about is my favorite sport.My favorite sport is football,why I choose it?Well,football is a international sport,people around the world will love it so much!Example like Barclay Premier League,Liga Premier,Fifa World Cup and so on.I believe that's all will delighted us.By the way,my favorite football team is Manchester United,they are brilliant,they have an amazing football players,and they are awesome. English is very different from Korean, so the intention of interpreting it in English and translating it into Korean may be different. On the rest of the boring week, I was watching TV and suddenly my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet, so I decided to solve my Paris puzzles with my sister, which was less than a half solved for about one year but it had too much color in the sky so I didn't finished then a year ago. In other way, I never be a witness , what I have to do?, tell me what cain of suit have the witnees have to wear, If I have to buyany colour of tie, the flower.... really I'm very exciting with your wedding. my English   language is weak , I like to improve it which complete my post graduate study,      The reason for choosing this specifically English language  in September  future I would like to get to know more information about   an English language course . Students try to find an easy and simple translation books to understand their hard and difficult major books written in English. In England where I live, in Bedford, we use a lot the train to go in the most important town of UK, but the train are very expensive, me and my family stay careful if we go off pick because the price are to high. they can use a translator for convenience, although they have to improve their thinking skills. Like this, students want to pursue convenience rather than improve their English skills. People who reach 18 have to complete military service is an issue, the supporters suggest that is helpful for the 18 to train the physical fitness and psychological quality, whilst opponents point out that is harmful for the human right and affect development of the country. My favorite sport is swimming.I engaged in swimming in nine years old.I had gotten first prize in a match.As a result,I think that I have some intellent on swimming.Since then,I meet my teacher in the pool.She teach me a lot of things,and be the most important figure in my life.She is a doctor,she told me that swimming will let my body more better.From then on,I fell my disease in decreasind and fell relax.Consequently,I need to swim usually. Also, the goal of getting students to study English is turning into a bad point. However, if we do not use English, additional measures such as posting additional notices in English will be necessary for foreign students because English is their own language. Obesity and other thins about help, is a topic very important because the people is dying for this problem.For example, the form to prepare the food, is gonna be dangerous because a lot food have artificial thing that is no good for us."	1

I will concede that there are explicit materials out there that are not suitable for children or even adolescents, but that is where the parent should step in by setting guidelines and positive examples which their children feel the need to follow. Firstly, the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel.Secondly, the public vehicle route are more far than usual route.Thirdly,it is also crowded and no privacy.Finally,there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker. If parents cannot take control and decide what is appropriate for their children, then in my mind, they are not doing their first and foremost job as a parent that is to protect the child. football is a fameous sport you can whatch it on tv or yo can see it on direct.there ara a lot of  level categories, the most fameous categorie is the first. As we know public transportation has not a direct way to fulfill our all destinations then it force us to stop in many stations first, moreover we should take the other one to reach our destination so it is already obvious why using a car is better. To sum up, do sports is very important for teenagers to which the body is going to grow and do it regularly is commitment that we should take. Looking for any sport make you feel good and your brain be always refresh so that you  can begin your day with any sport to making fresh and after that you can make any job with refreshment mind. The fact is that people cannot exist without strife and misery, and whatever people can do to cause that strife and misery, they will. when i ran with the ball, i feel that i hold a goal or a valuable something and i should offer my best to put it in his place and make it in right way  . I personally am appalled at the aspect of censorship, for if a person cannot speak his mind, then is he more than a mindless homunculi? First, Basketball is team sport when it means i need to understand expression of  members  of team and keep contact them  for example  my roll is cutter but i need to do assister, blocker and guarding when i play. Already public transport have been improvement and that makes comfortable to go on a trip,but I think that will be able to become good quality more and more,because so many people expectation. If in a society I  cannot say what I need to say then I do not wish to live in that society, for it is nothing but a horrible image of civilization. In short I do not believe that libraries should be censored, rather that parents should pay more attention to their children and dependents. The gym has many problems that we are gouing to explain : the first problem is that we don´t have enough aparatous for all of the students  the second problem is about that same aparatous are not working well because the school didn´t the manteinace long time ago For the first problem in my opinion , the school have to buy some others aparatus because there are not enough for all of the students For the second problem the solution for me is to hire someone to do the maintenance and say to all of the students to take care of the machines of the school I hope my proposal wiil be useful for you I look forward to hearing from you soon Sebastián Ferrari he took the money the second day , he finished the registration and started in writing the story after long time spending in writing and did good job he went to give his story to the international student magazine office ,he found out there are a notice on the door say that the competition has canceled, he came back vey sad and told me what happened .Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake ."	1
57	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"And the strengths and weaknesses in both of segmental and suprasegmental, I think it’s maybe the learning habit, when I heard a sentences, I would use many varieties of tone and manner to say the sentences again, therefore,I can easily be interpreted illustrations instructions the emotions and feelings. On the Internet and newspapers, many companies are looking for students to work for them. I don't think, however, it is a good idea for students to work part-time while they are going to school. I also don't think it is necessary, because parents support them and pay for their expenses. In addition, having jobs has some negative effects. he said kindly:""I buy you a present,open it,Tom"" Tom opened the big bag,Oh!This is a big surprise,there was a football in it,which he always wanted to buy there were some words goal!keep doing! To learn and get good grades, students have to study hard. To sum up, do sports is very important for teenagers to which the body is going to grow and do it regularly is commitment that we should take. In the present world television is very important.But sometimes it can also affect us in a negetive way..most people around the world can see any news in live.media is more help full for the people .television is also using as a study  material for example smart classes, online courses etc. He selected people to into in a chinese room, there was a computer in chinese language with diferente symbols, the american was a diferente behavior, they did not understand what was in the computer screen. This helicopter had humid then the helicopter star to rotate in all the island then the helicopter go sinking in the water then the hurricane finished  the engineers start to distribute the food and medicine. Finally, it will impact on their grades. Finally, if a student works part-time, he may miss out on the fun of his life. The first two step is to design with background color artwork and security issues and prepare metal plates with skilled machinists.Then there are some requirments for printing sheets:color on both sides, special ink and images slightly raised.The most essential and key process is manual inspections for printed sheets with three categories: good quality sheets, patially damaged sheets and bad sheets. You can see some store fridge around the market for Drinks and Dairy like milk, yogurt, cheese, butter and cream Also chest freezers for Ice creams .In a corner, they sell cosmetics and a salesperson helps customers to find their required . Some people guess the nuclear power has a great value to produce power instead of the fossil fuels such as : coals and oil which are Not renewable energy.Moreover, they think that controlling the pollution is possible. This is because their parents pay for their expenses, and parents help everything that they want. As i didn’t found nothing, i went to the place he live at and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he care about so as i continued to go to his houes i notice he will alays go to tehe same house so i decidec to follow him to the house and i foun out he was dating a girl she might be his girlfrien so i finally gota an idea, i would drive him crazy just as he did with me, that way she will think he had problems on his mind and left him, but son i thougt about it again and realized that if i did that she will try to help him and they will be more united,  so i decided to drive them both crazy almost at the border of death,  jus as he did with me! One day Penny discovered it and it go to tell it to his queen, the queen at knowing that she get very confused but at the same time she get mad and she wanted revenge.

"Consider both aspects that can be concluded that government should respect the human right and set up a new department which use for people who want to apply to complete the military service. In modern life,we rely on traffic to work or travel to everywhere.It is conveninet to travel by private cars .The price of private cars which every one can afford it,so that everyone has the private car nowadays .Some people point out private cars are going to replace the public transport . It should not be too expensive and it should use good ingredients. One thousand people by eighteen and more are questions in my town about their way takes care of the environment.Investigation reveals the youngsters are more than ever power to  save the world from waste and pollution. However, I want to change some part of our cafeteria if I can. In old times luxuries were not considered as compare to Heslth but now every one prefer to save time and maintain privacy which one can only afford by using her/his private transport so gradually public transport losing its charm. However, a lot of students stay at school on weekend. Therefore, students are not able to choose the menu at cafeteria. Some people say that a tripp by car is more convenient that by the public transportation, but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations.It is true that travel to a nearby place from your city, it  is more comfortable getting there by car, and the ease of have your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time paying  cabs. It takes long time and it is expensive. For these reasons, I want the cafeteria to open on weekend. Nevertheless the journalists stay all the time having a photo,all the time,when they eaten, drinking, happy, sad,how is your love life and with whoever stay, if stay with something important our what buy. If you want we could go to the capital city of my country, we will go by the car because the car is cheaper than the bus or train, we could eat in the famous restaurant of the city or we could go to the cinema also if you want I could visit the medieval wall. for example,using wind Energy or Solar Energy for electricity generation we will be used less fuel what is affected in emissions. If I go there by walk, it will take about 25 minutes to get there. There are many accidentally problems encountered by international students studying in Australia.It is believed that the most important one of the problem is culture barrier.Because of different culture backgrounds,the talking  style of internaional students who come from different countries are various. In conclusion, If I could change one important thing about my university, I will change some part of our cafeteria. I will change the cafeteria to open in weekend and to make new path for the students who live in the dormitory that is far from cafeteria. To begin with is design,we are able to considerate backgroud colour ,artwork,and security issues,and then,we are supposed to preparing mental plates,such as skilled and machinists."	1
59	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"we will know today some of information about Islam , Islam is great religion come from The Arabian Peninsula and its founded since 1436 years ago. When he was just about cursing the final line he got hurt and his mussels was dying and star to peel off a black matter, at that point the guys in suit thought that he won’t be able to cross the line , but when they saw that he kept running, they freeze the time and run after him, he stopped for a moment but then , he start running again and when he cross the line he woke up in a red somber fluid, he was wiped out from the matrix, he opened his eyes and saw a flying robot, suddenly he was on a wood wheelchair and they said that he would never be able to walk again , besides that, he stands up and tried to walk again. One of the example is television, in the past we use it only for watching news and movie, but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t, now television has others function. After an exhausting afternoon, Peter has a bit of luck, infact his father Jack has just came back from the work, so he could get to take the milk and giving him a passage. on the other hand, public transportation takes more time to get to the required station, because already public transport taking long path to go across more places and as more as peoples take benefits from it, and public transport usually crowed and do not be on time. So I do not have opptunity to practical English Because most of my colleagues speak French.They speak French in the meeting, in the gearm, and in the shopping Nothing would be left to read, listen to or watch. First, why I think censorship is wrong, is that the people that take offense to what they want removed, don't have to look at whats offensive. I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked.Pleasure to work at concerts is when  I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate.The experience  is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert. I'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant its name is ""Lemon"" I go there every week it has different food from any restaurants I'd like chicken crispy with garlic sauce It's Excellent choice for me and My favorite appitizer is susage and in order that desert I'd rather ""Vadge"" cake with chocolate sauce I feel I;m at ease when I go there I enjoy  classical music over having a lunch about the service It's very good and all staff are respectable I can't imagine one week without going there that drives me nuts I advise any one to go there and enjoy  a time there , also this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really It's  excellent This strikingly thing for anyone  despite all of these advantages prices are not expensive . Because other people, that don't take offense to it, have the right to look at or use it. In England where I live, in Bedford, we use a lot the train to go in the most important town of UK, but the train are very expensive, me and my family stay careful if we go off pick because the price are to high. Environmental changes really need in the current situation.People contribuation is very important in this matter.The report explains how my town people taking care of my surroundings and to preserve this planet in a betterway. Someone was calling the door while that someone was stealing in your house... By that, her sister is scared and woke up...  Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake Their child might even have the right to it. I love my small family.My family members are very helpful and supportive.My parents are very support.My parents are my best friends and guides.If any problems faced ,i'm went to my parents and say the problem,there are solve the problem.My family is my world.My parents are the good guides.There are my role model.some times we were go to the tour programs,it's very happy moments.My mammy told the story in night.Mom make the special foods in festivals. In all over the world people always need advices to keep looking after their environments .First ,the municipal should do workshops in schools and universities providing students by tips that should help us to make our environment clean .Second ,they should make awareness campaigns about environment ;for example , telling people to put their rubbish in waste papre basket which helping workers to recycling it easily .Finally ,to stay healthy we need a healthy environment . I believe that the parent should be able to trust their own child not to look at it. Third, this is the most important step that printed sheets manually inspected,the this sheets are classified three areas.The number one called good quality sheets,they will be packed and dispatched.The next called partially damaged shees,and bank notes separaed into good and bad, good sheets will be cutted into separate bank notes and packed,the bad one will be destroyed by fair.The number three called bad sheets ,they will be securely destroyed. The parent should be able to come up with a reasonable way of preventing their child from viewing things that they don't want the child viewing, rather than taking that thing away from the child, and the whole community. Lastly, let's say that in a library, theres at least one book to each person in a community that offends that person. If they were each given the right to remove the book that offended them, what would be left to read? Absolutely nothing. And each of those people that removed a book, most likely would enjoy another book that someone thought was offensive. So now there isn't a single book for that person to read, just because everyone else disliked the books they didn't think were offensive. Once someone starts removing, other people will join in, and you'd be left with an empty library. Thats what I think about cencorship. It's really just wrong. Personally, I would like to be able to go to my library and pick out a good book. In all over the world people always need advices to keep looking after their environments .First ,the municipal should do workshops in schools and universities providing students by tips that should help us to make our environment clean .Second ,they should make awareness campaigns about environment ;for example , telling people to put their rubbish in waste papre basket which helping workers to recycling it easily .Finally ,to stay healthy we need a healthy environment . Volleyball its my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I were in another world, in which I can be free and happy, apart of this, when I am bad, this is a distration of the university."	1

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @PERSON1, Computers are necessary and benefit our community. They do a great deal to help make our lives easier. There is not a day that we do not use a computer in some way or another. I used all of the things except two.I didn't have the Internet when I was child.And also we couldn't choose  programmes.I played in the street and walked to school alone.I'm thinking what kind if things were more dangerous for me?It was so dangerous when my friends and I swam in the Tobol river.We jumped into the water and caught crayfish.When I remember that moment I am exciting.I guess everychild want to investigate the world.We have to help them,to show and explain.What kind of risks they can get if to do that. although traveling by car is really interesting but still using public transport has its advantages ,by using public transport you're saving  effort when  driving a car for along distance you will get tired , some people don't have enough money to buy their own car . as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! Most modern day businesses are run by computers. Owners can now have businesses all over the world. With computers a business in @LOCATION2 or somewhere else in @LOCATION4 can be connected with a building in @LOCATION1. Sundully happanned sonething, I need to work to play my  studuies in the High  school, so the life changes anyway, I needed to stop my favourite sport, because I should need to study in that moment it was more important for me. First of all, although travelling by car  become more convenient,   the growing population which cause personal vehicle is hard to manage.The traffic jam  becomes more and more serious as far. looking at the information in more detail.Initially,bank note should be considered the design such as background colour ,artwork,and security issues.then,the preparation of metal plates is next stage.bank note should be skilled and machinists.thereafter,this stage is printing .worker should pay attention to colour on both sides,special ink , and images slightly raised. one day he got fight with her sister, even he made her cry.both of them stop talking to each other and after some day the boy need laptop of her sister sukh. In old times luxuries were not considered as compare to Heslth but now every one prefer to save time and maintain privacy which one can only afford by using her/his private transport so gradually public transport losing its charm. Stores can show buyers everything they have to offer including store locations. Today personal vehicle become pride of the life , mean if a person is on there personal vehicle they are look as higher status in the society . The computer not only connects stores and businesses but also people to people. I used all of the things except two.I didn't have the Internet when I was child.And also we couldn't choose  programmes.I played in the street and walked to school alone.I'm thinking what kind if things were more dangerous for me?It was so dangerous when my friends and I swam in the Tobol river.We jumped into the water and caught crayfish.When I remember that moment I am exciting.I guess everychild want to investigate the world.We have to help them,to show and explain.What kind of risks they can get if to do that. With all these computers many social networking sites are born. Even though do not everyone doing that,so how much public office is care of environment is important and this town is care of that a lot.Every morning some peasons are coming park and cleaned that makes feel really thanksgratitude. one of the most amazing parts of the film is when Teresa calls Cruel for go for them and take them again to the Cruel building and like all of them doesn't wanna go with them they start a war and they take Mihno with them and at the end Thomas decide to go after them and he give a super great speech for all the persons go with them and help him to get back Mihno, and what i really want to see in the next film is that if Thomas is mad at Teresa( i never like her) and if they get free and the world comes back to the normal world. First I will ask a question to you if this is your own house,you buy it with a lot of money and will you broke it with no reason? The other matter is about our habit to eating food together with our family that were a custom in humanity life not just in our culture,but now because of hard and busy life ,we had to eat our meal  mostly days of a week. so, on my opinion, even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers Therefore, computers conect people. When I was young , I enjoyed playing basketball.I thought that it's the best sport ever.It made me fit and strong.It taught me the meanings of teamwork and leadership.I Kept playing basketball 4 years continuously till I joined the secondary school.My advice to anyone starting basketball is to never giving up and always keep playing till the last minute. Without the computers most of us would not no about world news. I just finish my lunch time, and before prepare everything to go to work I was thinking of you and I wanted to give you a small surprise with this fantastic photos, I hope you like it. he took the money the second day , he finished the registration and started in writing the story after long time spending in writing and did good job he went to give his story to the international student magazine office ,he found out there are a notice on the door say that the competition has canceled, he came back vey sad and told me what happened .Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake . They would not have all of these donations. Also computers even broadcast national news. On one hand you put all your things in the car and drive anywhere you want to, on the other hand if you feel not very well to drive, you have no money to buy a car or the downtown of your city is closed for all the means of transport except for the public ones: tram, bus or trolley bus is your wayout. Besides, it’s also an environment problem, exhaust fumes engulfed the earth, more car is used, more exhaust gas release, we are killing our mother. One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance,  homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society. It would just be a click away. Meanwhile, different countries have different rules.For example,people always walk on the right of the road in China .However ,Australian’s rule specify citizen drive on the left of the road.Secondly,loneliness would be a big problem when a person who leave their own country getting away from family members and close friends.Thirdly, students can’t be accustomed to western eating habits like burgers,pizza and bread .According to the unfamiliar environment students may lack the sense of security.There will evaluate viable solutions to the problem.The most important way is that individuals should participate in student activities which held by the students from the same nationality so that they may not feel lonely .At the same time they can also actively communicate with local students to acquire more information  about  Australia culture  in order to suit quickly. On the rest of the boring week, I was watching TV and suddenly my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet, so I decided to solve my Paris puzzles with my sister, which was less than a half solved for about one year but it had too much color in the sky so I didn't finished then a year ago. Phones now can be personal tws, inernet, and messaging devises. The social networks such as: Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,Google plus... are connecting  us to more and more friends, companies, public figures, books, films, social organizations...we are really have many things to see, to think, to ""like"", to ""comment"" and a dozen of stuffs that we can make an action to interactive with others...so may it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves, to take care our healthy. Cars also have computers put into them. The @CAPS3 in our cars are computers; we would be lost without them. Micheal was afraid he was waiting for sara to get out he went to the shore to look if she went from the other side but he found no footprints.his mother called him he went home and still thinking about sarah.it was night and ge was afraid ti get there again.he went to sleep .michael closed the door and knew at this moment he had made a mistake. So, there is not a day where we do not incounter computers. You can see some store fridge around the market for Drinks and Dairy like milk, yogurt, cheese, butter and cream Also chest freezers for Ice creams .In a corner, they sell cosmetics and a salesperson helps customers to find their required .

Because  we have to follow international trend, English is very important language in world. However, science need steadiness and uniqueness for research.

Let me explain my reasons, when you drive your car you can take it from your garage or in the main door of your house and it gets you whatever you want, but on the other hand if you take public transport it will be much more uncomfortable because you must catch the bus in the bus stop... where is your nearest bus stop? Ask yourself, is it right? The answer for me is no, since books like that hold an educational value that outweighs their offensiveness. I  like to spend time cute little kids and  cooking is my favourite hobby.In the evening I would like to spend some time with those kids by organising some indoor and outdoor games for them.I would feel more energtic throughout the day If I have some busy or tight scheduled work,I have come across your advertisement For this job and I really think that I would suit this job in every aspect because I have a friendly move with people in and around me.I would be pleased to know for your positive reply. when he come she start crying and thought he would break up with her and she did not give him a chance to talk or explain anything she started to cry louder and accused him of cheating that make michael astonished how she did not trust in him ,how she thought that about him and he told her that he can not stand that anymore he would break up with her and he left .Michael close the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake @CAPS1 you feel it right to try and ban it again, but what does that solve?

By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we don't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars don't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport. As long as i try to keep doing thing on a ecofriendly way i realize that i am give a little from my side and i feel careful of my environment. Or you could ask yourself, what does it really solve?

"In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life, but majority of ones is totally utopic. All of the materials cover a really wide range of topics. he jump from his bed to the street and walk to his way to see what he did every morning.when he walk after the stranger man  he notice that he stopped in every trash in the street to take a look and go to the next one, and guess what he saw Michael and run away also Michael was afraid. Only if the government develop more technical property,pay more attention to the environment protection ,such as build more trees and grass in the cities ,and set a special low for those missed animals will help decrease the harm that the building project brings to us. In the reconquest age the stronghold never downfall with a direct assault, finally the Castellan's army after a large siege force to the government surrender it. One reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because it can lead to violence in teenagers. My town do much efforts to care of environment,they put many pins in the streets to keep it clean also they prevent private drivinig at many days to keep air clean ,they seed trees to absorb co2 and release o2 ,they build factories away from the house of population to prevent respiratory diseases which is a result of air pollution from factories,so not only my country it self but also the individuals follow a proper way to keep environment clean. In conclusion, we are assisting to a new tend in transport, every time, they are faster and more developer, with the latest technology included but at the oppossite case, we find also a contradiction, as we found an other trend for the tradictional transport which avoid the pollution in order to respect the Earth Michael is a good boy and he always listen to his mother .on time Michael was very angry as he got a bad score in his test .when he was home his mother was cooking she asked him what is the wrong ? My advice of finding work, is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work.But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase. As I told you before because of the technology many things has become able in less time, and with the pass of the years this tend to increase. One thousand people by eighteen and more are questions in my town about their way takes care of the environment.Investigation reveals the youngsters are more than ever power to  save the world from waste and pollution. She got the idea from the movie '@CAPS1', and her costume resembled the @CAPS2. Some students in the classroom at the time called @NUM1, and the police officers convinced the girl to put down the knife. My favourit sport is football i love it so much when i was young i used to watch football and my favorite team is Barcelona i was play with my friends at the street and we was happy with that so much and after that we played at playground like really football i love Cristiano Ronaldo so much he is the best player at the world a few people telling me that messi is the best player but i feel angry when i hear that because that is not true so i looking forward to meet my best player one day its like a dream to me . Another reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because the material is sometimes inappropriate for younger children. The children might just be looking at books and magazines in the library and not even check it out. This way no one will know that they read it. Volleyball its my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I were in another world, in which I can be free and happy, apart of this, when I am bad, this is a distration of the university. When the child reads this, he might want to do everything that is in the book. At first, I had called a travel agent but he said he couldn’t be able to book me a flight before two months, so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent. The book might put awful ideas into the child's head if he read it. After all is said and done, offensive material should be removed from libraries. As long as i try to keep doing thing on a ecofriendly way i realize that i am give a little from my side and i feel careful of my environment. Its very simple and wonderful sport.If you play cricket you are surely going to burn many bad calories adhered inside your body.In India cricket is worshipped and players are the lord.The best part of this game is you can play with every age group at a single time.I was very interested in making my career through this but due to my studies I can't take effort toward this. All in all, material in libraries can be offensive to some people."	1

Everyone-- teachers, students, parents, school board members, community leaders-- had something to say about the topic at hand. This topic was censorship. A high schooler's parents were outraged that their daughter had read The @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 in class. secondly these mode of transportation covers      as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routine who travelled by public transportation.as a consquence generally people avoid travelling by public transportation finally i can say that there are various mode of transporotation avaliable  to competition with public transportation. While this seemed a fair stance to take, the parents then took things a step further. They sought to ban the book in the schools in our township, wanting to spare all other children the experience of being exposed to @CAPS1 was clearly traumatic material. This crusade of theirs posed the questions '@CAPS1 can and should be censored? First,the bank notes are designed by consider,thinking from background colour,artwork,security issues.Then,the metal plates are preparated by skilled machinists.And then, the sheets are printed,operator should pay attention to the colour on both sides,special ink,and images slightly raised. As the debate continued, I myself begin to ponder the subject. although traveling by car is really interesting but still using public transport has its advantages ,by using public transport you're saving  effort when  driving a car for along distance you will get tired , some people don't have enough money to buy their own car . I just finish my lunch time, and before prepare everything to go to work I was thinking of you and I wanted to give you a small surprise with this fantastic photos, I hope you like it. for example, lunch time travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emission of carbon mono oxide which is effected to red blood cells and irritate to breathing system. Second advantage is Internet by website, such as twiter, facebook... You allow speak with your quick friend, or you can meet ith them by website, therefore you do not call by telephone, so internet is too much cheap. No one has the right to censor anyone else. When I was returning from syleth I called the girl and talk to her and assure that I got chance in university but girl says that she knew it. Parents have the responsibility to monitor their children. As long as i try to keep doing thing on a ecofriendly way i realize that i am give a little from my side and i feel careful of my environment. This was true in the censorship of @ORGANIZATION1, as well. To sum it up I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convinient.Public future unless they have project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger. I notice that in supermarkets are using so much plastic just to cover a small thing or are using many plastic bags without even think how vulnerable is for the environment. Music you love @MONTH1 be offensive to me. Books your @CAPS2 teacher assigned @MONTH1 not be appropriate for five year olds. Your friends @MONTH1 be offended by your favorite movie or @CAPS3 show. I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked.Pleasure to work at concerts is when  I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate.The experience  is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert. positives ways for playing badminton: you can lose weight , you vision will be good etc   negatives ways for playing badminton: you right arm is more strong than you left arm , sometime,you are sprain your arm . Nowadays the public transporte isn't hardly necessary for our life.However,a lot cities have a problem about traffic,cause of this trouble that citizen don't use public transporte such as autobus, taxi, or even metro.Consequently,gorvernment start to support and take care of the public transporte. These experiences teach us @CAPS1 to do, as well as teach us @CAPS1 not to do. In the present world television is very important.But sometimes it can also affect us in a negetive way..most people around the world can see any news in live.media is more help full for the people .television is also using as a study  material for example smart classes, online courses etc. To do that would be to steal from community members their chance to learn. Parents have the right to censor @CAPS1 their children see, hear, and read, but even this censorship must be done carefully in order to not hinder the child's ability to learn. For all the people I advise to start to play or watching football because for me it is a very good sport , but you can play a good football only if you really like it , because first football is fun . If we do take away that ability, we are setting these future adults up for making mistakes that could have been prevented by allowing them the chance to learn. Removing materials from the shelves of libraries based solely on opinions is not only damaging to our society, but, ultimately, it is dangerous to the people we wish to protect"	1
65	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and I am a @ORGANIZATION1 citizen. My name is Abrar saeed Al-mubarak.I'm 13 years old.I live in Saudi Arabia(Riyadh)  .And i'm in grade nine.I have 9 sisters with me we 10 .And 9 brothers.I really love to learn English lounge & French lounge spinach lounge  .And I speak Arabic . But i know that a lot of joung people play tennis, i hope that the italian tennis player in a few years  will be very famous all over the world , then you don't wait you sign up in a tennis club and you will become a famous tennis player! People spend way too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. All of these things are @CAPS3 computers are doing to our society and it's time to make a stop to it! ""Annabelle"" is a horror movie which i am going to watch this Saturday.I am wondering if i will be scared after the movie.The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was closed in a museum from Conecticut where she is visited  by a preist  who blesses her twice a month.John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife :a beautifull colection doll dressed in a wedding dress.Unfortunatelly,in a horribble night the couple""s house was invided by a satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them.The satanists invoced an eavel entity that is capabale of the worst things...Annabelle.After Mia gives birth to her doughter Lilly,Annabelel wants to kill her.Even the preist doesn's know how to help the unhappy familly.Everyone is terryfied and find out that a demon is attached by the doll.Idon't know the end of the story but i don;t think that is a happy one... Teens are on social networking sites, adults are on chatrooms, and kids are playing computer games. At first, I had called a travel agent but he said he couldn’t be able to book me a flight before two months, so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent. In this view, I consider, though, there is lots of sports on Televison, they are not too much, because the people have looke for it. If people cut back the amount of time indoors, we could probably bring that number way down. Also, who knows @CAPS3 teens are doing on the computer. Computers have good things but they can also be bad. For example, chatrooms who knows @CAPS3 kind of people are in chatrooms. I think that the  public  transport always going to be so important in our life  because  not all the people have the possibility to buy a car because the public transport is more expensive than a car, so for that reason the public transport in the future  could be exist, because public transport is a necesity in all the world not only for the money but too for the facility to take a bus or any other public transport The island was flood but the island had a levee that prevent a flooding then in many year a engineers star constructing a building to had more money then in the city put many advertising in all thing : ball, balloon, movies ,etc. Second, more citizens need to enjoy nature and the beautiful senery around them. Were all so busy running to check our e-mail, we don't notice @CAPS3 a beautiful day it is outside. But, on the other hand, because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable; cars are so many; very noisy, unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth. According to the information donne, the most used is the car thus most of the families has one, but the public transportation is getting more and more common for those ones who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectfully with the planet. yes, i agree, if you planed the travelling for a long distation and for a long time you would prefer to do it on car, couse firstly you;ll spend less time, you travelling will be comfortable, you'll have a possibility to stop every where and for a long time, as you need. Thirdly,Public toilets has been opened for the public to elminate attitude of urinating in the public places.Town council not only encourage people to planting or garndening,it subsidise money for their green improvements.Example,free fertilizers,water pump failitiesand pesticides. This kept us active and enjoy the environment. Nowadays a person's worth seems to be judge  according to the social status and material possessions, that is mostly to happen in high class famiies, as they are foccus on achievements as power, political influences etc. Fdi can play important role in it.It give competition to national companies .By virtue of which they  work properly mannerly and give better option to policy holders.people can always buy nominal premium we should aware them about the types of insurance as well as benefits of the insurancce. Instead of instant messaging call them. Only if the government develop more technical property,pay more attention to the environment protection ,such as build more trees and grass in the cities ,and set a special low for those missed animals will help decrease the harm that the building project brings to us. One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance,  homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society. MEASURES IN FAVOUR OF TAKING CARE THE ENVIRONMENT The council is carrying out a project in order to erradicate the rubbish in my town.This project is focused on separating the rubbish in each green points of the city and also they have to maintain their neighbourhood as clear as are possible. This experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister (I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money. Only if the government develop more technical property,pay more attention to the environment protection ,such as build more trees and grass in the cities ,and set a special low for those missed animals will help decrease the harm that the building project brings to us. So I do not have opptunity to practical English Because most of my colleagues speak French.They speak French in the meeting, in the gearm, and in the shopping i know that i am not professional player and i am n't belong to any team  but i like this game .basketball is so simple play but it is need Speed ,concentration and The ability to determine the distances  , it  contains of two team of five player and each team try to get a high point by throwing the ball through the basket. Not only @ORGANIZATION1 but everywhere! You need to open your eyes and understand that people spend way too much time on computers, they allow people to not enjoy nature, or interact with their families. Espesialy there are a lot of greens these makes good health.However someone have to take care of them.The town have to do that and I think in England there are so many greens all around,so a lot of people take care of these that makes good environment.After I have been to live in England with my family I have goton the feel very much indeed. So @CAPS3 are you going to do about it?"	1
66	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Everybody thinking like the public transport is not comfort for us, but environmentally the public transport is suitable to decrease the pollution and our energy sources also decrease. On the other hand, other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Technology advance way to fast and it is really difficult guessing what kind of stuff or artefacts will be fifty years from now, but we can guess some ideas like flying cars, smartphones with the size of a small paper, laptops really thin like quarter of inch, clothes that clean itself or change the color and shape, healthier food, smarter electrodomestics. With a great effort sate down on the grass, he feels tired, and has a little sensation of pain in his boson, site there with many sounds on air, he star recall...his face is changing is dark, he has now a clear image of all, when opened the door of the house his girlfriend is there dying on the floor, Michael remember all, the fight, the lays, the screams, the knife...the blood; but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. One night,as usual,I slept.In a flash,I rolled down from a mountain and I didn't know where I was.It just a very long tunnel where was dark and strange,After,I felt my body ache.I began to yell that hoped someone could  save me to leave from here. First of all, a person who have specialized in one specific subject is likely to be lack of a wide competence. I am currently double majoring in Computer science and Industrial design. Many courses of the department of the Industrial design for the students in more than third year requires the ability to make a computer program, being able to embedded in the product. In other words, there are lots of assignment or projects requiring not only designing the products that looks beautiful but also giving special functions to them. For example, some students majoring in Industrial design produces a color-changing lamp that recognizes the color of marbles which the user put into the lamp or a music player that plays love songs when the user draw a heart shape or songs related with rain when the user draw a rain drop shape on the player. Many students in the department of industrial design now choose Computer science of Electrical Engineering as their double major or minor, since it allows them to show more powerful performances with various knowledge. Furthermore, since students are still learners, not workers yet, they have to experience different fields that they have not done before. In Korea, students should choose their future job to go to an university usually when they just became a high school student. Then if you want we could go to the restaurant of the city later if you want we could fiand a job for three months, in my opinion a good job for three months I could be the waiter because the waiter get much money in the three months of the summer. One night,as usual,I slept.In a flash,I rolled down from a mountain and I didn't know where I was.It just a very long tunnel where was dark and strange,After,I felt my body ache.I began to yell that hoped someone could  save me to leave from here. In these diagrams below,the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly.The first step,the bank notes should be desinged concidering some constructions,like background color,artwork and security issues,After it was prepared,skilled machinists would make preparaation of metal plates in the second step.Then,sheets of bank notes would be printed by 50 bank notes per sheet,which have colour imagines on both sides in special ink.After printing well,these sheets would be manually inspected closely.It was the most important step during the whole processing.And then,some  sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets  which would be cut into and separated into equal ones andpacked and depatched to where they are demanded. I used to live for a short time in a place where word recycle was completely ignored but they used to this because that wasn't so rich. Firstly, students can achieve wide view throughout various subjects, which can be applied to their future works usefully. Moreover, since most of students who are only 20 or 21 years old are too young to find the thing that they really want to be, universities have to be the places for students to spread their wings by letting them experience more subjects than they expected. I like going to the cinema, get out with my friends,  to playing the counter strike, walking to the park, going the shopping and can't stand watching the blood."	1

"Dear readers, On the current debate of the effects of computers, I believe they strongly benefit all people. For example on some computers a business software can be incorporated, allowing a meeting to be help over the computers. Not only is it convienent, but this saves money. Also, computers come with built in programs that can help keep track of you expenses. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , that ha has planned two weeks ago  this episode was his sister's birthday ,"" Now it is the suitable moment to announce her about surprise "" peter said . Plus, computers also help you stay in touch with friends. Even if they are @NUM1 miles away you can click a button and have a live video chat! Sara stood and stared  here for a few minuets and hug here and bowed here for coming  and thanks here they hadn't meet for several years after they have finished their study .Really  it was great moment and stay speaking together about many things and call the best moment that collect them together , stay speaking until the evening .and agreed to visit their collage at the weekend to recall the best memories , peter who is arranged this celebration and connected with Tia and prepared for all this happen Sara never forget that day . You can make a brochure of sales and expenses, all with an easy stroke on the mouse. This is a cheaper and greener way of presenting ideas. Furthermore, on the computer you and all you clients can hold a conference call. In addition, stress is a clear disadvantage of compete because competitiors are trying to win and this can frustrates.But, some people do not think this like this and take it more simply Finally, I think that to compete in sports has some benefits and disadvantages, but when is controlated there are some benefits that help you to whole you life. This sport cause fresh and jolly me and I think will exercise cause healthy.if you start volleyball, you need a ball and piece of ground that separate with tie. Tom friend of Peter suddenly fainted fell down in the class room I don't know what to do immediately, first calm down yourself and I checked his pulse beat it is okay,then I knew that he is out of danger so I called my classmates everyone rushing to the spot but still he is not moving so we decide to take him into the hospital or call the ambulance, finally we  call the ambulance without ant delay. This book made me interesting and I begging reading more and more while I read the more I love it  this time everything  did not matter to me I want to finish the book  as soon as possible I do not know the end but I want the end of the book was amazing but the same time I do not finish the book because the mystery to open up finished in. We're looking for a new nice home and so we are truly interested to keep your place tide and take care about it as it were our own. Using these tools cut down an stress and leaves you less frustrated. But today, Things are getting change and technology marked a significant role in our life, Automobile segment increased its vertical and having a car becomes a need from luxory. Think about, paying somebody to count your taxes year after year, when you can save a fortune and do it yourself. ?XD)Cherry blossom is very beautiful but there are so many people.When we went to Sun Moon Lake by cable car,wind is so strong!I felt a little nervous though the scenery amazing.All in all,I stil have a memorable vacation. Now, the internet contains many social networking sites, such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 where you can reunite with lost pals. Firstly,design the bank notes' backgroud colour it is artwork security issues.Second preparation metal plates.It's skilled machinists.Then the sheets of bank notes printd .Printing colour on both sides and sprcial ink or images slightly raised. we will know today some of information about Islam , Islam is great religion come from The Arabian Peninsula and its founded since 1436 years ago. This is totally private, so it isn't dangerous to say names of family members or their locations. On the one hand, there are alot of famous player on volleyball who had Knee ligament injuries ,The most frequent mechanism of injury was landing from a jump in the attack zone.In addition to this,Injuries were more frequent during games than training. Our Mistakes mistake made us better than before if in life we had't got any mistake  we wouldn't succeed that's why  the mistakes are very important in life and I believe  our mistake improve us so but in another way there just one mistake and you could not come back or arranged your mistake Not only can we see who man the @ORGANIZATION2 game, but it also has interactive business softwares as well. This is due to Lima in the beginning  has not had a pant to desing its public road s and highways, and it only has been improvising to build their way without any criteria to transport its population. Also, the computer has programs to help you manage expenses, keeping you on top of your game. To start with,there are a wide range of troublesome it maybe leadding to this phenomeon.Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the persent day cities are already packed with places of residence,commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce.Additionally, people now continues destroyed more agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their need,which will distory the ecosystem  diversity and biodiversity especially the endangered species. my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long. My town is very beautiful and I like it very much because it is not any dirty streets in it  The governor of my city seek to develop it and he said it will be the capital of delta actually after 30 years ago the people in my town deal with rubbish by healthy method , the citizens collecting the rubbish and threw it in big boxes far away the city."	1
68	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"I think smartphones haven't destroyed communication among family and friends for following three reasons. First,  smartphones have enhanced a new type of communication among people, such as messenger apps and social network services. Instead of talking to each other, many people choose to communicate with other people through SNS. Moreover also simple things are changed, for example the food we eat: some times ago everythingh was natural, healthy... but now everyone eat always ""junk food"" and thinghs like that, which are completely unhealthy ! For instance, even though I use smartphones, I still talk to my friends every day. for carreer has 80% under 26 years old students are taken it, for the age over 49 years old only has 20%people are taken; but if you counper interest, it is totoly different; for under 26 years old have only 10%; but for over 49 years old it has 70%. The future for the public transport shouldn't be  taken lightly,  in my opinion, the public transport is the best option for ending the problems with the traffic jam because when we use a bus or subway , a lot of people is travelling from one place at other in only one transport or vehicle. But now I really enjoyed, and me best friend both for me ticket for a theatre to see the musical show ,which was amazing, for cuople of hours I didn't move, was a brilliant present. There are a few people are using puplic transport, like students and someone had low income.in my veiw, i can say might be the puplictransport going to e close because nobody is going to beclose"	1
69	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Nowadays, as the world is developing rapidly, everyone is competing each other. They have their dreams to be successful in life, so they try to find the methods which can lead them to success. Although some people prefer taking risks for the success, making a well-prepared plan is another interesting method which can bring people to reach thier goals. One can select their best choice from a plan that they make. To make a careful plan, they have to spend much time to consider the possible positive and negative impacts of their choices; therefore, one can predict what the consequence of their choice is. For example, one who is going to enter a university. One will select the university which best fits their preference. First of all,we should thinking out a design and dicide the background colour and artwork,or even security issues.And then for the preparation of metal plates ,the skilled and machinists is considerate.Nect,printing,sheets of bank notes printed (50 bank notes per sheet)colour on both sides,and specWell,the most important step is inspection,we should printed sheets manually inspected. He selected people to into in a chinese room, there was a computer in chinese language with diferente symbols, the american was a diferente behavior, they did not understand what was in the computer screen. the public transport  have no future , the crisis in 2008 ; has been down the oil prices .The oil is cheap now and new cars are more efficient and the goverment give stimolous for consumers. This statement might be true. Nevertheless, a well-prepared plan can make sure that  people can solve the mistakes quickly and easily. The last mistake that I have had to have been when I changed the telephone company because since I changed I have many troubles. To our relief,she was saved and when we went to granny room,we saw smile on her face.We were also happy,but in Michael head came a lot of things.He knew that if we escape at that moment when the granny was at the ground,she would most probably die.Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Today personal vehicle become pride of the life , mean if a person is on there personal vehicle they are look as higher status in the society . In conclusion, people can make the best choice and encounter the possible mistakes if they make a careful plan. But, on the other hand, because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable; cars are so many; very noisy, unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth. Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real."	1
70	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"From the point of view of a student, books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves just because of the material it contains. To begin with,the format of the bank notes needs to be designed,factors of considerations including the background colour,the artwork and the security issues.Sencondly,equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps.Thirdly,print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink,where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes. So, lets start, Most of the Metro cities are now days attract people of city towards Metro only not just because of the fare but because of the time that it saves. It's in society. These things are everywhere, and just taking these materials off the shelves are not going to solve the problem. first we uses Internet to discover the world's news, from Internet we can check and read world's most famous newspaper such as new York times, the sun and also electronic newspaper.Internet also can be used to learn and to educate yourself, internet allow us to read books, magazines and short stories.Internet is the most effective way to start a business and to look for a job, many people uses Internet to work , and they earning money every month.Internet is a way to make new friends all over the world through social websites such as Facebook,twitter, and you tube.As a conclusion internet is making things better and easier, life now is always connected to the Internet. you are responsible for your workers and the customer satisfaccion, However is very satisfying to see how your own company is grow up and your customers return again because they loved your job. Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe, in fact there is some important tournament where participate all important Europe team,They are called ""Champions League"" and ""Europa League"".football is a team sport in fact in this sport participate everyboby without exclude nobody. However, I have no agree with this statement because the public transport is needed for someone who are no have vehicle or economic downturn. Billboards, signs, books, magazine, music, television, movies, etc., but taking things like books, movies, music, and magazines off the shelves are not going to stop the inappropriate behavoir. It was a cold day at night when I was at home watching my favourite programme on my telly called ""dare to win"", I was with my brother, when we decided to call, The programme is about questions for the contestants that must be answer in correct time, and there is a different things for the winner. You still have commercials, billboards, etc. To my mind our lives has been improved in these years by smarphone, satnav, digital TV, Internet.. Let's suppose a teenager of twenty-first century during the Middle ages.. don't get out alive without Wi-fii! Ban your children from life in general? No, I don't think so. I just finish my lunch time, and before prepare everything to go to work I was thinking of you and I wanted to give you a small surprise with this fantastic photos, I hope you like it. One day many years ago in something place that a don't remember the name I woke up one morning more earlier than usual then I went to the kitchen and shout the name of my mother...but no one answered, and the first thing that I imagine is that they come to the town, quickly I went out to find they... But there was no one, absolutely no one, I'm scary, I yell and scream, look and look but I had no result  Suddenly I felt a warm hand that touched my shoulder and very slowly turn but the only thing I saw was a shadow that was holding a knife     I woke up and realised it had all been a bad dream Her mom tried to tell Fernanda that they arrived very late because they had a very perplexed problem, so her mom told her that they came out from the park at 9:00pm it was still late but not too late, so they were on the street and the police arrived because they police thought that she had a globe with wine, and her mother told the police that she doesn't have alcohol or wine on her car, and they police didn't believed her and they took them to the police station so they could check his car, and about 10 minutes approximately they told her that she didn't have nothing so they, went from there to their house and it was late, so that’s the reason. I also read every single one of @PERSON1 books. All of them are about people who do drugs, are suicidal, and do sexual related things. These books are extremely good. Good Morning: This is an esay about my favourite sport,it is swimming since I was a child because always enjoy a lot and what is more I can do it alone, I never refuse to go swimming pool and less in summer, of course. Lastly , workshops about conservation of environment to increase environmental awareness among people to encourage them to take care of their city , and how they can recycle some rubbish to beneficial objects to exploit it at home . From my experience, reading these things are honestly kind of helpful. It takes you deeper into things. i like volei because it was part of my life and of life of my mother, is my favorite sport, but i like over sports too, same i don't play volei because I'm bad, and my friends that know, don't like of  peoples bad of volei.I'm watching they playing, they're really very good, but when play over school, they're very bad The answer is simply; this museum has many types of momias.In 1810 have been a war for indepedent of Mexico many people were fight with other people; for example: Miguel Hidalgo is considerate: ""The father of indepedent"" and he was to fight with monarquia Spanish. Back to my experience with the @PERSON1 books, you read stories that are based off of her life and relationship with her daughter. Crank, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 is a trilogy of books that show the life of @LOCATION1. first we uses Internet to discover the world's news, from Internet we can check and read world's most famous newspaper such as new York times, the sun and also electronic newspaper.Internet also can be used to learn and to educate yourself, internet allow us to read books, magazines and short stories.Internet is the most effective way to start a business and to look for a job, many people uses Internet to work , and they earning money every month.Internet is a way to make new friends all over the world through social websites such as Facebook,twitter, and you tube.As a conclusion internet is making things better and easier, life now is always connected to the Internet. The gym has many problems that we are gouing to explain : the first problem is that we don´t have enough aparatous for all of the students  the second problem is about that same aparatous are not working well because the school didn´t the manteinace long time ago For the first problem in my opinion , the school have to buy some others aparatus because there are not enough for all of the students For the second problem the solution for me is to hire someone to do the maintenance and say to all of the students to take care of the machines of the school I hope my proposal wiil be useful for you I look forward to hearing from you soon Sebastián Ferrari All this will help people to live easily, but only to have more time to work, because the type of mind that reign that time will focus in the companies and make money and spend it, this is the reason why a lot of jobs are changing to a home office and the firms are giving more and more facilities to their employees to be more efficient. As we are fully depending on the indivitual generators ,that are causing multiple problems in he weather dueto it's smoke, the oil and gass left behind , in addition to sound offcourse that are themain source for the 18 countinous hours noise. The future of public transport in developed countries is very different, because most people have a car, in   the people who live in poor countries, most people take public transport, because people doesn´t have a car and is cheaper take public transport, the pollution of public transport is huge and is growing third world countries should have, eco friendly transport. I played so good that everyone gave me congratulations but thats not all one of the best team of the world wanted too take me. Also, you can't escape explicit material. I have learned to  get control of myself when someone teaes me , and to be alert as well .Also ,it helps to look always slim and put me away from the ghost of obesity as well .People who want to start playing karate have to be patient . You just have to accept the fact that it's there, and it's not going away. If you think your children are going to start doing those kinds of things after reading them, talk to them about it. You can't protect your children from offensive material. At least not forever"	1

On the one hand, there are alot of famous player on volleyball who had Knee ligament injuries ,The most frequent mechanism of injury was landing from a jump in the attack zone.In addition to this,Injuries were more frequent during games than training. Invention of car has made people's lives easier.No more they have to solely depend on public transport.Though public transport are cheaper and one could get to know many companions ,increase network.But public transport has fixed schedule and on a rushing day not many can really enjoy their journey. He selected people to into in a chinese room, there was a computer in chinese language with diferente symbols, the american was a diferente behavior, they did not understand what was in the computer screen. I love my small family.My family members are very helpful and supportive.My parents are very support.My parents are my best friends and guides.If any problems faced ,i'm went to my parents and say the problem,there are solve the problem.My family is my world.My parents are the good guides.There are my role model.some times we were go to the tour programs,it's very happy moments.My mammy told the story in night.Mom make the special foods in festivals.

Firstly,design the bank notes' backgroud colour it is artwork security issues.Second preparation metal plates.It's skilled machinists.Then the sheets of bank notes printd .Printing colour on both sides and sprcial ink or images slightly raised. Like wise, with this online communication you can also talk and and video chat as if you right there with your friends not everyday do you get to go hang out with your friends so this is an easy alternative. Not only is quick and easy it's free. Travelling by car is convenient but there are dis advantage as well.As our population growing fast in a family both husband and wife working and children at university able to drive, so you are looking per house least 3 cars, so imagine how busy our roads will be.As now fuel price coming down that does not mean that it will stay like that for ever, price go up and down. The most important effect computers have on society is the gathering of information. Her sons have a problem they cant see the natural light and one they Grace got up because her children were shouting and crying so she went to their bedroom and the courtins was not there so she go to the other room and the courtins also were not there so she stars getting nervous and more nervous so she go and talk to the servants, so she got very angry and she told them go out of my house and they did not care so she pick up a gun and the old lady returned her keys. Every second of the day their is someone on the internet searching for date that they would have to go to the library to get. Computers are a key part in society and we depend on them without them we would all be lost. They provide an easier way to life that us lazy @CAPS1 need to survive. After waiting an hour the time comes and bravely  with high confident level he walke to the office. Adolescent has always been the hardest part throughout anybody's whole life.. turning out in a fleeting glimpse into an adult, perceiving the other side of life,how tough and complicated it is, trying to deal with its different circumstances.. at this point you merely have a brief look at your whole life, many questions spinning in your head, accusing yourself of being a lost cause, wishing if you could turn the clock back,,but it's all no good.. then you find yourself standing ahead clouds of reality, which sucks.. life is stages, this stage of your life is timeless, no way out.. at some point you wish if it was all illusio, you need a time machine makes it possible to go back in time when you could see the purity of life.. However..here you are completely different made of life lessons, preferring to make a stiff upper lip..cowering in your own reality. One of the largest aspects of life computers have helped us with is research. Computers have multiplied our man power giving us more organized way to store date. ""As you well know, rose's life is your hands"" she said and keep talking:""...You are the only one, that can save her life, but before you must comply with your promise"". They also help us be different and more creative people. hello, i want the job for the summer camp i'm looking for children between 8-12 years old i will help to organise sports and evening activities and if you want i could work in the kitchen if i have the job write soon                                                                   victoria They have lead us to think we can do greater things in life and keep our earth safe and to stop damaging it as much.

72	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"Does why, is easy to believe that if things continue with this rhythm and transforming everything, in a closer future of 50 years everything is gonna be completely knew and different. Jobs serve a few main functions: to earn money, to gain experience, to get a head-start in a career, and to have something to do. In addition, A general vision on the human innovation show that the majority of people creations have bad effect, this effect exist even in people's lives or themselves. I think it would be important that, not only in the family, but also in the school could be grow a new generaion sensible to ecological problems of the earth. Alternatively, a student might take up a job to gain experience and expand their horizons beyond the merely academic, and consider this an important pursuit. Another student might, however, find the time spent on a job to be better spent on their college work, studying and getting the best grades they can, so as to be able to (ideally) get a better job in future. Yet another student might wish to enjoy their last few years of freedom before entering the workforce, and find it more important to have free time to spend on leisure, rather than on a job. while we are spendind good time watching TV our brain is not in calm, only in an other position different to that ones in the rest od the day.That's why I think that it's a good momento to see the thing through a new glass and that can be a very high opportunity. In addition, we will adjust company’s management direction in each department depend on market’s reaction and environment Like retailer, We have sold our products to KA system for few years, however, the products that we sold were usually popular consumer goods, it means cheat and have no enter obstacles for other supplier."	1
73	"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"I rested my back on the cool steel of the lockers trying to ease my nerves. I am also committed to preparing monthly reports for newspaper supplement “The Voice of Women” which issued by the WATC “Women's Affairs Technical Committee , and I have the cooperation with the Environment and Development the magazine which issued by Center for development work ""Maan"", annd other web sites and news and media organizations. It was all to prepare us for tonight. She always tell me some jokes but some times i laughed !,i love her so much,i don't know how will my world being like without her and i won't to know . I listened attentively as @PERSON1, our team captain, spoke. Everybody thinking like the public transport is not comfort for us, but environmentally the public transport is suitable to decrease the pollution and our energy sources also decrease. I choose the wheel because is the most useful invention ever because thanks to it the human works make easier by example a way to move heavy objects, compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today the wheel was invented at a relatively late point of human history, he oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia. Emilie was vigorously chewing what was left of her nails, while @LOCATION1 preferred to show her uneasiness by the constant tapping of her foot. @PERSON1 finished her speech, and with the break of our huddle we entered the gymnasium. last summer i worked at cinema.i think it is a very good job because you can see any films you like for free.The minus of this work is very big salary and i think that i will work at this cinema on the next summer. The film is a romantic movie, It is talking about one man, Noa, who lives in a small shore town when he felt in love with a rich girl, but like always the girl´s parents did not like Noa´s life because the girl´s father thinks that Noa is not enough good for their daughter. @CAPS1 brutal reminder brought my attention back to warm ups. The village I live, there is a lot of vegetation for that reason we try to protect environment, some of the things we do is to give mantainance every week to the vagetation zone checking if there is any garbage, to avoid this we teach the younger´s enviromentalist actions so they don´t throw cans,paper,or,candies to the floor they also can help the older people, there are cases which a person throws garbage to the street´s,floor or to the vegetation to avoid that happening again we have a punishment that is to pay some money if the don´t they wont be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again, unless they were visitors, in that case we told him or her the way we live in the village and, we give him or her advises to keep a beautiful place without garbage. The announcer began to state our starting line up, but it was no use. If you are living in big town or small It does matter but one thing should be taking care by the people and organiser of the town, is environment.Global warming  is huge issue in today's date. It seemed as @CAPS7 everyone from our town of five thousand was attending the game. Peter drove his car to the doctor's clinic and after half an hour he arrived and he and his grandmother go above through the stairs to reach the doctor's clinic after they arrived they found that they have to stay aperiod of time to take his turn they waited and then their turn came .they entered the doctor and the doctor was very kind he welcomed them and after check    peter's grandmother. The bench vibrated from the stomping and clapping of the crowd, threatening with every shake to collapse. The starting five for each team walked out to the center of the court for tip off. With the loss of the tip off our team was quickly put under pressure. Transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible Actually, we have a lot of problem with traffic: lots of cars in the railway and it don't running; the number of cars in the street cause a dirty pollution;  crawded railways causes a later destination. People complaint about how the information about different TV shows don't contribute in the process of learning, that's why many of This programmes are considered trash, because of the multiples shows such as realities, talk shows,or showbiz that hardly ever have a good message or something interesting for people. We entered the locker room a moment before my @CAPS3. I took @CAPS1 opportunity to @CAPS2 around at the expressions' of my teammates. Nothing, but disappointment and fear crossed their face's. My town is very beautiful and I like it very much because it is not any dirty streets in it  The governor of my city seek to develop it and he said it will be the capital of delta actually after 30 years ago the people in my town deal with rubbish by healthy method , the citizens collecting the rubbish and threw it in big boxes far away the city. My team had witnessed these acts of rage countless times before. To my surprise, my @CAPS3 entered with complete poise and composure, as @CAPS7 our first @DATE2 of treacherous play didn't phase him. We were not yelled at, or criticized. Instead, he rubbed his eyes, face down and shoulders hunched over. His belly began to shake, shortly followed by his shoulders. My first hypothesis was that he was crying, but then to my amazement, I heard the soft chuckle of our @CAPS3. My favorite sport is swimming.I engaged in swimming in nine years old.I had gotten first prize in a match.As a result,I think that I have some intellent on swimming.Since then,I meet my teacher in the pool.She teach me a lot of things,and be the most important figure in my life.She is a doctor,she told me that swimming will let my body more better.From then on,I fell my disease in decreasind and fell relax.Consequently,I need to swim usually. we bocome not only older but also wiser .we learn but the most useful thing to learn is to get in alot of experiences & for sure to make mistakes .but we have to be honest with our selves by admitting our mistakes to avoid them in the future . for example,using wind Energy or Solar Energy for electricity generation we will be used less fuel what is affected in emissions. Abortion is an immoral act that people make as everyone has a chance to survive and nobody has the right to decide for anyone life.Abortion has to be taken seriously in order to avoid these immoral action as these fetus are being deprive of their right since they have already a life.People had to be sensitize about abortion in order to decrease the number of women being abort.Furthermore,abortion is very dangerous and a great number of women had been death with this.Children has to be protected before and after life,it is why abortion has to be stop First of all, although travelling by car  become more convenient,   the growing population which cause personal vehicle is hard to manage.The traffic jam  becomes more and more serious as far. My name is shousheng and live in Montreal Canada.Alrough Canada is an English country however in Montreal, the offical language is Freach. Even @CAPS7 it wasn't related to basketball, the point was clear. Mohammed is a kindly prophet born in small city called mekka and travelled to another city closed to mekka called almadina cause the people of mekka were very aggressive and they not accepted the new Invitation for the new religio Mohammed came back to his town mekka after that and forgave the people of mekka whose abused him At the end, the kind of live that we will see in fifty years from now will have a lot of stuff to help the people to have a more comfortable, easier and faster way of live, but this will be only to meke more money and consume more and more, also the things will be faster of waste to make the people to change their apparel more often and create a consumerism. The film is a romantic movie, It is talking about one man, Noa, who lives in a small shore town when he felt in love with a rich girl, but like always the girl´s parents did not like Noa´s life because the girl´s father thinks that Noa is not enough good for their daughter. The speech @CAPS3 @CAPS4 gave eased us all. The confident team we should have been from the start of the match was now prepared to win the @DATE2. Here are some tips about the Egyptian people  they are so kind ,friendly,stressed but have a lot of  problems now days the level of poverty, standard of level ,the fixed cost  is increasing dramatically and the purchasing power is decreasing. They are called below: 1- chaharshanbeh soori 2- Norouz 3- sizdehbedar  chahrshanbeh soori:  It meaning Tuesday night of week and take place on last Tuesday night of the year .at this night people make a bonfire and jump over the fires and say to fire :I give you my sign of sickness(yellow color)and you give me your healthy sign (red color)and eat some special foods . We played with such assertiveness and confidence that @CAPS7 @CAPS5 were to compare one @DATE2 with the other, it would @CAPS2 like two different teams. Last month,my friend came to Korea and visited me.In the morning We went to Ocean Park ,we saw dolphin,cat, horse and many animals .In the afternoon we went to play rollar coatser,I screamed on top of voice and called for help .Actually I hate playing rollar coster .We played mind train ,punch and a lot of games .At the end of the day I was just like running out of gas ,because I was too tired to walk any further. The village I live, there is a lot of vegetation for that reason we try to protect environment, some of the things we do is to give mantainance every week to the vagetation zone checking if there is any garbage, to avoid this we teach the younger´s enviromentalist actions so they don´t throw cans,paper,or,candies to the floor they also can help the older people, there are cases which a person throws garbage to the street´s,floor or to the vegetation to avoid that happening again we have a punishment that is to pay some money if the don´t they wont be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again, unless they were visitors, in that case we told him or her the way we live in the village and, we give him or her advises to keep a beautiful place without garbage. In my school ages I did not participate any programme even sports.Because school teachers never encourage me to participate.If they told me to attend compulsory I will do without any hesitation. I looked at: the crowd, score board, opponents, referees and news reporters. There was a island that each year in some moth come a hurricane this island is located  in a equator then the people went to this island currently but they can´t went when the hurricane is there because they can dead in the hurricane. All the distractions easily make @CAPS5 forget the main purpose of why @CAPS5 play the game. think has a future that all people use public transport then I think that maybe continue to have future but has bad and good things , for example good is easier to move in the city and you save time, and the bad , bad people attack you and steal things, but I thing ,that have future ,because a lot people even they use public transport to. Without that reassuring laugh, my team never would have united, and defeated our opponent."	1

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Technology advance way to fast and it is really difficult guessing what kind of stuff or artefacts will be fifty years from now, but we can guess some ideas like flying cars, smartphones with the size of a small paper, laptops really thin like quarter of inch, clothes that clean itself or change the color and shape, healthier food, smarter electrodomestics. Computers allow someone from a faraway place to talk to another person who they can’t see in person, they allow you to get work done in a quicker manner. As well, we have to promote that the people get jobs close their accommodation or get the accommodation close to the jobs, because we have too much pollution and we could reward the companies that hire staff close to the place of job, maybe in a circle of 4 kilometres, as well we could reward the people that turn their accommodation for live near to the job or for going  there by a bicycle. my advice is be patient, be smart this sport not easy but it's need more trainee, more time to be one of the greatest player in the game Computers enable us to communicate with them through email or video chat without the hefty price. Because of computers, talking to your faraway family is a few clicks away. And to day is necessary because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversation with their you need to now more than your foreign language, because in the rest of the world and particularly in Europe people now more than two language and that great. Computers only make doing your work easier and faster. People can travel through the city easily and safely.For instance Melbourn,the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area.Therefore people don't need to drive cars for travelling in the city.The last point is people go for long journey by public transport.Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive. Travelling by car is much more convenient but all know really there is no future for public transport.When we talk about public transport,there are many people and everyone travel but i think we do not feel relax are there and if we talk about travelling by car.It is the best or much more convenient for us.Because we can travel any where but in public transport we can not travel to any other sites The reason is the next, three days ago, he was working when a girl of his job asked him whether he had girlfriend and he told, I had one, come on you know my ex-girlfriend then she only walked without tell nothing. She always tell me some jokes but some times i laughed !,i love her so much,i don't know how will my world being like without her and i won't to know . If it wasn’t for this source of technology, you would be left to do what? He is hobbies  listen to music, play  computer game, watch the football match and watch  TV. Without computers, everyone would not be able to get the education that they have a right to. Micheal was afraid he was waiting for sara to get out he went to the shore to look if she went from the other side but he found no footprints.his mother called him he went home and still thinking about sarah.it was night and ge was afraid ti get there again.he went to sleep .michael closed the door and knew at this moment he had made a mistake. These technological devices have enabled to us to get our work done in a timely matter to receive the grade that we deserve. For one, the show played on television may enlight us and give us some enlightenment.Teleplay are not just for fun,it can have a deep meaning,short story tells big deal,just like a useful book.So,why not television cannot educate us? Without this gadget, we could not be able to live the life we have @DATE1, a life that can get us to where need to be."	1

"There are a few people are using puplic transport, like students and someone had low income.in my veiw, i can say might be the puplictransport going to e close because nobody is going to beclose I believe that computers do not benefit society. I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens.So I do not agree with this afirmation, in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport.

All we have to do is instead of sitting for hours staring at a screen.

Family and friends should be a very important thing in your life but unfortunatly, for most people it is not. But I think that the future is the public transport, we need preserve nature, this is an imperative for our world, then the solution have to take the point that the governments do more invest in public transport, so the people don´t need to get a car for being able to have a job and don´t need it for normal development of their lives. First of all,tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world.Alongside with its development,the ablity of travalling has easened to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another.The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism,as well as with the idea of globalisation,since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen.

Without computers our society would not be so far advanced. Being social is an important quality in life. the main way of being social these days, other than texting, is to chat online with friends. Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and skype all give their users the ability to make new friends, find long lost friends, and chat with friends. I personally have a skype and facabook, and I am able to access them everyday. Without them, I wouldn't be able to chat with friends out of school except for sports and texting.

Education plays a key role in society and if we did not use computers out education that we would receive would not be the same as it is now. My last reason why i believe that computers play a positive role in society is that computers are what keeps businesses running. Without computers some businesses would be unable to function, and those could function, would be awful slow. Since our society is so far advanced our businesses need computers in order to complete the jobs. Expenses and income are saved to businesses computers, if that was all done an paper they could be lost or ruined. I think in the future don't exist public transport because we will drive their car.When you drive your own transport ,a car for example, you going to from a specificlly place but in a bus you go to the bus stop and no to your house or school, work... It is better from the people be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person.

My favorite way to travel is the Plane because  I like to be fast and in my life, I hate a wait in my opinion the plane is the best for me for example when you want to go  somewhere you need to reach there so quick , you don't need to take time and The plane is the best travelling in the world that the best safer than other way  , you can see on the pollution of people who got an accident , how often an accident happen by the plane so anyway if it's happen,i can't imagine it , Eventually I wish everyone who like to travel is safe and sound and safe journey. Only if the government develop more technical property,pay more attention to the environment protection ,such as build more trees and grass in the cities ,and set a special low for those missed animals will help decrease the harm that the building project brings to us. I reduce use of innecesary power at home, in other words,I turn on light that I need for the while i use it;I take less warm shower; I hit only neccesary rooms.

The One of the most amazing thing that attractive you, is that it has  safari  which is more enjoyable thing ,at the sometime,it is introducing you to a wildlife  without needs to go out from your city.

Computers have software were you can instant message, send emails, or even video chat with that person. Firstly, Django Unchained remembered us the hard life suffered by black people in the past, due to a great introduction without dialogues, where black people were unchained while they came back to be selling to an owner farm, it being matching with an amanzing soundtrack as identity Tarantino´s films. I have @NUM2 aunts that I cannot live without who are @CAPS2 strong base who I cant live without talking to for a day. But, in this moment the people think different, is to start to help the world and  Contamination is big problem for us and the planet. I have joined football-teams which is near to my home, I prefer to this team because of my family is not reach, they can not provide for my transportation fees to go exercises stadium. @CAPS2 last reason is I know we have to admit it computers have made me and your life easier. People can travel through the city easily and safely.For instance Melbourn,the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area.Therefore people don't need to drive cars for travelling in the city.The last point is people go for long journey by public transport.Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive. My favourite sport is playing tennis.I play it three times a week (on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays) in the club of tui.I had been playing tennis from 2 years ago with two of my best friends.I enjoy playing tennis because it is a sport that requires skills, concentration and speed.I am not very good at all but I like to play it with my friends and do matches on Saturdays . Firstly,the growing number of private cars cause the big problem with traffic jam .People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam.That wastes people's time and make people feel exhausted.Not mention to say,it's definitely hard to enjoy travelling in holidays.Secondly,private  cars are the main reason for the air pollution.We should consider the protection of environment for human future,not only care about the convenience we can see for now. I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens.So I do not agree with this afirmation, in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport. Now lets see how has computers not needed our learning ability, contracting others, and last but NOT least made me and yours life better. My studies in tecnologico de Monterrey are demanding and challenging because it has a very high educative score all worldwide, but also has to many good things, for example we have a lot of interchanges all around the world, when you have the opportunity to do an interchange you have to deal with the language and the culture with the other country, that means you have to be responsible for studying the basics things of that country, but all of this is worthwhile because when you are there you have so much fun."	1

After two years that his essay was released, he will understand that his essay was wrong moreover, Michael will want to apologise many people who read his essay thereby Michael now goes home, takes a cup of tea, goes to bed thus Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake That is the location of my university. Hi,I am Amy.I would like to spend two months studying in English,two months doing volunteering in children charity and the least two months travelling in UK.What do you think of my plan?I will not only improve my English skills but also devote myself to get along with children.The most important of all,I will take an adventure to the unknown place in UK.I am looking forward to seeing you soon.I would like to invite you to join the road trip with me.it must be an amazing experience if we are together for this trip.As long as you can go with me just let me know. Therefore, if I could change only one thing about KAIST, I want to change the location of my university. my town tries all the time to make our town more beautiful and comfortable by taking more care of the environment,they provide us by good buses which are friends to the environment and offer the tickets for this buses in a cheap price,they also trying to find the best way to make the rubbish more useful by the recycling,also the people tries all the time to find the best way for keep our village clean;they never throw the rubbish in the streets or the gardens,also they take care of the fuel in their cars to not to be bad for the environment,so,it's our duty to take care of our village and the whole environment beside the government. Often the evolution is return of origins however I hope that the man in the next years will be to don't forget the past. First of all, my university is so far from my house. Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath...deep one and started to dive . i don't know my name .i don't know my age all i know about that i want to be a great woman ,i want the world to hear my voice , to prove that i can do it  i can do any thing  i am not weak i have woman power Of course, there are other ways to go to KAIST that take KTX or SRT. If I ride them, time will be saved, but they are pretty expensive. Secondly, most of my friends are in Seoul or near Kyung-gi do. now days, there are many type of transport in the world ,bus taxi,train but train more conform then else , I always used bus in city. One day I visit my friend Jimmy in New York city, he was a young man who was specialist on trains and tourism, he talked about how the citizens and the commuters move from one place to another, he told me that the grand central terminal was the largest terminal of the city,he show me were the landmarks of the big apple were so sightseers could go,he show me the city and we went to different parts first he took me to Columbus circle in the south west corner of central park were there were the most expensive apartments then we went to the lake were the jogging tracks that circle the lake area popular with early morning visitors,then we went to the museum of natural history that was located near the metropolitan museum of art then I got focal on the subway trains so we went to Grand central terminal when we arrive I was amazed to see many people going to work so he told me that it was conveniently for people to use the train because is very fastest and for the government it was a grat economic business then he told me that one of the characteristics of However, I am in Daejeon, so it is too hard to meet my friends in Seoul. Although my friends sometimes come to Daejeon to meet me, I want to see them more.

First, I can go anywhere in Seoul so fast because of subways and buses. There are also very many places to enjoy. There are many accidentally problems encountered by international students studying in Australia.It is believed that the most important one of the problem is culture barrier.Because of different culture backgrounds,the talking  style of internaional students who come from different countries are various. Because of COVID-19, I can't play there with my friends, but after everything become better, Seoul will be the best place to meet my friends
  In conclusion, I want to change my university's geometrical location because KAIST is so far from my house and my friends, and there are many convenient systems in Seoul. If you are living in big town or small It does matter but one thing should be taking care by the people and organiser of the town, is environment.Global warming  is huge issue in today's date. For example, Daejeon has very many scientific organizations, so we can focus on our research or studies.

I think computers are an amazing breakthrough in modern science. From the beginning of the world till now , human wants the fast income and the easy ways of live , so he tries more and more to find a solution for  his problems by creating a new ways of liveing more easy and more convenient  for him. Computers make school projects so simple I don't know if we could do without. Our social studies teacher @PERSON1 says that @PERCENT1 of his projects involve something on the computer. The internet is a great place to research for big papers and projects. With over thirty-million educational and informational websites, its easy to locate what you need quickly and easily. subsequently,this step is most important.bank note should be inspected.bank notes separated into good and bad if get good quality sheets,the next stage is packaging and distribution.at this stage sheets should be cut into separate bank notes,packed,and dispatched. But I think that the future is the public transport, we need preserve nature, this is an imperative for our world, then the solution have to take the point that the governments do more invest in public transport, so the people don´t need to get a car for being able to have a job and don´t need it for normal development of their lives. Take microsoft @CAPS1 for example: you can make exotic background and texts, as well as unique animations to emphasize or to make it pop right off the page. i know that i am not professional player and i am n't belong to any team  but i like this game .basketball is so simple play but it is need Speed ,concentration and The ability to determine the distances  , it  contains of two team of five player and each team try to get a high point by throwing the ball through the basket. Emailing is quick and easy to tell others what you want to say. Secondly,tourism,especially in developed countries,has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view.There are countries,such as Greece or Bulgaria,in which the econmoy relies merely on tourism.If tourism influences the econmy,it thereby influnces the environment,and if it influences the environment it influences the transport.How?people become more careful at their historcal sites,this way preserving them;Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale:At a small scale,in cities, in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently.At a large scale,people can now travel in almost any possible way:on land,on sea or air.Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations. But, on the other hand, because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable; cars are so many; very noisy, unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth. Because you are the best teacher in the whole world!many of our class classmate really like you too!We know that you are going to teach  Discovery-bay  primary school .My English result is  better once  you taught me I really love you, Ms Cumings!your friend Ms Decock told me that  she is going to Australia ,and I love you two both I hope you that you will come back some times ! Like lets say my dad goes on business to @LOCATION2. We can email back and forth every day. And now with @ORGANIZATION1 (a video chat) you can see the person and actually talk to them like they're back at home. Computers have their advantages but they also have disadvantages. Nowadays public transportation is included almost all around the planet, We can admit that the transport revolution has been plave  in the last century but due to the globalization and technological development, the transport sector is always in a continuos transformation: In the other hand we must remarque how the plane sector has been grown, currently is the most common way of transport for going away and that's also means than the shipping factory has decreaced deeply, in order to let the plane market blomm. But why public transport have no future to stand and keep going?, that's because of the people that changing their mind, they start like having their own way to travel, Privacy also an important reason, people need to have a private means of transportation. Also in the sort way, we should go walking to the destination.icle If we are working with  sameone in the same jobs, and  who lives near or he is our neighbour, we can go to the work in the same car, this way we use less oil. In addition, stress is a clear disadvantage of compete because competitiors are trying to win and this can frustrates.But, some people do not think this like this and take it more simply Finally, I think that to compete in sports has some benefits and disadvantages, but when is controlated there are some benefits that help you to whole you life.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"People have different points of view about the diversity of subjects students take. Good day, My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport, Volleyball one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to practise  this sport 3 times a week since 1980,  the reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as follows : 1- make me fit and healthy  2- classy game no friction between players  3- it exercise all muscles of your body Regarding the above I advice all rookies to start practise this sport and they will get many benefits. Universities which prefer specialized students in one subject argue that focusing on one subject has the advantage of having better expertise. First of all,we should thinking out a design and dicide the background colour and artwork,or even security issues.And then for the preparation of metal plates ,the skilled and machinists is considerate.Nect,printing,sheets of bank notes printed (50 bank notes per sheet)colour on both sides,and specWell,the most important step is inspection,we should printed sheets manually inspected. I agree that communiting by car is easier and faster than most of the public transportation; however, there are serious problems come after it; the amount of vehicles on the roads keep increase and make congestion and pollution which are far more severe than the inconvenience causing by public transportation. public transport has a big role in transportation specially in large cities like Capital city of countries,  using the car some times causes traffic jam if all person uses their own car, to avoid this a good roadways is needed, also the cost of public transportation is lower than private transportation.

Firstly it is clear that more house and transport networks is convenient for our people,what is knowed to us is that the population growth is a big problems,which is needed for more palce to living.And builing more transport networks is also benifit for us,for example ,the high-speed rail can be shorteded our time in traveling.while the animal may not welcome to it, Another ones which were bad sheets and bad bank notes from damaged apparently,would be destroyed securely.This was the whole working process of the bank notes and it was consist of 7 steps. In addition, A general vision on the human innovation show that the majority of people creations have bad effect, this effect exist even in people's lives or themselves. at last I wanna talk about my cousins , I love the most of them especially the cousin in the same age , they are my friends , i love too much ,and also the rest of my family people ,espicially grnerator's owner, start using Canaopies, using very long pipes to get rid off as possible as they can from the polution. However, young students at this time are still inexperienced and don't know exactly what they will learn in college. Universities should provide these students with more opportunities to experience and set up a system to take various subjects. In conclusion, because of the connectivity of subjects and the instability of young students due to lack of experience, universities should encourage students to take various subjects. A number of students change the subjects they are learning and taking at university.

Books, magazines, news papers, and music are a great passing time. many countries are truly started to concern no environment and worried about the globe warming ,In schools teachers are doing their best  to educate children how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy,also they train them how to plant trees in public gardens of their towns ,Although  government strict so many laws and taxes in the people how do not pay their taxes to the council for cleaning of the rubbish from towns and villages,in the biggest polluted city in the world people started to use bicycles and cycling instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city,also they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive. In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that doesn't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used,so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground.

Recently when I was in youtube I saw a movie trailer, the film appeared so good and days later my friends told me if I wanted to go them to the cinema, so I decided to go and luckily they had decided to see the film that days before I had seen. In the present world television is very important.But sometimes it can also affect us in a negetive way..most people around the world can see any news in live.media is more help full for the people .television is also using as a study  material for example smart classes, online courses etc. Now imagine all of those gone from the one place you can get away from screaming children or annoying neighbors: the library. Last month,my friend came to Korea and visited me.In the morning We went to Ocean Park ,we saw dolphin,cat, horse and many animals .In the afternoon we went to play rollar coatser,I screamed on top of voice and called for help .Actually I hate playing rollar coster .We played mind train ,punch and a lot of games .At the end of the day I was just like running out of gas ,because I was too tired to walk any further. First, you should know is the weather, we have a very cold winter and a hot summer compared with the other countries in the middle east.If you want a city with sea you should choose any city in the west or east of Saudi Arabia.Riyadh is the capital City it's in the center of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.All the stores and malls are closed at mid night include the five prays breaks because we need to go for pray for work you need to know what the major you want to work in so I can help you to search for a good job matching you abilities. The song that you have had stuck in your head all day is now no longer online. Its use of certain words are offensive to those with 'sensitive' ears. If I were to walk into a library and find that all the 'offensive' works had been band, I would be shocked. When i was arrived at home, i was started to read the news paper, so i found from there The International Student Magazine have to organize a short story competition, and I decide to call Michael to tell him about this contest. My @CAPS3 @CAPS4 teacher thinks that rap and hip-hop or pop songs are offensive to women and their bodies, but I think that some of those songs hold a different meaning. The story tell us the story of Monica(Scarlett Johansson) and her routine living in ""Cretacro"" an enormous mysterious island located in the Pacific Ocean,the problem starts when Monica fell in love with Martin. Nothing that a teenager or an adult would want to read. This sport cause fresh and jolly me and I think will exercise cause healthy.if you start volleyball, you need a ball and piece of ground that separate with tie. To start with,there are a wide range of troublesome it maybe leadding to this phenomeon.Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the persent day cities are already packed with places of residence,commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce.Additionally, people now continues destroyed more agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their need,which will distory the ecosystem  diversity and biodiversity especially the endangered species. Libraries would soon close because everything is being found as offensive. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately but he forget what he had to do after thinkig he rememebred that he had to visit his grandmother as she was ill and his mother told him that his grandmother wanted to see her doctor and wanted him to take her by his car as adoctor's clinic far from her house  peter decided to go and he drove his car to his grandmother's house in the next street after he arrived, he saw his grandmother was waiting for him on the front of the street he apologized to her and asked her to come to the car, ""never mind "" she told and ride the car beside him . Then ,preparation of mental plates and skilled machinists are the needments.Printing is the next step ,.Usually ,sheets of bank notes printed ,because there are some special require for the printing ,solour of both sides,special ink ,images slightly raised. This town is located in the central zone of the Afghanistan with 4462(km²) space, and has more than seven Million populations, the economic and security situation is not suitable and these factors have directly effect in to the carefulness of environment. That means he is a careless, who always drives too fast  But public transport has advantages: If we uses it is the essential transport to travel. For other hand, People make other inventions for improving the world and reduce pollution, for example, In this time we have created electric cars or organic food, these things are very useful in future, because we will need to reduce pollution."	1
82	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Good morning everyone,today I want to share about is my favorite sport.My favorite sport is football,why I choose it?Well,football is a international sport,people around the world will love it so much!Example like Barclay Premier League,Liga Premier,Fifa World Cup and so on.I believe that's all will delighted us.By the way,my favorite football team is Manchester United,they are brilliant,they have an amazing football players,and they are awesome. Whether we like it or not, computers will be necessary to solve issues of the future. In conclusion the public transport is very good and if it desapear it will be a big problem, is right that some times you need a private transport but apart from that the public transport is very use by people of all ages. The main reason people fear computers is because of the dangers is radiates, which really isn't reasonable, when analyzed closely. According to the problems above mentioned,various approaches that governmentshould be adopted to deal with this problem.first of all,reducing building constructure from now on,planting more trees instead.Sustainadle development should be awaness to all human and start to porteat the environment and preserve the animals. The creator of the haven and the earth, the creator of soles , the one who make earth rotate around it self and around the sun.What we belief as Muslims that, we have created by one who don't have other with him the one who create our father (Adam ) and created from him (Eve) and they were in the Paradise and instructed to not eat from the tree but the Satan deceive them so they brought to this life and generations came from them and had sent the prophet and messengers ( Moses, Jesus, Mohamed, others.. who they worship the same one) with Miracles and evidence of the truth, to guide the people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to the Paradise and who follow other paths which it will guide to the hell. Whether people like the concept or not, computers will be necessity to solve the problems and calamities that will wreak havoc on the world in time. Computers can predict natural disasters, and with that, people in the area of the catastrophe's destination can be evacuated. Lives can be saved. Computers can calculate, pollutional margins, and provide solutions to the large amount of pollution humans release in the air and @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION1 Nature can be spared. Obesity and other thins about help, is a topic very important because the people is dying for this problem.For example, the form to prepare the food, is gonna be dangerous because a lot food have artificial thing that is no good for us. People must adapt to @LOCATION1 technology, or we will fall behind and watch our @CAPS1 slip away. in my personal obinionits better to lern froma teacher not only dat you lern to pronounce the words correctly you also lern from a personwhat is in my opinion way better i thin k we spend enougth time on smart phones so i dont think its the best if we use them to lern as well. Stepping down to a less global level of effects and to a more personal level proves to also be beneficial to humans. Computers in most cases, do better work and create less error than humans themselves. Every month Huang Ji Huang always make a special offer from their cutomer , and for this month Huang Ji Huang will give 20% discount for customer who spend 500 IDR above, for a complete  informatioj you can check it on the website or call the restaurant. I will tell you a review of a thriller, the thriller is Hunger games it is about some capitals and people are choised and play on a game, you have to kill persons for they don't kill you, is a movie that have suspense because you want to know ho survey, in the movie someone love someone and protect each others, is very cute but on the 3 movies they are bad moments with the family, capitals, Friends, etc. As member of the workplace can simply e-mail his employer, informing them of the accuracy and preventing them from putting themselves in danger, or simply preventing men the trouble of a commute to work. Even from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2, with simply the press of ""@CAPS2"", people across the world can be of the accident. Foreign communication, specifically by means of instant messaging can strengthen our tie with other nations, in the fields of both business and government. Although healthy diet is quite expensive young people follow special diet in order to have better body shape or healthy life.Actually modern life affected on our palate changing .Instance some people who work majority of their waking houres prefer to use fast food more.Our commitments imposes us to forget ourselves and our healthy . hello  my name is Mustafa I am 23 years old and I am Student in collage I search for job but I don't find a job I wish that my country become a great country and better and I wish to married who I love her  thank you As i didn’t found nothing, i went to the place he live at and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he care about so as i continued to go to his houes i notice he will alays go to tehe same house so i decidec to follow him to the house and i foun out he was dating a girl she might be his girlfrien so i finally gota an idea, i would drive him crazy just as he did with me, that way she will think he had problems on his mind and left him, but son i thougt about it again and realized that if i did that she will try to help him and they will be more united,  so i decided to drive them both crazy almost at the border of death,  jus as he did with me! Nowadays we use technology in every thing, from educations to making clothes, we use technology everyday and everywhere.Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful,useful and  important for development but todays generation is influenced whit technology that they have stopped to do other activities. As you can see, on even a less global level of use, the computer still proves to have a positive effect on its users. The one thing, parents especially, that fuels the negative opinion on computers is safety and reliability. When these two topics are analyzed, it is so simple to eliminate unreliability and danger of the computer. I used to live for a short time in a place where word recycle was completely ignored but they used to this because that wasn't so rich. First of all,tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world.Alongside with its development,the ablity of travalling has easened to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another.The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism,as well as with the idea of globalisation,since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen. We have Eather first than people thanour house.Eather is our home,we all have to protect it.But now people are distroy it.Just for mony for more house but if we destroy it we will all die our money will gone our house will gone we will have nothing.Beside some people destroy farland to build houses but if one day there is no farmland than what should we eat?Nothing at that time we can eat nothing!So what should we do? I have to say that study another language give you more opportunities  because on these days you need to now other language to look for a work and be more inteligent than your college to take the work and that’s great. Also, of those @NUM2, @NUM4 provide reliable, correct information. Then the engineers call to other sector to ensure the doubt of Atlantis then the professional say that other was correct. i like volei because it was part of my life and of life of my mother, is my favorite sport, but i like over sports too, same i don't play volei because I'm bad, and my friends that know, don't like of  peoples bad of volei.I'm watching they playing, they're really very good, but when play over school, they're very bad In conclusion, computers have a far more positive influence on users than negatives. Computers are the future, and have even proven to save lives. the actions of this film took place in Alexandrie city of Egypt and it talks about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they didn't have much money to produce their own albums , that sort of bands is   famous between the youth and they call it ""under ground bands "" .their songs give a big concenet to the political and social stituation in Egypt and they become famous after the25 january revoulation , why I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society , there is no chance for the youth and if they found it , they face lot of problems to save it and they didn't find time for other activties and in sometimes they worked in thing which  they never learn or love Also, the benefits of @CAPS3, or personal computers, are too large and helpful to pass up. Lastly, when viewed carefully, computers are very reliable, and can be made extremely safe, which eliminates the main fear computers. There are many accidentally problems encountered by international students studying in Australia.It is believed that the most important one of the problem is culture barrier.Because of different culture backgrounds,the talking  style of internaional students who come from different countries are various."	1

I know that I am a suitable person for this job, and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job, because I have been travelled for all the world and in this experience, I have seen in the necesity on work to fiance my journey, so the I have dedicated to work on summer camps, and I have a lot of experience in this. First, communication with other universities is restricted by this location problem. no of all people could afford to make conveyenc by car .car is easy and cozy also but public transprt is fair is much affordable to all clasess of poeple public transport means mainly pubic bus.people used to travell long disistance by publis bus .it is possible to carry large number of people of different places to carry in bus. But I think that the future is the public transport, we need preserve nature, this is an imperative for our world, then the solution have to take the point that the governments do more invest in public transport, so the people don´t need to get a car for being able to have a job and don´t need it for normal development of their lives. Second, students sometimes need to fresh their brains, by playing with other friends. Most of the students drink alcohol with their friends or hanging around the city where the university is located. On one hand you put all your things in the car and drive anywhere you want to, on the other hand if you feel not very well to drive, you have no money to buy a car or the downtown of your city is closed for all the means of transport except for the public ones: tram, bus or trolley bus is your wayout. I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked.Pleasure to work at concerts is when  I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate.The experience  is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert. In a recent time privet transport is more convenient than public transportation,although public transport  like buses, train ,ferries and intercity rail are consuming less time and energy but sometimes its create problems. Sizdehbedar: It means Thirteenth day of spring , on this day people going picnic and spent the day out of  their homes on the nature because they believe that Thirteen number that brings bad luck for them . Almost half of the students and people living around Seoul. secondly these mode of transportation covers      as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routine who travelled by public transportation.as a consquence generally people avoid travelling by public transportation finally i can say that there are various mode of transporotation avaliable  to competition with public transportation."	1

I'll tell you a story happened  at school   as any normal pouring day  when you  teenager in school never ever end, but a one day was the best day from any  other pouring normal day because i learn how  live as powerful smart girl who used to let the other us her because she want to feel needed from my friends but i did not have many friends in school except  ""Michael"". Travelling by car is much more convenient but all know really there is no future for public transport.When we talk about public transport,there are many people and everyone travel but i think we do not feel relax are there and if we talk about travelling by car.It is the best or much more convenient for us.Because we can travel any where but in public transport we can not travel to any other sites pain and gain  This movie is bases quote on quote on a ""true story"" buts obviously director michael bay know for the transformers franchise puts a lot of hollywood into this movie, its about a bodybuilder named daniel lugo who decides to kidnap a rich guy and make him sign away all of his properties, which obviously its not a great plan that backfires on him, and eventualy police get him.

With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of population,many agricultueal land,forest and ocesn had been used to destroyed to build more constructure and transport networks.From my own perspective,I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human  and animals.

You can'@CAPS3 look for that trip of a lifetime in a book. Sure you can find out that @CAPS1 is having that big blowout sale, but you cant search up the best deal.

"the tecnology have chanched the people's life very much.in fact we can think how different is our life respect either to our parents or our grandparents life.for example my parents didn't whacth on tv, because there wasn't any tv on the world when they were young.but it isn't the alone difference:we can think at the mobilefone,the computer ed at least the internet.our grandparents woundn't imagine a strange machine like computer in their life. I believe this is a great thing! In conclusin,the whole part of process is an unreversed schedule.It cosumemed the power which contained the humanity and machinic.Nevertheless,in my opinion the most precious of the revolution is the modern security measure through such a muti-developed society. Spent half an hour after we arrived, started coming everybody, there were many greetings, thanks, hugs, kisses, and then we all went to the table, which was magnificently structured, plenty of food of all kinds, drinks, but we were all waiting for the main course, also the food was magnificent, but the best part was when the couple went to the pool, we were lucky we had an amazing wedding planner who arranged the magnificent and fun activities, he said to the bride and groom enter each an inflatable ball and try walking on the water as long as withstand, and the bride won because the groom slipped and fell after them, out of the ball, fell into the water, and kissed. Negaticvs about the online lerning are dat your not listening to much from ea real person and more from a Computer, if you dont have any listening things in the app you dont lern how to pronounce the words. Secondly, studying in university, I have to live far from house which make me be homesick, sad, and worried I have to live in dormitory with many strange friends, they ‘re very noisy and I have to share my room with my roommates. My cousin @PERSON3, who is a big time baseball player, used to have trouble catching the when he was younger. He kept trying over and over again and never gave up. Then, for his birthday his parents bought him a computer! He was so excited, but when it came to typing papers, he wasn't the best. This experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister (I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money. for carreer has 80% under 26 years old students are taken it, for the age over 49 years old only has 20%people are taken; but if you counper interest, it is totoly different; for under 26 years old have only 10%; but for over 49 years old it has 70%. hello, i want the job for the summer camp i'm looking for children between 8-12 years old i will help to organise sports and evening activities and if you want i could work in the kitchen if i have the job write soon                                                                   victoria ?XD)Cherry blossom is very beautiful but there are so many people.When we went to Sun Moon Lake by cable car,wind is so strong!I felt a little nervous though the scenery amazing.All in all,I stil have a memorable vacation.

First of all, thank you professor to teach in the meantime, the entire course of the learn really benefited, especially in the first meeting, for British English, I still did not really understand, it makes me frustrated, but gradually after I found the beautiful of the language in British English, I think it’s all because of the usual problem of American English, and so I really appreciate that you choose simple  textbooks and it’s easy to learn, and you really very carefully and very humorous, you're always careful in curriculum pronunciation correction for each student, using a variety of reading skills let us immerse them read. Computers have two things in one, you learn to type and help your hand eye coordination. so, on my opinion, even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers I like to play football cause for me, as well as one hobby, is one way to stand out of the world, of the problem that every day I have to face, and at the end it makes me calm and happy. Moreover also simple things are changed, for example the food we eat: some times ago everythingh was natural, healthy... but now everyone eat always ""junk food"" and thinghs like that, which are completely unhealthy ! I also learned about the powerplant explosion in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. How do I know all of this you ask? We can not stop changing but we can guide it to the a special  benefit which it makes the life easier and more comfortable.Using the changing method would improve the education system in many aspects especially for people with obstruction. But, i'm not the only one who has gained this knowledge from the internet, so many more have too. @ORGANIZATION1 took a poll about how many @CAPS3 use the computer to do research and @PERCENT2 answered that they did. Does the society really want to take away @CAPS3 knowledge of whats going on around us and our history? According to the information donne, the most used is the car thus most of the families has one, but the public transportation is getting more and more common for those ones who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectfully with the planet. This is great if you haven't seen them recently, or if you want to just stay in touch. One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance,  homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society. Negaticvs about the online lerning are dat your not listening to much from ea real person and more from a Computer, if you dont have any listening things in the app you dont lern how to pronounce the words. We talk about visiting each other and how our family's are doing. But, you can also talk to your friends too. Studies show that @PERCENT3 of @CAPS3 between the ages of eleven and eighteen talk to their friends over facebook on a daily basis. Dr. @PERSON2, a teen psychiatrist, says ""I think this is a great idea for @CAPS3 to communicate with other @CAPS3 through the computer. Only if the government develop more technical property,pay more attention to the environment protection ,such as build more trees and grass in the cities ,and set a special low for those missed animals will help decrease the harm that the building project brings to us. @CAPS3 have such a good lifestyle for them, do you want to feel guilty for ruining that? Finally, people have perfect opportunities right in front of them. For another,there are many different types of programs,which can broaden our eyes,they give details of education,plus other meaningful information，such as documentaries，talk show and so on.These programs are not just for killing the time,but for educating.

88	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @CAPS1: People are spending far to much time on computers. To sum up, do sports is very important for teenagers to which the body is going to grow and do it regularly is commitment that we should take. Just think about it anything you can do on a computer you can do without a computer. That and pepole need to spend mor time outside expiriencing nature. One day many years ago in something place that a don't remember the name I woke up one morning more earlier than usual then I went to the kitchen and shout the name of my mother...but no one answered, and the first thing that I imagine is that they come to the town, quickly I went out to find they... But there was no one, absolutely no one, I'm scary, I yell and scream, look and look but I had no result  Suddenly I felt a warm hand that touched my shoulder and very slowly turn but the only thing I saw was a shadow that was holding a knife     I woke up and realised it had all been a bad dream I chalenge you to name one thing you can do on the computer that you can't do without. You can't even name one. I  like to spend time cute little kids and  cooking is my favourite hobby.In the evening I would like to spend some time with those kids by organising some indoor and outdoor games for them.I would feel more energtic throughout the day If I have some busy or tight scheduled work,I have come across your advertisement For this job and I really think that I would suit this job in every aspect because I have a friendly move with people in and around me.I would be pleased to know for your positive reply. Everyone eagerly waiting for the ambulance arrival but still not yet reached the reason is our college location is little far from the city that's why it is getting late. To find out about current events you can read the newspaper or watch the news. If you like using computer disign programs try drawing a real picture instead. Lastly if you download a lot of music you can just but a cd or better yet go to see the band live. Face it you can't do ehything on a computer that actualy requires the computer. Artificial simulations are no mach for the real outdoors. And to day is necessary because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversation with their you need to now more than your foreign language, because in the rest of the world and particularly in Europe people now more than two language and that great. Outside you can the gentel breses the warm sun the cool grass, you can smell fresh pine and clean air. No all is good some people haven't got money can't go to another place to another place and the pollution became more and more, it is a serious problem and the solution is only for the rich people, the solution is buy an electric car, the other solution, more economic, is the government give the money to the population to buy an electric car. the tecnology have chanched the people's life very much.in fact we can think how different is our life respect either to our parents or our grandparents life.for example my parents didn't whacth on tv, because there wasn't any tv on the world when they were young.but it isn't the alone difference:we can think at the mobilefone,the computer ed at least the internet.our grandparents woundn't imagine a strange machine like computer in their life. Our Mistakes mistake made us better than before if in life we had't got any mistake  we wouldn't succeed that's why  the mistakes are very important in life and I believe  our mistake improve us so but in another way there just one mistake and you could not come back or arranged your mistake Can't you see how great the outdoors are? Computers can do more harm than good. Last month,my friend came to Korea and visited me.In the morning We went to Ocean Park ,we saw dolphin,cat, horse and many animals .In the afternoon we went to play rollar coatser,I screamed on top of voice and called for help .Actually I hate playing rollar coster .We played mind train ,punch and a lot of games .At the end of the day I was just like running out of gas ,because I was too tired to walk any further. Today, we have more item to recycle as long as we clean properly and put in a proper bin, which will be use it by specialized factory in another item. First of all,friends are important for us,we want a friend that we can share our secrets and problems.But friends maybe in the future go away or hurt you!So you can't always based on them!For example,they need you until they find someone better than you and in the end they go away.But family never let you go or family never go away from you! First of all, thank you professor to teach in the meantime, the entire course of the learn really benefited, especially in the first meeting, for British English, I still did not really understand, it makes me frustrated, but gradually after I found the beautiful of the language in British English, I think it’s all because of the usual problem of American English, and so I really appreciate that you choose simple  textbooks and it’s easy to learn, and you really very carefully and very humorous, you're always careful in curriculum pronunciation correction for each student, using a variety of reading skills let us immerse them read. They do this by pretending to be the childs peer then using the information the child him he will make almost a garunteed kidnapping. Otherwise the public transport don't pollute but the car pollute so for us travelling by car is better than travellng by public transport but for the atmosphere is better travelling by  public transport than travelling by car The computer isn't as helpful as you thought. Then if you want we could go to the restaurant of the city later if you want we could fiand a job for three months, in my opinion a good job for three months I could be the waiter because the waiter get much money in the three months of the summer.

If difficulties was told to the families, the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation. Lastly they can be eisily used for bad even ilegal purpuses. One night,as usual,I slept.In a flash,I rolled down from a mountain and I didn't know where I was.It just a very long tunnel where was dark and strange,After,I felt my body ache.I began to yell that hoped someone could  save me to leave from here."	1
89	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"When alison knock on his parents door she noticed that there were many people in her parents house, a man open the front door.When she entered  the house ,a man was looking at her with a bad face,when suddenly this man shot with a gun to Alison father. Let's see some reasons. IN my country peole do alot of mistake and have alot of of bad habits concerning their attitude towards the rubbish ,they are always throwing their old things and rubbish in public place ,the governement also cannot do their role towards their people and their bad behaviour For example, one of my college friends has a part-time job for her tuition. By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we don't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars don't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport. Secondly, we can have lots of experience about many jobs before we have our own job. the actions of this film took place in Alexandrie city of Egypt and it talks about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they didn't have much money to produce their own albums , that sort of bands is   famous between the youth and they call it ""under ground bands "" .their songs give a big concenet to the political and social stituation in Egypt and they become famous after the25 january revoulation , why I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society , there is no chance for the youth and if they found it , they face lot of problems to save it and they didn't find time for other activties and in sometimes they worked in thing which  they never learn or love Thirdly, having a part time-job is important for college students to have socialization. In conclusion, we are assisting to a new tend in transport, every time, they are faster and more developer, with the latest technology included but at the oppossite case, we find also a contradiction, as we found an other trend for the tradictional transport which avoid the pollution in order to respect the Earth As far as I know it's very important to meet many kinds of people as long as one has breath, so they can meet many kinds of people when they have part-time jobs. The service is very bad the drivers are very angry and stressed out these do not lead with cauition, in Toluca exist report of high rates of accidents by buses."	1.5

In case of transportation technology, in this twenty first century we have various option like Plan that can fly with the cloud, train that fast and big enough that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time.

Another way computers are beneficial is they bring everyone together. But, the public transportation have a lot of future bacase a lot of reassons, first the time, if the place you want to reach finally is really far the different type of vehicles of public transportation will get you there faster than your car, also the complications about the field, like if you want to go from America to Europe there is no highway that cross the ocean you need an airplane and unless you have one, you will cannot reach travel between continents with your car, a different reasson is politics, because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska you will not need to pass through Canada, the commodity is a really important reasson because drive for 8 hours is exhausting and it will be unsafe also, the economics is a factor to, because the attrition of your car it will be more that in the normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do, it will be expensive that in public transportation.

92	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"finally ,a public transport need more costs , because public transport (such a buses , train ) fees every year is increasing, and this problem we do not face it by private transport , Authors are artists. Writing is a form of expression. I don't think there is no future for public transport.Especially in urban, for example, Taipei city in Taiwan.People who lives there almost know the convenient public transport called MRT, it's fast, cheaper and doesn't have to find the parking lot. I do not think we should deny anyone that freedom. The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years No matter what year, its lowest level always in Jan-Mar.May be because this paragraph of time the weather was cold, the purchaser greatly reduced.We can be seen from the diagram,  the highest peak in the has increased year by year, as the low as. People want to keep children neive, they want them to stay innocent. There was a island that each year in some moth come a hurricane this island is located  in a equator then the people went to this island currently but they can´t went when the hurricane is there because they can dead in the hurricane. They will be curious. They will want to know. Michael and Kate was so  happy, until one day that Michael said to him dream to be a super hero, Kate get so nervous saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid dream and that Michael was only dreaming but that would never happen and that super hero don’t exist. Someday he woke up early at the morning he go out for playing football before school, when he's playing he saw something running very fast and go away. One day Penny discovered it and it go to tell it to his queen, the queen at knowing that she get very confused but at the same time she get mad and she wanted revenge. There is so much that children, and just normal people would miss out on if we took down every thing that someone said was 'offensive'. ""As you well know, rose's life is your hands"" she said and keep talking:""...You are the only one, that can save her life, but before you must comply with your promise"". On one hand you put all your things in the car and drive anywhere you want to, on the other hand if you feel not very well to drive, you have no money to buy a car or the downtown of your city is closed for all the means of transport except for the public ones: tram, bus or trolley bus is your wayout. Nowadays a person's worth seems to be judge  according to the social status and material possessions, that is mostly to happen in high class famiies, as they are foccus on achievements as power, political influences etc. Michael is a good boy and he always listen to his mother .on time Michael was very angry as he got a bad score in his test .when he was home his mother was cooking she asked him what is the wrong ? Because everyone has a different oppinon.

If you want we could go to the capital city of my country, we will go by the car because the car is cheaper than the bus or train, we could eat in the famous restaurant of the city or we could go to the cinema also if you want I could visit the medieval wall. To each his own. Different people like different things. in my personal obinionits better to lern froma teacher not only dat you lern to pronounce the words correctly you also lern from a personwhat is in my opinion way better i thin k we spend enougth time on smart phones so i dont think its the best if we use them to lern as well. Volleyball its my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I were in another world, in which I can be free and happy, apart of this, when I am bad, this is a distration of the university. Books, music, movies, they are all art. Good day, My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport, Volleyball one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to practise  this sport 3 times a week since 1980,  the reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as follows : 1- make me fit and healthy  2- classy game no friction between players  3- it exercise all muscles of your body Regarding the above I advice all rookies to start practise this sport and they will get many benefits. We already censor so much. I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked.Pleasure to work at concerts is when  I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate.The experience  is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert. If you do not perticularly like something, then it is your choice to not read it. Even though do not everyone doing that,so how much public office is care of environment is important and this town is care of that a lot.Every morning some peasons are coming park and cleaned that makes feel really thanksgratitude. You can choose for your children, but you can not choose for others. People have a right to do what they want. Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath...deep one and started to dive . I think that the  public  transport always going to be so important in our life  because  not all the people have the possibility to buy a car because the public transport is more expensive than a car, so for that reason the public transport in the future  could be exist, because public transport is a necesity in all the world not only for the money but too for the facility to take a bus or any other public transport They have a right to create what makes them happy. I don’t like Narnia, but my favorite movie is probably 22 jump street, Lord of the rings, The tv-show: suits, The walking dead and maybe south park and family guy. Books do not kill people. Music does not kill people. They can make you uncomfortable. They can even make you sick or angry, but they do not harm anyone. Secondly,tourism,especially in developed countries,has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view.There are countries,such as Greece or Bulgaria,in which the econmoy relies merely on tourism.If tourism influences the econmy,it thereby influnces the environment,and if it influences the environment it influences the transport.How?people become more careful at their historcal sites,this way preserving them;Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale:At a small scale,in cities, in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently.At a large scale,people can now travel in almost any possible way:on land,on sea or air.Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations. The other chart is about employer support, under 26 years old is the most higterst because it almost have 70%, the scentd higterst is age 26-29 years old; it has 50% of people are taken; niy yhe most lower is 35% age of group are 30-39 years old. It gives the students the freedom to choose his major and the teachers.In addition, it has a lot of facilities that serve students like kindergarten that takes care of children these employees, university housing, hospital the student of medicine can be application in it and it serves the people too, and a big library has many books in various languages. All in all, I do not believe any books, music, movies, or any other forms of art should be romoved from the shelves. There could be age limits for certain things, or specific sections for more adult things, but I do not believe any @CAPS3 should have the choice to decide what is right for someone else. It is very difficult to deny the importance of family in our life,  definitely families play an essential role community structure .According to the experts we can't create  successful society without creative families , and one another specific part of your life is a good partners surrounding your daily activities. I had a terrible experience in this Chinese New Year!Because Norovirus infected me!At first,I had a high fever but I thought if I take some medicine I will be fine.Therefore,my condition took a sharp turn for the worse.I cannot eat anything even in New Year's Eve and I was so tired that I cannot play poker with my cousins.Though everythings were depressing,I still have a wonderful winner vacation with my family:we went to  Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village(九族)to visited its blooming cherry blossom. But please do not take away an oportunity for another. A wonderful book, or a life-changing peice of music could be taken away from someone, because you found it 'offensive'."	1.5
93	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"I agree with the statement. College students are mostly in their 20s and are adults with a social life that requires money, such as going out for dinners or shopping for clothes. Them they drink a cafe that give them many energy to construct faster the building, this café has a combination for the people can to live all the night. Further to the trade fair of the last week where we were a pleasure to meet you and we were talking about you courses. I played so good that everyone gave me congratulations but thats not all one of the best team of the world wanted too take me. I want to turn to his hobbies, when he isn't working, he is riding on a bike, every evening he takes the bike and rides across some paths for more than forty kilometers by day, so he is very good rider and its quite strong to ride with him. Part-time jobs that enable flexibility are providing tuition or working on an ad-hoc basis such as modeling or screen-writing. I therefore conclude that it is imperative that college students have a part-time job in order to keep up with their social lifestyles and not burden their parents, some of whom may already be retired."	1.5
94	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to you to let you know my opinion on computers and technologies. In my opinion, Family is the place that had you best friend can help each other and know each.In the Taiwan,many of people have to take care of them parent when they get old,but the point is what if you can not survival,I mean you don't have enough money to raise you parent.Back to the topic,I don't know well any of member of in my family,I don't trust them,honestly. One computers let you surf online anytime you want. Two, computers allow people talk online. First reason why computers are so critical in our culture is that computers let you surf online anywhere and anytime you want. This is very convenient. But today, Things are getting change and technology marked a significant role in our life, Automobile segment increased its vertical and having a car becomes a need from luxory. To our relief,she was saved and when we went to granny room,we saw smile on her face.We were also happy,but in Michael head came a lot of things.He knew that if we escape at that moment when the granny was at the ground,she would most probably die.Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. People complaint about how the information about different TV shows don't contribute in the process of learning, that's why many of This programmes are considered trash, because of the multiples shows such as realities, talk shows,or showbiz that hardly ever have a good message or something interesting for people. Her mother could drive her ther, but what if she wasn't at home or driving someone else to a doctor's appointment?

Jane can just simply go online and do the research! Other reason for my opinión is that almost all the people preffer use the visual sense and ear to other person more than write and listen for understand new things. hello  my name is Mustafa I am 23 years old and I am Student in collage I search for job but I don't find a job I wish that my country become a great country and better and I wish to married who I love her  thank you But in some country, You can use underground (metro) , it is very advanced than old types like Bus or Taxi,The underground is faster and clean and arranged .

Although with internet, I can talk to my family whenever I want! Also, you can video chat with your lab partner to discuss how you can make the lab report better! @PERSON1, the author of ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"" also states in his book that over @NUM3 million people use internet to videochat for educational purposes. In conclusion, ivideochat @MONTH1 sound like something to do for lark, but it is actually used for many good purposes. In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life, but majority of ones is totally utopic. This is due to Lima in the beginning  has not had a pant to desing its public road s and highways, and it only has been improvising to build their way without any criteria to transport its population. Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath...deep one and started to dive . Just because we use computers to make our life easier, it does not mean that we don't value spending time with family. I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked.Pleasure to work at concerts is when  I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate.The experience  is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert."	1.5
95	"Government: Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.    "	"Sizdehbedar: It means Thirteenth day of spring , on this day people going picnic and spent the day out of  their homes on the nature because they believe that Thirteen number that brings bad luck for them . In Seoul, nearly 10 million people live there. Including floating population, the amount will be much more. Since cities these days have a large population and complicated structures, well-constructed traffic systems are highly required. One day I visit my friend Jimmy in New York city, he was a young man who was specialist on trains and tourism, he talked about how the citizens and the commuters move from one place to another, he told me that the grand central terminal was the largest terminal of the city,he show me were the landmarks of the big apple were so sightseers could go,he show me the city and we went to different parts first he took me to Columbus circle in the south west corner of central park were there were the most expensive apartments then we went to the lake were the jogging tracks that circle the lake area popular with early morning visitors,then we went to the museum of natural history that was located near the metropolitan museum of art then I got focal on the subway trains so we went to Grand central terminal when we arrive I was amazed to see many people going to work so he told me that it was conveniently for people to use the train because is very fastest and for the government it was a grat economic business then he told me that one of the characteristics of One day a man and his wife were trying to found a place shallow and without pollution for cultivate, they were poor; they don’t have the necessary sources, but the husband work so hard because his wife had an accident it occurred one day that his wife was working in a campaign of conservation of animal in endangered, she went to a place in search of animals, she heard a sound in a dark place of the jungle so she went to investigated what was that, a creature that have never seen attack she, her partner only heard a shout and they found Lucy the wife of the man in the floor, they ask she if she is ok but he don’t answered so her partner toke it to the doctor, there the doctor said that she was ok but he will never hear again or only if she paid 1 000 dollar for a operation. First of all, expanding public transportation is far more effective in improving traffic systems. We have a lot of shopping facilities, it is the good thing about living in a big city like Madrid, because we have a lot of different shops since clothes shops, pets shops, food shops, shoes shops, accessories shops, toys shops, presents shops and much more types of shops that know I can not remember, but you can find almost all you want or you need it is not incredible? This is due to Lima in the beginning  has not had a pant to desing its public road s and highways, and it only has been improvising to build their way without any criteria to transport its population. In addition, constructing public transportation is good for the environment. Buses, trains, and subways can pick up a lot of people at once; therefore, they use less fuel if they are established successfully. Furthermore, environmentally friendly vehicles such as electric motor vehicle can be used for public transportation if promoted by cities. Since cities should pursue sustainable development, public transportation must be improved more. Others argue that roads and highways should be expanded since there are still numerous traffic jams. I can tell you that I fell I can understand over 90% when I'm listening and when I´m Reading, but my main problem with English is of course when I must speak: I fell my self horrible without confidence, I think that always I'm thinking in Epanish and after makind the translation to English, may be in this moment when I'm writing this composition I'm making the same wrong. firstly, that private transport provide a comfortable mean to travelling from one place to another without sharing stranger people a way and by using this kind of transport also comfortable in free with choosing time of a trip. Mohammed is a kindly prophet born in small city called mekka and travelled to another city closed to mekka called almadina cause the people of mekka were very aggressive and they not accepted the new Invitation for the new religio Mohammed came back to his town mekka after that and forgave the people of mekka whose abused him Thus, expanding public transportation is far more appropriate for relieving traffic jams than expanding roads and highways. To sum up, since public transportation is effectual in enhancing traffic systems and eco-friendly, governments should spend more money on improving it.

96	Lifetstyle: Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"First of all,tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world.Alongside with its development,the ablity of travalling has easened to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another.The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism,as well as with the idea of globalisation,since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen. Some say getting up early and starting the day's work as soon as possible is better since it will make work end early and have free time in the afternoon. Secondly,Closed trash bins provided to the people in order to collect the waste and recycling.People come forward and utilising this bin effectively instead of throwing away.As a result of this town looks clean compare to previous decades. In my opinion, waking up earlier in the day and starting day's work early is better for several reasons. First of all, starting work earlier can give free afternoon time after work has ended. Since work hour for a day is normally fixed, starting early means ending earlier; for example, starting work 1 hour earlier will make work end 1 hour earlier. By ending work before dinner will allow on to have free time doing variety of activities that can only be done at daytime such as having time with friends or family, playing some sports, and playing instruments. These kind of activities can only be done at daytime, and early ending of work will let one enjoy these after work. In addition to having free time, waking up earlier will make life routine more stable and avoid unhealthy lifestyle. Then peter stared "" happy birthday my lovely sister"" peter said and gave here key of a car Sara was so amazed and hug here brother and grateful him . Already public transport have been improvement and that makes comfortable to go on a trip,but I think that will be able to become good quality more and more,because so many people expectation. Also, people will try to get to sleep earlier through exercising, listening to calm music, and meditation. All of the things I listed above will help a person build healthier lifestyle that will contribute to happy and healthy life. This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. The government can to improve the public transport making a great investmenting like changing the old vehicles for new and increase the number the bus, trains and build more bus station and trains station this kind the action will help a lot the quality of the public transport for population and will become the life of the people more easy. after two days poleas sow some boody in crime scene the poles man ask them what did you do hear ? Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real. Meanwhile, different countries have different rules.For example,people always walk on the right of the road in China .However ,Australian’s rule specify citizen drive on the left of the road.Secondly,loneliness would be a big problem when a person who leave their own country getting away from family members and close friends.Thirdly, students can’t be accustomed to western eating habits like burgers,pizza and bread .According to the unfamiliar environment students may lack the sense of security.There will evaluate viable solutions to the problem.The most important way is that individuals should participate in student activities which held by the students from the same nationality so that they may not feel lonely .At the same time they can also actively communicate with local students to acquire more information  about  Australia culture  in order to suit quickly. To sum up, the lifestyle of waking up early and starting work morning will make life much enjoyable and healthy in multiple ways. It will offer free time when sun is still up, allowing many activities that can be done at day. people that they play in this categorie are fameous althoug you can see them on tv.if you want to be a big football player you must to practise more time and yoor life should to be healthy."	1.5

The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots. I don´t have friends who like swimming, almost like football or similar teams sports, and always I go alone it isn´t boring for me furthermore, I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I haven´t wait anybody. But two years ago, everything changed; and it seemed as though it wasn't for the better. Good Morning: This is an esay about my favourite sport,it is swimming since I was a child because always enjoy a lot and what is more I can do it alone, I never refuse to go swimming pool and less in summer, of course. Recently when I was in youtube I saw a movie trailer, the film appeared so good and days later my friends told me if I wanted to go them to the cinema, so I decided to go and luckily they had decided to see the film that days before I had seen. As I talked to my friends and family about it, I learned to live with the fact that my family would never be the same again. This sport cause fresh and jolly me and I think will exercise cause healthy.if you start volleyball, you need a ball and piece of ground that separate with tie. But the times when I was with my best friends and caring family, were the times that I forgot about all of the things going on at home. Looking for any sport make you feel good and your brain be always refresh so that you  can begin your day with any sport to making fresh and after that you can make any job with refreshment mind. We are inseparable. Some public transports  as trains do not contaminate as cars or motorbikes.Many people said that public transport is not confortable, thats true, from my point of view bus is not so unconfortable. He knows me better than anybody else. We talk every day at school, we text message each other every night, and hang out almost every weekend. The night that my parents told me they were getting a divorce I called him crying. in my personal obinionits better to lern froma teacher not only dat you lern to pronounce the words correctly you also lern from a personwhat is in my opinion way better i thin k we spend enougth time on smart phones so i dont think its the best if we use them to lern as well. They are called below: 1- chaharshanbeh soori 2- Norouz 3- sizdehbedar  chahrshanbeh soori:  It meaning Tuesday night of week and take place on last Tuesday night of the year .at this night people make a bonfire and jump over the fires and say to fire :I give you my sign of sickness(yellow color)and you give me your healthy sign (red color)and eat some special foods . He and I would joke about all my problems. To some, that @MONTH1 seem a little strange; but it was almost therapeutic to me. Making fun of my life, made it easier to live it in a sense. At first and important change is about eating prepared food that isn't healthy usually,its reason probably woman's life stile that is going to big change in the way that they don't like staying at home and spend their time to making food ,now they prefer to buy prepared good. The television is one of the most important AV media in the world.You can use it for many purposes, according  to your needs .There are a lot of channels in many roles,for instance , education , movies, songs ,sports,news and so on .The television is not only for entertainment but also for education .The television can entertain you through it's entertained channels, and the television can educate you through it's educational channels. A girl always needs another girl in her life to tell secrets, to do crazy things, and to lay on the couch all day watching sappy love movies with. For me, its @CAPS1. first we uses Internet to discover the world's news, from Internet we can check and read world's most famous newspaper such as new York times, the sun and also electronic newspaper.Internet also can be used to learn and to educate yourself, internet allow us to read books, magazines and short stories.Internet is the most effective way to start a business and to look for a job, many people uses Internet to work , and they earning money every month.Internet is a way to make new friends all over the world through social websites such as Facebook,twitter, and you tube.As a conclusion internet is making things better and easier, life now is always connected to the Internet. In this view, I consider, though, there is lots of sports on Televison, they are not too much, because the people have looke for it. According to the information donne, the most used is the car thus most of the families has one, but the public transportation is getting more and more common for those ones who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectfully with the planet. Strange things happen in the house, they are ""intruders"" in the house, anne saw many times someone called victor who ""play`s"" and the mother thinks she is lyeing but after a while she believe her and started searching for the intruders. By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we don't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars don't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport. Nowadays we use technology in every thing, from educations to making clothes, we use technology everyday and everywhere.Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful,useful and  important for development but todays generation is influenced whit technology that they have stopped to do other activities. To me, that's a pretty good reason to cry.We re-lived our best moments that night, and we weren't going to let the situation make us upset. We wanted to make our last memory in my house a good one; that we would always remember. My family is quite strange; but we do know how to have a good time. I don't have many family members, but I think that because we are so tightly knit, we get along really well. Them they drink a cafe that give them many energy to construct faster the building, this café has a combination for the people can to live all the night. Elizabeth apparent to be a very sweet girl, but Jason is not convince, because when he kiss her, he doesn’t feel nothing, he doesn’t feel that gravity disappear, and when his face turn red, he just put a face of horror and surprise , like if she was very sorry about kissing him. Nowadays, the transportation become more prefect,and the people'life become more convenient.Althought this change lend the life of people efficient,the problem should not be ignored.It would really be helpful if the government make tighter resrictions,in today's world ,lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission, they are destroyed the forest,farmland and wetland,charging waster water and emitting greenhouse gas,it lead to a serious enviorment problem.So the government should oversee this companies ,and if companies do not obey the rules or laws ,it will be fined and closed. Nevertheless the journalists stay all the time having a photo,all the time,when they eaten, drinking, happy, sad,how is your love life and with whoever stay, if stay with something important our what buy. I have played this sport for twelve years ago this sport has taught me to respect the other not assault to him.there is the only reason that makes me choose this sport is I don't want to be weak I wouldn't like to be nothing in this country that has a rule Strong dominated the weak.when I put my feet in the gym i forget everything shcool,home...therefore I enjoy it.I can't imagine my life without taekwondo it is my blood,my soul.taekwondo it is not a violent sport as many people say but what you have to know is what in the brain and the heart of players.I just get the 1st degree international black belt and I would like to tell to anyone he just starting this sport use your abilities and skills for the right things. People's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years ,Equipment and tools have evolved since the beginning of human history.In recent decades,however, developments have been particularly groundbreaking,Man has been able to invent machines ,which they have been put to work automation is  a great help to mankind,because it significantly increases the standard of living and frees people form hard work.The result is much less work and a better life. In the end, large colleges admit largest number of students, so the student may do establishing friendships more from different nationalities, also it serves the community by graduating many students in various majors. Some say laughter is the best medicine; I say it's love. The other chart is about employer support, under 26 years old is the most higterst because it almost have 70%, the scentd higterst is age 26-29 years old; it has 50% of people are taken; niy yhe most lower is 35% age of group are 30-39 years old. I can honestly say that every one of these people have made me a better person, and I love them with all my heart."	1.5
98	"If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Because you are the best teacher in the whole world!many of our class classmate really like you too!We know that you are going to teach  Discovery-bay  primary school .My English result is  better once  you taught me I really love you, Ms Cumings!your friend Ms Decock told me that  she is going to Australia ,and I love you two both I hope you that you will come back some times ! Everyday I passed that way, I think 'Why establisher make my hometown on mountain?' It is very hard to climb the hill, even on everyday, to go to home. Strange things happen in the house, they are ""intruders"" in the house, anne saw many times someone called victor who ""play`s"" and the mother thinks she is lyeing but after a while she believe her and started searching for the intruders. In fact, it is really hard to choice because hometown is the place where we live very long, so we are already very natural to its conditions, places, and neighbors. But, if you should change one thing about your hometown, what would you change? I'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant its name is ""Lemon"" I go there every week it has different food from any restaurants I'd like chicken crispy with garlic sauce It's Excellent choice for me and My favorite appitizer is susage and in order that desert I'd rather ""Vadge"" cake with chocolate sauce I feel I;m at ease when I go there I enjoy  classical music over having a lunch about the service It's very good and all staff are respectable I can't imagine one week without going there that drives me nuts I advise any one to go there and enjoy  a time there , also this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really It's  excellent This strikingly thing for anyone  despite all of these advantages prices are not expensive . The government can to improve the public transport making a great investmenting like changing the old vehicles for new and increase the number the bus, trains and build more bus station and trains station this kind the action will help a lot the quality of the public transport for population and will become the life of the people more easy. They were talking about their lives and  he remembered like he knew her on the bus, maybe  she have always been the woman of his live he looked at eyes and smile he wants to ask her whether now is not late to satart to know her but he decided leave the pub he walked to exit. This means, hills on my hometown, can effect me and my neighborhoods bad ways. when am in the court other side participants are fear take off my service ball and am very at my position to cover the entire court. The elders argue that they are tired to up and down this hill and feel uncomfortable. For everyone's health, it can not be a good ground structure. In summer, Korea has very high temperature which is almost 40 Celcius degrees. Sun light is too strong, and also aspalt grounds emit heats. As Automotive Industries are huge in market, most of the  house holders  prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time . most of girl doesnt like this,i think that it takes us energy,we need to do exercise,reasonable diet...and so on. After finishing climbing via hills and arriving at home, a lot of sweats is remained. There is no one who likes to go to hard ways and sweats. I used all of the things except two.I didn't have the Internet when I was child.And also we couldn't choose  programmes.I played in the street and walked to school alone.I'm thinking what kind if things were more dangerous for me?It was so dangerous when my friends and I swam in the Tobol river.We jumped into the water and caught crayfish.When I remember that moment I am exciting.I guess everychild want to investigate the world.We have to help them,to show and explain.What kind of risks they can get if to do that. Spent half an hour after we arrived, started coming everybody, there were many greetings, thanks, hugs, kisses, and then we all went to the table, which was magnificently structured, plenty of food of all kinds, drinks, but we were all waiting for the main course, also the food was magnificent, but the best part was when the couple went to the pool, we were lucky we had an amazing wedding planner who arranged the magnificent and fun activities, he said to the bride and groom enter each an inflatable ball and try walking on the water as long as withstand, and the bride won because the groom slipped and fell after them, out of the ball, fell into the water, and kissed. Like people, they also use those hills. But, car on the hill is very dangerous to people. This first reason is all actors shown their talent in this film directly and audience can follow their steps and the story certainly, this essential element which also makes a big success to the film. These two phenomena, limit of driver's view and hard to reduce velocity, can cause accidents that is crashing between people and cars. Firstly it is clear that more house and transport networks is convenient for our people,what is knowed to us is that the population growth is a big problems,which is needed for more palce to living.And builing more transport networks is also benifit for us,for example ,the high-speed rail can be shorteded our time in traveling.while the animal may not welcome to it, In conclusion, there are three reasons, people's knee health, uncomfortable in summer, possibility of occurence of accidents, for my arguement 'hills should be removed on my hometown.' By removing these hills, we can expect effects like decreasing knee patients, and frequency of accidents.

We have Eather first than people thanour house.Eather is our home,we all have to protect it.But now people are distroy it.Just for mony for more house but if we destroy it we will all die our money will gone our house will gone we will have nothing.Beside some people destroy farland to build houses but if one day there is no farmland than what should we eat?Nothing at that time we can eat nothing!So what should we do? Maintaing cars are expensive.Public transport you do not need to worry about any petrol filling, checking tyre pressures, getting tired after driving long journey.In future cutting down public transport affects many of the people.Elderly people wont able to drive always depends on public transport.If public transport stop services people who are not able to drive will  affect a lot.

As every year the twenty three of April, day of book, in my school all the student of fifth and sixth of primary do short story competition and the winner have a gift. In study group, they are stimulated by friends whenever they feel their ability is worse then the colleagues. To remove this kind of feeling, the students will study harder. There is a man who is most important for one's life.I am not different from that.there is a back stairs influence    in my life he is none but my father.I respect him so much and admire also.He is my best friend who never hurts me.He always helps me by giving good advance.He is an ideal farmer who never and even tells a lie.His means of livelihood is the simplest.He always honors the oldest and taught us of avoiding tells a lie.so far as I remember one day he was advising me suddenly a old man entered the conversation and told a foolish speech. Next, students can improve their degree of knowledge by answering questions of other students in group. A person who tries to demonstrate some ideas should understand them perfectly to explain them. He selected people to into in a chinese room, there was a computer in chinese language with diferente symbols, the american was a diferente behavior, they did not understand what was in the computer screen. The most important step is inspect the notes which are good quality sheets and which are bad sheets.If the sheets are good,those sheets are then cut into separately and packed into cars in order to dispatach all over the city.If the sheets are bad,those sheets are then destroyed through burning. Some people who aruge that learning alone is better try to say the method is more efficient: however, it is not true at all. In order to reuse, I convert all thing reusable,for example,plastic bottle as a plant pot; glass bottle as a food container;I bring my reusable shopping bag and refuse to use a shopping plastic if a salemen offer me to bring. all my class called me creep ugly geek but still little good only when a teacher want from them a research or the exams are next couple days but Michael trying to stop me doing that because they never become my friends and i was bigger to do this things ;    that day i just finish help younger student to understand his  math lesson  My friend Michael asked me to do the same to give her answer sheet for all final exams i was in bi shook why she  want that from me  any way i collect my courage told her that was wrong and become to do that in college better to start study  now and I'll help her to study the hard lessons (i was very sad to say no & she asked me that)she become very angry and told me i should help her because we she was my best Friend then i told her that why i told her NO and she told me i hate you Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. But she is boyfriend live upstate and hasn’t got a airport he’s of city because of that she was need choose by train. Actually, studying with group is more effiecient in this situation. To sum up, studying with group is much better method than studing alone. last year I saw a movie called ''side by side'' , and talked a little of life in old history  , and coincidence I was having this matter in school, then it helped me a lot. i don't know my name .i don't know my age all i know about that i want to be a great woman ,i want the world to hear my voice , to prove that i can do it  i can do any thing  i am not weak i have woman power When I want studying for exams  going to the living room and sitting front of TV In addition, there is a small blackboard for my littel brother because my mother wants my prother learn Arabic and English letters."	1.5
100	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"think has a future that all people use public transport then I think that maybe continue to have future but has bad and good things , for example good is easier to move in the city and you save time, and the bad , bad people attack you and steal things, but I thing ,that have future ,because a lot people even they use public transport to. However, they should put a boundary to draw a line in between the smoking and non-smoking areas. To my mind our lives has been improved in these years by smarphone, satnav, digital TV, Internet.. Let's suppose a teenager of twenty-first century during the Middle ages.. don't get out alive without Wi-fii! The smokers can also enjoy their dinner at the restaurants with their friends without having to bear with the pain of not being able to light a cigarette. However, the problem of the smoke lingering in the air-condition restaurants is a cause of concern. Elizabeth apparent to be a very sweet girl, but Jason is not convince, because when he kiss her, he doesn’t feel nothing, he doesn’t feel that gravity disappear, and when his face turn red, he just put a face of horror and surprise , like if she was very sorry about kissing him. Therefore, if the restaurants want to allow smoking, they should have a partition to separate the smoking and non-smoking area. squash sport also can be played individually as two players together or in team of 4 players.squash one of the very nice attractive sports The island was flood but the island had a levee that prevent a flooding then in many year a engineers star constructing a building to had more money then in the city put many advertising in all thing : ball, balloon, movies ,etc. Michael decided to open the door and back for her, he thought better the things he do not want to leave her again, he like her, he knows himself and he wants to know her, he have kept all his feelings for a long time."	1.5
101	Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"I think in the future don't exist public transport because we will drive their car.When you drive your own transport ,a car for example, you going to from a specificlly place but in a bus you go to the bus stop and no to your house or school, work... It is better from the people be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person. Over the last few years, there have been and arguments about whether or not computers provide several advantages to human society. Today, we have more item to recycle as long as we clean properly and put in a proper bin, which will be use it by specialized factory in another item. On the other hand, others concern about new problems that can be emerged because of this technology . Indeed, I believe that computer can bring more complexity to everyone's life. One major argument is that people can communicate with one another easily due to computer. There are various websites and applications that allow people to send messages via their platforms, such as facebook, and email; therefore, people can communicate with one another although they are staying in different place. On account of this features, it provides the advantages for both of working with colleagues living in other countries and contacting foreign investors to expand business. With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of population,many agricultueal land,forest and ocesn had been used to destroyed to build more constructure and transport networks.From my own perspective,I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human  and animals. For example, in case of health problem, if individuals use computers for a long period, their eyes might be hurt. Tennis, tennis is not jsut a sport anyone can play but it's professional sport needs to more hard trainee and more time to be perfect in it, in first why I choose tennis?, seriously in 2003 this is my first time to watch the game on TV when I saw roger federer played I think he is the one that made me love this sport, due to it's professional motion in playing the ball, from this time I was interested in this game and watching all championship, so more time, time and time it was my favoirite sport. Another issue relates to ethnical problems. Nowadays, public transport is used for many people in the cities, we can find different types of them, such as bus tube and train, but is there a future for it or not?, I am going to respond this question giving disadvantanges and advantages and  finally I give my personal opinion. In this world, it allows people to express their identitiy while their real ones are unknown. Hence, it allow people to behave inappropriately without concerning about the impact to their real life. i don't know my name .i don't know my age all i know about that i want to be a great woman ,i want the world to hear my voice , to prove that i can do it  i can do any thing  i am not weak i have woman power In conclusion, although the computers can make people life easier, it comes up with new serious problem. Since the development of this technology continues, it is impoartant to find the appropriate way to manipulate new emerged problems."	1.5
102	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Last month,my friend came to Korea and visited me.In the morning We went to Ocean Park ,we saw dolphin,cat, horse and many animals .In the afternoon we went to play rollar coatser,I screamed on top of voice and called for help .Actually I hate playing rollar coster .We played mind train ,punch and a lot of games .At the end of the day I was just like running out of gas ,because I was too tired to walk any further. There would be various reasons why people travel. Reduce the fast food that make people obese and not healthy.It will be better if you gave drinks compared to the weather like whenever its winter we would like a hot drink and if it is summer we would like a chilled drink. I want to discuss about travel except for the business. One day Penny discovered it and it go to tell it to his queen, the queen at knowing that she get very confused but at the same time she get mad and she wanted revenge. So here's some reasons. First, when people goes travel they want and crave to do something special which cannot be experienced in their normal life. Think if you travel other country, or cities. If you are living in big town or small It does matter but one thing should be taking care by the people and organiser of the town, is environment.Global warming  is huge issue in today's date. Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe, in fact there is some important tournament where participate all important Europe team,They are called ""Champions League"" and ""Europa League"".football is a team sport in fact in this sport participate everyboby without exclude nobody. there was also a cup in it,It said""don't give up your dream,keep doing!go!we stand by you!come on""  Tom love it ,""thanks mom,thanks dad! Most of people will say ""No."". When people go travel they don't want to do things familiar; they want to make special event for themselves! now days, there are many type of transport in the world ,bus taxi,train but train more conform then else , I always used bus in city. If you exists at you room for 24hrs (especially at pandemic situation, whatever), you meet same bed, furniture, etc. You meet limited kinds of things and acquaintance. So I do not have opptunity to practical English Because most of my colleagues speak French.They speak French in the meeting, in the gearm, and in the shopping However, when you meet new things, people, culture, you can break a barrier of your ""thought pool"". Three robots in specific hour make a show with instruments like a band.Foxy the pirate makes a show individually in her pirate cove, The children loves Foxy because plays with the kids making questions about the pirates and count a pirate story. It can make you to be motivated and enlarge your ""thought pool"". Finally, experience and memories from travel can be the milestone or manual of your life. public transport is very crowded so you may not have a seat .I hate public transport as I was attacked by mad man once .also taxi is  not a good transport .I wish I have my own car soon to get rid of public transport . They were talking about their lives and  he remembered like he knew her on the bus, maybe  she have always been the woman of his live he looked at eyes and smile he wants to ask her whether now is not late to satart to know her but he decided leave the pub he walked to exit. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately but he forget what he had to do after thinkig he rememebred that he had to visit his grandmother as she was ill and his mother told him that his grandmother wanted to see her doctor and wanted him to take her by his car as adoctor's clinic far from her house  peter decided to go and he drove his car to his grandmother's house in the next street after he arrived, he saw his grandmother was waiting for him on the front of the street he apologized to her and asked her to come to the car, ""never mind "" she told and ride the car beside him . My name is Abrar saeed Al-mubarak.I'm 13 years old.I live in Saudi Arabia(Riyadh)  .And i'm in grade nine.I have 9 sisters with me we 10 .And 9 brothers.I really love to learn English lounge & French lounge spinach lounge  .And I speak Arabic . "", or else. You should knew about the prize for coming to the museum is very cheap ($15.00) for hour if you want to stay more time the prize increase in $10.00. Now we have a three reasons why people travel; to reduce their crave for new things, to be motivated, and to set a survival manual from their daily life. I am person that like going to do exercise, for this reason I like practise some sports, but the truth is that my favorite sport all around the world is the soccer.I believe that play soccer is an excellent activity, because in every game that the people can like always has to exist some rules. Travel could be the best treatment for th"	1.5
103	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"The picture below illustrates how to make bank notes.First is to design the note,including background color,artwork and security issues.Second is to prepare mental plates as well as qulified machinists.Then is printing with special ink.When the one side is printed,raising the images slightly to make opposite to be colored.Last is the key step,inspection.It is of importance to inspect the printed sheets.If the sheet is good or partialy damaged,it can be packed and delivered by veichals after cutted in to separate notes.Otherwise ,the sheets and notes would be abandoned and destroyed in the fire. It is natural that people from different backgrounds hold divergent attitudes towards the issue. People in favor of having a part-time job claims that a part-time job can release their financial burdens. It is common for a young man to bear a loan from the bank for some reason and support his family or himself. So a part-time job even may entertain the person as well as bring in money, if the job is just his or her interest. In this way, people will make full use of our lifetime and be energetic all the time. i dont think the public transport does not have future, there are a lot of people who can not buy a car and has to use the communite transport. The service is very bad the drivers are very angry and stressed out these do not lead with cauition, in Toluca exist report of high rates of accidents by buses. I don't think there is no future for public transport.Especially in urban, for example, Taipei city in Taiwan.People who lives there almost know the convenient public transport called MRT, it's fast, cheaper and doesn't have to find the parking lot. For my part, I would side with the first point of view. Part-time jobs do will fulfill our spare time when we have the passion to do something interesting and attracting.

104	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear Local Newspaper, Experts should not be concerned about other people that stay on the computer for a while. Maybe people know what they are doing and have to stay on computers for a long time. Firstly, staff and Personnel design the background colour , the artwork and the scuriity issues on the bank notes,which is also  done in process of other card,such as notes for supermarket.Then in the preparation process, skilled machinists prepare of metal plates for printing.After that sheets of bank notes are printed,there are differences and specials for it, it use special ink ,and print colors on both side,images are slightly rised. i think that this is the guestion for every one, and the answer can't be one for all, cause, someone can use public transport, and economy by this not only money, but and the environment, but some people don't like to use p.t., cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple don't like to travell with another people. Firstly,hyrid cars only allowed to use during weekends as result of this most people not using there cars all the week. One reason is that people can chat with one another. Summer holiday, I have been to Italy on holiday 3 years ago.I didn't have a long holiday ,it was just for 3 days but these 3 days were the best in my life.I must say that I went there because my sister is living there so I didn't have to book a room at the hotel and spending too much money.I went to the Vatican and Rome,I saw their massive buildings which were impressive and their old houses.The weather was fantastic ,I love bathing in the sun and resting on the hot sand on the beach. About @PERCENT1 of people chat online with families or friends. football is a fameous sport you can whatch it on tv or yo can see it on direct.there ara a lot of  level categories, the most fameous categorie is the first. You can tell someone what is going on and call the cops. Without a doubt chatting online is a great way to use the computer during the time your on it. Another reason is that you can search anything you need to know. Maybe if you have to search something for school, the computer can help you. This can have positive effects on people. Transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible Summer holiday, I have been to Italy on holiday 3 years ago.I didn't have a long holiday ,it was just for 3 days but these 3 days were the best in my life.I must say that I went there because my sister is living there so I didn't have to book a room at the hotel and spending too much money.I went to the Vatican and Rome,I saw their massive buildings which were impressive and their old houses.The weather was fantastic ,I love bathing in the sun and resting on the hot sand on the beach. An day in the morning Paxton waited to Long y the writer, but he listened that called him suddenly he goes for the beach and is killed for the shadow Learning about things you have never dreamed about learning. There are many people and places in the world that you still have to learn about. But I think that the future is the public transport, we need preserve nature, this is an imperative for our world, then the solution have to take the point that the governments do more invest in public transport, so the people don´t need to get a car for being able to have a job and don´t need it for normal development of their lives. Football is my favorite sports In my life.so,I pay more attention to it than any other things you might think of.I had been following series of football's events in and around the world at large.I took this time to command people who are sacrificing their entire life of the betterment of sportsmanship.With all that,I do have my favorite club team n country as well.And also have my favorite players,Ronaldinho,Messi and Eto'o.My favorite club is Barcelona and country is Cameroon although that I am from Liberia.I know football doesn't go by sentiments but the love of choice and what desire you the best.What really makes me to love Barcelona is that they play the football,instead of them running around.They always bring talented players that will make the club be more improved tactically.people always say this;""Barcelona doesn't buy players""it's not like,they are lacking money.We do essential purchasing of players to save more money.You have to save money for players to enable you to pay them on time.As normal humanbeings,you have to know how to spend money,where,when to spend it.it's not because you have more money then you lavish it.So,i love my team and my staff and how they run things in my team.The facts should not be hidden Barcelona is the best club team in the world,you like or not. I had a terrible experience in this Chinese New Year!Because Norovirus infected me!At first,I had a high fever but I thought if I take some medicine I will be fine.Therefore,my condition took a sharp turn for the worse.I cannot eat anything even in New Year's Eve and I was so tired that I cannot play poker with my cousins.Though everythings were depressing,I still have a wonderful winner vacation with my family:we went to  Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village(九族)to visited its blooming cherry blossom.

105	"If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" Wonju In Kangwondo is best familiar city for me because Wonju is my hometown. But I think that the future is the public transport, we need preserve nature, this is an imperative for our world, then the solution have to take the point that the governments do more invest in public transport, so the people don´t need to get a car for being able to have a job and don´t need it for normal development of their lives. So, Wonju is the best city for me. Her mom tried to tell Fernanda that they arrived very late because they had a very perplexed problem, so her mom told her that they came out from the park at 9:00pm it was still late but not too late, so they were on the street and the police arrived because they police thought that she had a globe with wine, and her mother told the police that she doesn't have alcohol or wine on her car, and they police didn't believed her and they took them to the police station so they could check his car, and about 10 minutes approximately they told her that she didn't have nothing so they, went from there to their house and it was late, so that’s the reason. The biggest anecdote, that I have with my friend, was our trip to Disney world.Where we could visit all the parks of Disney , like Animal Kingdom ,Hollywood studios and Magic kingdom.In adittion we could visit others parks, like Universal and Bush Garden. But, to move to other city from wonju is not easy because of traffic which is not developed well. In addition, stress is a clear disadvantage of compete because competitiors are trying to win and this can frustrates.But, some people do not think this like this and take it more simply Finally, I think that to compete in sports has some benefits and disadvantages, but when is controlated there are some benefits that help you to whole you life. First, there are tight time limits to move between Wonju and other cities. Several bus have time limit because time of first bus and final bus are fixed. Time limit for moving is very important because if users lose the possible time interval,  they have to uses bus of train in tomorrow. I used all of the things except two.I didn't have the Internet when I was child.And also we couldn't choose  programmes.I played in the street and walked to school alone.I'm thinking what kind if things were more dangerous for me?It was so dangerous when my friends and I swam in the Tobol river.We jumped into the water and caught crayfish.When I remember that moment I am exciting.I guess everychild want to investigate the world.We have to help them,to show and explain.What kind of risks they can get if to do that. If user can uses the bus only after 19:00, the user has to use the bus in tomorrow. However we the people have really important part of making it worse.Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh, clean and safe environment to their people.Recycling item can be a good step to start with clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking care by my city.Everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of province government.People is not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere. But on the other hand, in the case of bus between Daejeon and Seoul, it can be used at 0:00 as well as18:30. In conclusion the public transport is very good and if it desapear it will be a big problem, is right that some times you need a private transport but apart from that the public transport is very use by people of all ages. Next, there are many cities to which buses from Wonju cannot go. On the rest of the boring week, I was watching TV and suddenly my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet, so I decided to solve my Paris puzzles with my sister, which was less than a half solved for about one year but it had too much color in the sky so I didn't finished then a year ago. For instance, if the user living in Wonju wants to go Kongju, the user uses first bus from Wonju to Seoul and uses other bus from Seoul to Konju. It is not easy path. To my mind our lives has been improved in these years by smarphone, satnav, digital TV, Internet.. Let's suppose a teenager of twenty-first century during the Middle ages.. don't get out alive without Wi-fii! so it become a fashion of using personal vehicle which create a lot of problem big one traffic problem..... now traffic problem is the biggest problem. I love to listen to British English, but it’s really hard to study, all because we are all learning American English in Taiwan, so when I have the opportunity to contact British English, it’s full of tone cadence, always feel particularly charming, and British culture exudes noble temperament, so British accent sounds like there is always an indescribable elegance qualities. So, the number of cities to which people can go from Wonju need to be increased. In conclusion, developed traffic is required for development of Wonju. A limit of time for using the bus makes movement of users be more inconvenient. Another ones which were bad sheets and bad bank notes from damaged apparently,would be destroyed securely.This was the whole working process of the bank notes and it was consist of 7 steps. Also, a limit of place makes the movement require too many time. If user should use two buses for arriving place where they want to go, it is too waste of time. According the two reasons, traffic in Wonju have to be fixed and editied. The future for the public transport shouldn't be  taken lightly,  in my opinion, the public transport is the best option for ending the problems with the traffic jam because when we use a bus or subway , a lot of people is travelling from one place at other in only one transport or vehicle. The diabetes is the increasing  of the glucosa in the blood, The have two types, first the Diabetes Type 1 that is predent in childrens, pacient needs insuline every day, also this diabetes is caused by the destruction of the insuline realized by the person´s immuny siste."	1.5
106	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"In my opinion, public transport in my country will never improve because my country is so poor and beside it is considered one of third world countries and another think must be taken into consideration is they the politicians are horrible they have destroyed my country She turned her haid and saw him ""he was fowling me"" she thought""well,I should ask him what are he doing here"" ""What are you doing here"" ask Alison he looks her but with a bad smile,and turn his head looking at the information in more detail.Initially,bank note should be considered the design such as background colour ,artwork,and security issues.then,the preparation of metal plates is next stage.bank note should be skilled and machinists.thereafter,this stage is printing .worker should pay attention to colour on both sides,special ink , and images slightly raised. Writing can cover all aspects of life and give us ideas like racism and other inappropriate thoughts. It seems like in today's writing you can pick up just about anything and somone will find it offensive. That means if we censored our libraries to the extreme there would be no books left. It is just like Katherine Paterson says in the quote, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 can't deny that books and any other writing place ideas in our head. It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swimming and also when the age become older it will be more difficult to learn than the little . I believe we have a choice to either except or deny those offensive ideas in our head. If we find something offensive, simply set the book down and use that better judgemnt. We know what is right therefore we decide what is ok to read. Everyone sees things differently. Dear Jo, As you know, my grandmother actually lives in France with my cousint Jonh, unfortunately he has to make three months course outside of the country, Jonh will leave France next weekend, but instead it is not possible, I have to go and look after her because none of my family cant waist three months over there. In conclusion, we are assisting to a new tend in transport, every time, they are faster and more developer, with the latest technology included but at the oppossite case, we find also a contradiction, as we found an other trend for the tradictional transport which avoid the pollution in order to respect the Earth The resposibility of judgement lies more on the parents of that child than the libraries. Most of the organizations known how is affect managemant acountant practice on them work , therefore they are chossing good programme and employee. Sundully happanned sonething, I need to work to play my  studuies in the High  school, so the life changes anyway, I needed to stop my favourite sport, because I should need to study in that moment it was more important for me. Consider both aspects that can be concluded that government should respect the human right and set up a new department which use for people who want to apply to complete the military service. One night,as usual,I slept.In a flash,I rolled down from a mountain and I didn't know where I was.It just a very long tunnel where was dark and strange,After,I felt my body ache.I began to yell that hoped someone could  save me to leave from here. Those words are what fired us up to become an independent country. on the other hand, public transportation takes more time to get to the required station, because already public transport taking long path to go across more places and as more as peoples take benefits from it, and public transport usually crowed and do not be on time. Would we still be @LOCATION1 today? What it all comes down to is not that we should censore our reading but that we should use our better judgement."	1.5

That is why @CAPS1 helps people learn a different language. @CAPS1 also helps people by making @CAPS1 easier to talk to their friends you can aim, web cast, and ever text to make @CAPS1 easier @CAPS1 talk to friends on the internet.

I think that the  public  transport always going to be so important in our life  because  not all the people have the possibility to buy a car because the public transport is more expensive than a car, so for that reason the public transport in the future  could be exist, because public transport is a necesity in all the world not only for the money but too for the facility to take a bus or any other public transport The three main reasons are that you can learn a different language without paying a dime that you can talk to your friends easier and that you can send messages to your boss easier that calling him or her. Let me explain my reasons, when you drive your car you can take it from your garage or in the main door of your house and it gets you whatever you want, but on the other hand if you take public transport it will be much more uncomfortable because you must catch the bus in the bus stop... where is your nearest bus stop?"	1.5

"the public transport  have no future , the crisis in 2008 ; has been down the oil prices .The oil is cheap now and new cars are more efficient and the goverment give stimolous for consumers. Firstly,hyrid cars only allowed to use during weekends as result of this most people not using there cars all the week. Advances in technology are helping us become more efficiant. Computers also give us the ability to research places and things we @MONTH1 never get the opportunity to see in person. Everyone eagerly waiting for the ambulance arrival but still not yet reached the reason is our college location is little far from the city that's why it is getting late. The most important, though, is our advances in technology. My town do much efforts to care of environment,they put many pins in the streets to keep it clean also they prevent private drivinig at many days to keep air clean ,they seed trees to absorb co2 and release o2 ,they build factories away from the house of population to prevent respiratory diseases which is a result of air pollution from factories,so not only my country it self but also the individuals follow a proper way to keep environment clean. To my mind our lives has been improved in these years by smarphone, satnav, digital TV, Internet.. Let's suppose a teenager of twenty-first century during the Middle ages.. don't get out alive without Wi-fii! I had truancy and did not pay attention to studies.That really the biggest harm to a hard-working woman whom my mother tried all her best to feed me up and help me complete my studies.All the members of my family never give me up,and I finished my college studies ,too .I have a good job now.I do really thank my mother and all the members for paying the patient and exertion to me .Now we have  great relationship with each other and treasure the happiness  we get not so easy.So,are the members of my family my best friends？I'll answer you ：there's not much better answer than Yes！ hello  my name is Mustafa I am 23 years old and I am Student in collage I search for job but I don't find a job I wish that my country become a great country and better and I wish to married who I love her  thank you Computers made these things much easier for people to accomplish. Computers are also useful for lending us the ability to research far away places or other topics that they @MONTH1 just have. In case of transportation technology, in this twenty first century we have various option like Plan that can fly with the cloud, train that fast and big enough that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time. I am person that like going to do exercise, for this reason I like practise some sports, but the truth is that my favorite sport all around the world is the soccer.I believe that play soccer is an excellent activity, because in every game that the people can like always has to exist some rules. And then they go on there computer and see that there is a ragby @LOCATION1. George's restaurant is a very pleasant place with many tasteful recipes from all around the world to enjoy alone or with your company your dinner.The Head-chef is an experienced and skillful man in his work.The food ,his team of chefs,prepare is always magnificent and the decoration a piece of art ,not to mention that the decoration is fully engaged in the Head-chef .Not only the food but also the restaurant itself is a very beautiful destination . When you go to a new country, you also get the opportunity to meet new people. Ferrari making one of the fastes cars on the word, but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac, how they were in the past.If sameone like cars then should go to Formula 1 race to hear the bolid engine sound, I think that is the best voice which I have ever heard in my life.Formula 1 it is also  dangerous sport, the driver are exposed to the risk of  accident at high speed. When freddy begin to sings the kids screams and they sing with Freddy the famous Freddy Fazbear´s Song,Bonny plays the battery and Chica serves the pizza to the children, This year the stablishment close because they found the body of a dead child. Hey my name is Joe and i´m 21 years old and i´l think i´l would compliment the summer camp very good, because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak. Either way, the computer is a convinient place to go and talk to someone. I believe that computers are doing us more good than their harm. Firstly, Django Unchained remembered us the hard life suffered by black people in the past, due to a great introduction without dialogues, where black people were unchained while they came back to be selling to an owner farm, it being matching with an amanzing soundtrack as identity Tarantino´s films. They also give us the ability to search topics we want to know more about or a faraway place we've never been to. It was a cold day at night when I was at home watching my favourite programme on my telly called ""dare to win"", I was with my brother, when we decided to call, The programme is about questions for the contestants that must be answer in correct time, and there is a different things for the winner. My studies in tecnologico de Monterrey are demanding and challenging because it has a very high educative score all worldwide, but also has to many good things, for example we have a lot of interchanges all around the world, when you have the opportunity to do an interchange you have to deal with the language and the culture with the other country, that means you have to be responsible for studying the basics things of that country, but all of this is worthwhile because when you are there you have so much fun."	1.5
109	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"If you want we could go to the capital city of my country, we will go by the car because the car is cheaper than the bus or train, we could eat in the famous restaurant of the city or we could go to the cinema also if you want I could visit the medieval wall. On one hand you put all your things in the car and drive anywhere you want to, on the other hand if you feel not very well to drive, you have no money to buy a car or the downtown of your city is closed for all the means of transport except for the public ones: tram, bus or trolley bus is your wayout. Reduce the fast food that make people obese and not healthy.It will be better if you gave drinks compared to the weather like whenever its winter we would like a hot drink and if it is summer we would like a chilled drink. Obesity and other thins about help, is a topic very important because the people is dying for this problem.For example, the form to prepare the food, is gonna be dangerous because a lot food have artificial thing that is no good for us. this situation to create many pollution for environment so we have more conscience for the planet health Most of the restaurants are air conditioned; they don't allow smokers inside their restaurants but still they damage the freshness of the air outside. Because you are the best teacher in the whole world!many of our class classmate really like you too!We know that you are going to teach  Discovery-bay  primary school .My English result is  better once  you taught me I really love you, Ms Cumings!your friend Ms Decock told me that  she is going to Australia ,and I love you two both I hope you that you will come back some times ! Smoking is already a part of a smoker's life. I like to play football cause for me, as well as one hobby, is one way to stand out of the world, of the problem that every day I have to face, and at the end it makes me calm and happy. Some say that it can make them feel better and can calm their body. They don't even think what smoking can do not only with their health but also with their life. I think it would be important that, not only in the family, but also in the school could be grow a new generaion sensible to ecological problems of the earth. when i ran with the ball, i feel that i hold a goal or a valuable something and i should offer my best to put it in his place and make it in right way  . It can cause you to have a lung cancer. It affects not only your lungs but also the other internal organs of your body. Nowadays, the transportation become more prefect,and the people'life become more convenient.Althought this change lend the life of people efficient,the problem should not be ignored.It would really be helpful if the government make tighter resrictions,in today's world ,lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission, they are destroyed the forest,farmland and wetland,charging waster water and emitting greenhouse gas,it lead to a serious enviorment problem.So the government should oversee this companies ,and if companies do not obey the rules or laws ,it will be fined and closed. Smoking can risk your life. Frist of all at home we recycle plastics, glasses, papers and cartons, oils, clothes, batteries, organics in an especial composting bank where we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials and finally all the other things are sends to an especial tip where we avoid to drop it anywhere. As a very good advice, stop smoking early before it's too late. television entertains as well as it will educate the people.These days are educating themselves by watching the television.Televison not only provide entertainment it will give lots of information about the happenings around the globe.Channels like national geographic and animal planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origination of species.Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people"	1.5

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. I have to start saying that I never imagine swimming like my favorite sport, because until my back´s injury, I practiced other sports, I most like extreme sports like downhill, skateboarding martial arts like Aikido, jiujitsu or ninjutsu, but for my injury I have to start swimming and now I love it. But why public transport have no future to stand and keep going?, that's because of the people that changing their mind, they start like having their own way to travel, Privacy also an important reason, people need to have a private means of transportation. Also, for adults, they can take care of some finances and bills online and some taxes. I think computers definitely have a positive effect on people. A lot of people use their computers to learn new stuff about other things and people. Nine out of ten people go on the computer at least more than once a month to learn about something new. after that the celebration was began and a lot of their friends have attended each one presented a gift for Sara , she was very delighted and suddenly the doorbell been rang  she was her old friend Tia . Kids in school use computers in school all the time for projects and experiments and they learn new stuff about people and things in the world. And to day is necessary because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversation with their you need to now more than your foreign language, because in the rest of the world and particularly in Europe people now more than two language and that great. we bocome not only older but also wiser .we learn but the most useful thing to learn is to get in alot of experiences & for sure to make mistakes .but we have to be honest with our selves by admitting our mistakes to avoid them in the future . i know that i am not professional player and i am n't belong to any team  but i like this game .basketball is so simple play but it is need Speed ,concentration and The ability to determine the distances  , it  contains of two team of five player and each team try to get a high point by throwing the ball through the basket. This is a good thing because they’re able to talk to friends and family from a long distance and enjoy themselves. People complaint about how the information about different TV shows don't contribute in the process of learning, that's why many of This programmes are considered trash, because of the multiples shows such as realities, talk shows,or showbiz that hardly ever have a good message or something interesting for people. Another positive effect computers have for you is that adults can pay bills and finances on the computer also. Seven out of ten adults pay bills online at their computer. This is a good thing because adults have to do it by hand, now they can just do it on the computer, which is definitely a positive effect on a person! as a result of this consumer gets more benefit like lower faire, privacy, freedom and safe travelling.in addition many automobile company launcing new car with affordable price which insiost people to use more and more private vechile. They help people learn new stuff about things and. First, Basketball is team sport when it means i need to understand expression of  members  of team and keep contact them  for example  my roll is cutter but i need to do assister, blocker and guarding when i play. And finally, they allow you to do finances and pay the bills online instead of by hand. One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance,  homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society. I hope you take my side about my opinion about computers and that they definitely have a positive affect on people."	1.5

"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, Computers can be a great asset to our society, but they are an even, bigger hindrance. People are wasting their days away on the computer. Hardly anyone goes out in exercise, or to enjoy nature. Perhaps the sea west effect is that hardly anyone interacts with their friends and family anymore. @CAPS2 you with their friends and family anymore. Yesterday ,I had a wonderful day  .In the morning I went to a Galician basketball training with a coach of Spanish selection ,when  finished went to my parents to a hotel to eat and stay with some friends , after the food meet with  friend´s of my parents and went to a theme park and we rode to a rollers coaster, it was very exciting and we ate a chocolate ice cream, it was delicious .At night we went to a match  of Spanish basketball league, Obradoiro versus Real Madrid and that match won the team of Real Madrid and then I went home to sleep. Nowadays, the transportation become more prefect,and the people'life become more convenient.Althought this change lend the life of people efficient,the problem should not be ignored.It would really be helpful if the government make tighter resrictions,in today's world ,lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission, they are destroyed the forest,farmland and wetland,charging waster water and emitting greenhouse gas,it lead to a serious enviorment problem.So the government should oversee this companies ,and if companies do not obey the rules or laws ,it will be fined and closed. Obesity in @LOCATION1 is at an all time high. Volleyball its my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I were in another world, in which I can be free and happy, apart of this, when I am bad, this is a distration of the university. People who spend a lot of time on the computer hardly ever exercise and that effects them negatively. If difficulties was told to the families, the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation. They might not be around in twenty years to see their grand children grown up. Also, they have many medical problems. Some people guess the nuclear power has a great value to produce power instead of the fossil fuels such as : coals and oil which are Not renewable energy.Moreover, they think that controlling the pollution is possible. @CAPS1 can kill you! for example, lunch time travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emission of carbon mono oxide which is effected to red blood cells and irritate to breathing system. @CAPS2 you can avoid these diseases and health risks by getting off the computer, why wouldn't you? the citizens in the town must participate in this , the citizen will take the responsibility for specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish into correct place and clean tree and plant more of it . Do you have fond childhood memories that involve nature? In old times luxuries were not considered as compare to Heslth but now every one prefer to save time and maintain privacy which one can only afford by using her/his private transport so gradually public transport losing its charm. Most people who spend too much time on the computer don't get the chance to make memories like that. First of all, thank you professor to teach in the meantime, the entire course of the learn really benefited, especially in the first meeting, for British English, I still did not really understand, it makes me frustrated, but gradually after I found the beautiful of the language in British English, I think it’s all because of the usual problem of American English, and so I really appreciate that you choose simple  textbooks and it’s easy to learn, and you really very carefully and very humorous, you're always careful in curriculum pronunciation correction for each student, using a variety of reading skills let us immerse them read. On the top of the steps is the inspectation by hands, that is to say, they should be separated into well-qualified ones,which are to be cut into bank notes,and delivered to the banks and the bad ones which can't be utilited are fired definitely at the last stage. one day Micheal wanted to go out from his home so he called his besfriend an suggested to go out togther , his friend agreed , so Michael weared his closes , wnet out and closed the door but at this moment he knew he had made a mistake . ""In the past few years. the movie I´m going to be reviewing is ""the purge""  I actually loved it quite a lot, I just loved all the suspense and the parts they leave you hanging, it´s just way too interesting, the movie is about the american government who annually gives 12 hours where all crime, even murder, is legal, and there are no medical services during that long period of what they call ""the purge"" and anyone can join it, you can kill whoever you want. This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Get off you computers and go outside! I share everything with my friends and family and try to spend as much time with them as possible. First of all,friends are important for us,we want a friend that we can share our secrets and problems.But friends maybe in the future go away or hurt you!So you can't always based on them!For example,they need you until they find someone better than you and in the end they go away.But family never let you go or family never go away from you! I don’t like Narnia, but my favorite movie is probably 22 jump street, Lord of the rings, The tv-show: suits, The walking dead and maybe south park and family guy. They die when John was too little to remember and he never know what happened so he went to all the parts for saw them even he walked and walked even at reverse but he never found them. Then if you want we could go to the restaurant of the city later if you want we could fiand a job for three months, in my opinion a good job for three months I could be the waiter because the waiter get much money in the three months of the summer. We hardly ever see kids with friends and family hanging around"". Secondly,Closed trash bins provided to the people in order to collect the waste and recycling.People come forward and utilising this bin effectively instead of throwing away.As a result of this town looks clean compare to previous decades. Now is the time to stop using computers! One thousand people by eighteen and more are questions in my town about their way takes care of the environment.Investigation reveals the youngsters are more than ever power to  save the world from waste and pollution. Maybe it's the people a though computers do contribute to the problem. although traveling by car is really interesting but still using public transport has its advantages ,by using public transport you're saving  effort when  driving a car for along distance you will get tired , some people don't have enough money to buy their own car . Memories would be when we hung around with friends and family. The social networks such as: Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,Google plus... are connecting  us to more and more friends, companies, public figures, books, films, social organizations...we are really have many things to see, to think, to ""like"", to ""comment"" and a dozen of stuffs that we can make an action to interactive with others...so may it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves, to take care our healthy. Call up a friend and take a stroll, @CAPS3 you do, know you can have fun withour computers."	1.5
112	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Smoking should be banned in all restaurants because cigarette is dangerous to our health. ?XD)Cherry blossom is very beautiful but there are so many people.When we went to Sun Moon Lake by cable car,wind is so strong!I felt a little nervous though the scenery amazing.All in all,I stil have a memorable vacation. I think it would be important that, not only in the family, but also in the school could be grow a new generaion sensible to ecological problems of the earth. Smoking worsens asthma, having an asthma I avoid those people who use to smoke. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants because restaurant is for those people who want to eat not to those people who just smoke. ""As you well know, rose's life is your hands"" she said and keep talking:""...You are the only one, that can save her life, but before you must comply with your promise"". we all know that do sport is very important to keep our life healthy and happy.My favourite sport actually is walking;and I prefer walking in the morning and before sundown.I like also walking in public street,gardens,clubs and on the shore.when i want to go anywhere;I do my best to go on foot.I like this sport since my childhood because I found that I can think about my good time when I was child and relax with myself to think carefully about my present and future.The walking can also fitness and do the knee stronger.It would be interesting to accompain your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time.I advice my guys who suffer from laziness and overweight,try to walk one hour at least and after that they will like this sport. I have to say that study another language give you more opportunities  because on these days you need to now other language to look for a work and be more inteligent than your college to take the work and that’s great. Second-hand smoke is dangerous when a person is constantly exposed to it, but just one exposure can be dangerous to people with pre-existing conditions. Addiction to cigarettes is both mental and physical. But, in this moment the people think different, is to start to help the world and  Contamination is big problem for us and the planet. Banning smoking in restaurants prevents customers who enjoy smoking while they eat or drink alcohol. For smokers who go to restaurants often, this is an inconvenience which has positive effects on their health whether they like it or not."	1.5
113	"If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"It is a great worry for most of employers to choose proper workers they will work together with. Some employers choose to hire inexperienced workers at a lower salary and help them develop as a better worker in the process of co-working. However, I would prefer to hire an experienced workers regardless of their higher salaries if I were an employer. Other reason for my opinión is that almost all the people preffer use the visual sense and ear to other person more than write and listen for understand new things. Here, efficiency can both include short term views and long term views. However,the family is near you since the day you were born until forever.The members follow you,and can based on them.You can tell whatever you want to them.For example,if you are in a bad mood the first person that will come next to you,to make you smile is your mom or dad.Mom and dad spent their life to grow up their children,to feed them,to love them! Sometimes the employers do strike and we clients do not known in time as a result we can not get on time to work,that is one of the disadvantages of using public transport. I do currently master but I can devote myself to the Fellowship Especially since I finished the Pre-Masters and now I need only follow-up from time to time with my guide Academic, so I have the time for the Fellowship . Next in the long term perspective, it is more efficient and helpful to work with workers who knows well about the working field than beginners. There is an example that I experienced in my high school ages. I was a head of one design club in my school and worried about what criteria  I should consider when choosing new club members. I discussed together with club members  and concluded to choose new members regardless of their abilities but to consider their passion about our club. In these diagrams below,the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly.The first step,the bank notes should be desinged concidering some constructions,like background color,artwork and security issues,After it was prepared,skilled machinists would make preparaation of metal plates in the second step.Then,sheets of bank notes would be printed by 50 bank notes per sheet,which have colour imagines on both sides in special ink.After printing well,these sheets would be manually inspected closely.It was the most important step during the whole processing.And then,some  sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets  which would be cut into and separated into equal ones andpacked and depatched to where they are demanded. We were not able to produce sufficient new designs thus were hard to sell our products to gather 
money for donation. It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. when he come she start crying and thought he would break up with her and she did not give him a chance to talk or explain anything she started to cry louder and accused him of cheating that make michael astonished how she did not trust in him ,how she thought that about him and he told her that he can not stand that anymore he would break up with her and he left .Michael close the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake But I think that is kind of random problem because their argument also implies that inexperienced workers can be really bad at working. From the beginning of the world till now , human wants the fast income and the easy ways of live , so he tries more and more to find a solution for  his problems by creating a new ways of liveing more easy and more convenient  for him. In other words, they are ensured professionals. Lastly, to rebut to the idea that the inexperienced workers will be more passionate, I think worker's passion doesn't differ according to if they experienced the workplace or not. There are many professional workers who are still passionate and curious about their work field. The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots. Although a high salary might work as an obstacle in hiring experienced workers, the experienced workers will do well in the workplace."	1.5

On the top of the steps is the inspectation by hands, that is to say, they should be separated into well-qualified ones,which are to be cut into bank notes,and delivered to the banks and the bad ones which can't be utilited are fired definitely at the last stage. Also many more jobs want people with computer skills. MOTASSEM is a tall guy about 175 c.m and his Weight is 71 k.g and  has a wight skin  .He love going to the beach and he love swimming .He is a casual clothes wearing such Shirt and jeans which mostly  blue,Gray and Black .If you see him you notice how he is an elegant . Can you imagine how much harder it would be to communicate with someone who lives in, lets say @LOCATION1. I'll tell you a story happened  at school   as any normal pouring day  when you  teenager in school never ever end, but a one day was the best day from any  other pouring normal day because i learn how  live as powerful smart girl who used to let the other us her because she want to feel needed from my friends but i did not have many friends in school except  ""Michael"". I used all of the things except two.I didn't have the Internet when I was child.And also we couldn't choose  programmes.I played in the street and walked to school alone.I'm thinking what kind if things were more dangerous for me?It was so dangerous when my friends and I swam in the Tobol river.We jumped into the water and caught crayfish.When I remember that moment I am exciting.I guess everychild want to investigate the world.We have to help them,to show and explain.What kind of risks they can get if to do that. In later time, society feel the need for change about iniquities that pass in the country and the Mexican Revolution explotes, the building is abandoned because the government and country dont have money for construction, to the point the building  metal estructure was used as weapons. That would be a lot harder if you had to write letters. It would also cost a lot more money to call. First of all,tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world.Alongside with its development,the ablity of travalling has easened to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another.The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism,as well as with the idea of globalisation,since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen. It all started in the Parson Institute in the class of art history students of the race of Fine Arts in the class the teacher in charge, Jimena, commissioned a task to his students, saying: -To Begin with this course, I want to be sure they know the meaning of art, pro I want it translated into a sculpture or painting made by yourselves, without any specific technique, only your imagination, with it you explain to me what it is art. This is terrible, you do not have privacy authought the society have a blame, because if they do not take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored. Also 'internet' in our days helps to get information all over the world, and if you wish to get involved then go to the www.bbc.co.uk.These sites are free way to find most adequate information about actual events both in society and technical life. Another good reason is that many more jobs these days want to hire someone who knows how to work with computers. You can do a lot more things on a computer that you cant do on a piece of paper. I am from spain so my foreign language is Spanish I start to study another language when I was a child, I started learning English because every one said that English is the future language, when I finished my school time I tried to study French but it was so difficult for me. These things have evolved over the years thanks to computers. Finally my last reason, its not only educational its also fun. Sure you can research information and do you rhomework on the computer, but you can also play games. people that they play in this categorie are fameous althoug you can see them on tv.if you want to be a big football player you must to practise more time and yoor life should to be healthy. Computers can be programed to have simulations for jobs like policemen ambulance drivers, and doctors. These are all things that save lives. That is why i think computers have a positive effect on people. Fifty minutes passed ,when my body no longer was sore.I decided to walk to the end.Constantly,I just walked like without terminal contest.While I strugged to walk.Finally,I saw a light to appeare my eyes and I woke up."	1.5

"Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately but he forget what he had to do after thinkig he rememebred that he had to visit his grandmother as she was ill and his mother told him that his grandmother wanted to see her doctor and wanted him to take her by his car as adoctor's clinic far from her house  peter decided to go and he drove his car to his grandmother's house in the next street after he arrived, he saw his grandmother was waiting for him on the front of the street he apologized to her and asked her to come to the car, ""never mind "" she told and ride the car beside him . Also, they have enable us to create a @CAPS2 age in research. However, compared to the line of indoor swimming pool,the difference of seasonal achievement of ice cream van is considerably large.Overall,the achievement of ice cream van is better than the indoor swimming pool,from about 1100 to 5500. the actions of this film took place in Alexandrie city of Egypt and it talks about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they didn't have much money to produce their own albums , that sort of bands is   famous between the youth and they call it ""under ground bands "" .their songs give a big concenet to the political and social stituation in Egypt and they become famous after the25 january revoulation , why I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society , there is no chance for the youth and if they found it , they face lot of problems to save it and they didn't find time for other activties and in sometimes they worked in thing which  they never learn or love First, one fantastic program such as @CAPS5 (instant messaging) has given us the amazing ability to hold a conversation with one or more people any where in the world, and be able to respond within an instant. In a recent survey @PERCENT1 of people said that they prefer instant messaging over any other type of communication beside face to face talking, second, most computers come with webcams built in now, so you can actually see the person you are communicating with. I had friend move recently, and we are able to see what each other are doing and remain friends even though we don't live in the same town, and I'm sure a similar experience has occured to you or someone you know. as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! People can now see things go on in your info whereever want. Although some it has a wonderful computers have established incredible ways of communication. A second reason computers positively import people is that they have created a numerous research. One example would be our phenomenon search engine, google. In the present world television is very important.But sometimes it can also affect us in a negetive way..most people around the world can see any news in live.media is more help full for the people .television is also using as a study  material for example smart classes, online courses etc. But today, Things are getting change and technology marked a significant role in our life, Automobile segment increased its vertical and having a car becomes a need from luxory. I used all of the things except two.I didn't have the Internet when I was child.And also we couldn't choose  programmes.I played in the street and walked to school alone.I'm thinking what kind if things were more dangerous for me?It was so dangerous when my friends and I swam in the Tobol river.We jumped into the water and caught crayfish.When I remember that moment I am exciting.I guess everychild want to investigate the world.We have to help them,to show and explain.What kind of risks they can get if to do that. Finally, computers have established amazing @CAPS2 entertainment for people of all ages. at last I wanna talk about my cousins , I love the most of them especially the cousin in the same age , they are my friends , i love too much ,and also the rest of my family Espesialy there are a lot of greens these makes good health.However someone have to take care of them.The town have to do that and I think in England there are so many greens all around,so a lot of people take care of these that makes good environment.After I have been to live in England with my family I have goton the feel very much indeed. However we the people have really important part of making it worse.Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh, clean and safe environment to their people.Recycling item can be a good step to start with clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking care by my city.Everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of province government.People is not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere. computers are an incredible way to achieve quick, un expensive entertaiment in todays economy. When freddy begin to sings the kids screams and they sing with Freddy the famous Freddy Fazbear´s Song,Bonny plays the battery and Chica serves the pizza to the children, This year the stablishment close because they found the body of a dead child. they're established now forms of communication, research and entertainment that will forever change society. Ferrari making one of the fastes cars on the word, but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac, how they were in the past.If sameone like cars then should go to Formula 1 race to hear the bolid engine sound, I think that is the best voice which I have ever heard in my life.Formula 1 it is also  dangerous sport, the driver are exposed to the risk of  accident at high speed."	1.5

"People should ues computers, they do benefit to society. This is due to Lima in the beginning  has not had a pant to desing its public road s and highways, and it only has been improvising to build their way without any criteria to transport its population. Think about it, paper is made out of trees and of coarse to get the paper you must cut down the tree first, and then have it an through a whole wasteful process to get that paper.If everyone used computers we wouldn't have to cut down those beautifully, lush trees. i think that this is the guestion for every one, and the answer can't be one for all, cause, someone can use public transport, and economy by this not only money, but and the environment, but some people don't like to use p.t., cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple don't like to travell with another people. Today, we have more item to recycle as long as we clean properly and put in a proper bin, which will be use it by specialized factory in another item. Someone was calling the door while that someone was stealing in your house... By that, her sister is scared and woke up...  Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake They'll never get old! Also in the sort way, we should go walking to the destination.icle If we are working with  sameone in the same jobs, and  who lives near or he is our neighbour, we can go to the work in the same car, this way we use less oil. A lot of people @DATE1 are very sensitive about our enviroment and how we're treating the earth. They are looking for new ways to help the world be as green as possible. An easy alternitive for paper is a computer. Her sons have a problem they cant see the natural light and one they Grace got up because her children were shouting and crying so she went to their bedroom and the courtins was not there so she go to the other room and the courtins also were not there so she stars getting nervous and more nervous so she go and talk to the servants, so she got very angry and she told them go out of my house and they did not care so she pick up a gun and the old lady returned her keys. Nevertheless the journalists stay all the time having a photo,all the time,when they eaten, drinking, happy, sad,how is your love life and with whoever stay, if stay with something important our what buy. Ok so i know, computers use up a lot of energy, but to be honest they don't have to. In conclusion the public transport is very good and if it desapear it will be a big problem, is right that some times you need a private transport but apart from that the public transport is very use by people of all ages. The use of computers is extremely eco friendly and like i said before is a great alternitive to our everyday wasteful use of paper and pencil. Do you want to look up information fast? Well on the computer you can! All you do is type in what you need in a search engine and @CAPS1! Yesterday ,I had a wonderful day  .In the morning I went to a Galician basketball training with a coach of Spanish selection ,when  finished went to my parents to a hotel to eat and stay with some friends , after the food meet with  friend´s of my parents and went to a theme park and we rode to a rollers coaster, it was very exciting and we ate a chocolate ice cream, it was delicious .At night we went to a match  of Spanish basketball league, Obradoiro versus Real Madrid and that match won the team of Real Madrid and then I went home to sleep. Instead of using a book (which wastes trees) to slowly find your information you can use a simple computer to do the job. After two years that his essay was released, he will understand that his essay was wrong moreover, Michael will want to apologise many people who read his essay thereby Michael now goes home, takes a cup of tea, goes to bed thus Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake Do you want that or slow information found in a boring book? After we came to the ambulance,police come and one patrol was catching those man who made that to that granny and the other patrol was talking to us.I found out that granny name is Rose and she had got operation after the accident. Today, we have more item to recycle as long as we clean properly and put in a proper bin, which will be use it by specialized factory in another item. Ok so the computer does show to cause distractions and headaches if used too long, but it is a great invention of the future. Instead of going to a restaurant and ordering off we'll order of computers/touch screans. Personally I believe that those who are not participate any activity the teachers has them to encourage .Then only they also know how talented they are.Every student should attend and show their talent.After some ages we can not attend any this type of activity because we all are become old .So let do and enjoy your young age be happier. More environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of themthere is to that we have a center of care and, other more institutions, we also make environmental protection centers were people can visit and learn about this to sum up our village is very concentrated on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us Them they drink a cafe that give them many energy to construct faster the building, this café has a combination for the people can to live all the night. I don’t like Narnia, but my favorite movie is probably 22 jump street, Lord of the rings, The tv-show: suits, The walking dead and maybe south park and family guy. I have to say that study another language give you more opportunities  because on these days you need to now other language to look for a work and be more inteligent than your college to take the work and that’s great. I am also committed to preparing monthly reports for newspaper supplement “The Voice of Women” which issued by the WATC “Women's Affairs Technical Committee , and I have the cooperation with the Environment and Development the magazine which issued by Center for development work ""Maan"", annd other web sites and news and media organizations."	1.5

I just finish my lunch time, and before prepare everything to go to work I was thinking of you and I wanted to give you a small surprise with this fantastic photos, I hope you like it. This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. they can be entertained by online games, communicate with friends and family and receive news about what is happening around the world. Although some people do not always benefit by having a computer, most @ORGANIZATION1 the time people are satisfied, and do benefit from the use @ORGANIZATION1 computers. Here are some tips about the Egyptian people  they are so kind ,friendly,stressed but have a lot of  problems now days the level of poverty, standard of level ,the fixed cost  is increasing dramatically and the purchasing power is decreasing. Although I just mentioned two non-educational examples, there are many educatiional websites on the internet which children can learn from. The son of Lucy and her husband one day he went to caved holes in the dirt for make a game, he make five holes and in the last one he found a brilliant jewelry that had been generations of gods so he started throwing that for play, one time that he take the jewelry, it consume the mind of the little guy and that cause that the jewelry liberated some sounds that only giants can hear so a mountain stand up that was the face of a giant and he perceive negative waves so he kill the guy because he had the most important relic of the gods. My town do much efforts to care of environment,they put many pins in the streets to keep it clean also they prevent private drivinig at many days to keep air clean ,they seed trees to absorb co2 and release o2 ,they build factories away from the house of population to prevent respiratory diseases which is a result of air pollution from factories,so not only my country it self but also the individuals follow a proper way to keep environment clean. in modern day there is very little public transpotr are used,ganeral public prefer much faster and conveninece  ways of traveling  around.though the pulic transport are used in mager citys to avoied traffic conjustion,it is wlidly reconizge that public transport are eco friendly. Parker goes on leaving websites. He will play on these websites for hours. Although he is sloveling infront @ORGANIZATION1 a computer screen he is learning. While I were in ANDRAPRADESH every year we have Christmas function in December although we are not interested to attend Drama they were not leave us without participation even simple character.They gave me a character like THE GOD .Firstly I never aware about how act and do this particular character.And from October to till December we practise everyday after our study hour up to eleven ""O""CLOCK.DAY BY DAY  I learn and finally I did my role well.Then I think myself why I wasted all my school days . They say this because a computer screen catches peoples attention. Learning is a major priority and if it means putting a child infront @ORGANIZATION1 a computer for an hour will improve this, then that is what will happen. @CAPS1 next reason why effect @ORGANIZATION1 computers on people is positive, is because it helps people communicated with friends or family. as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! our family will video chat with him over a program called @ORGANIZATION4. the actions of this film took place in Alexandrie city of Egypt and it talks about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they didn't have much money to produce their own albums , that sort of bands is   famous between the youth and they call it ""under ground bands "" .their songs give a big concenet to the political and social stituation in Egypt and they become famous after the25 january revoulation , why I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society , there is no chance for the youth and if they found it , they face lot of problems to save it and they didn't find time for other activties and in sometimes they worked in thing which  they never learn or love If you want we could go to the capital city of my country, we will go by the car because the car is cheaper than the bus or train, we could eat in the famous restaurant of the city or we could go to the cinema also if you want I could visit the medieval wall. More environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of themthere is to that we have a center of care and, other more institutions, we also make environmental protection centers were people can visit and learn about this to sum up our village is very concentrated on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us Thirty-two percent said over the phone and about sixteen percent said in person. sukh was so angry with him because he heart her a lot, sukh refuse to give her laptop and her brother start again fighting with her and even he slapped her sister. I would say that the computer is a good effect ion people when used this way. As i didn’t found nothing, i went to the place he live at and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he care about so as i continued to go to his houes i notice he will alays go to tehe same house so i decidec to follow him to the house and i foun out he was dating a girl she might be his girlfrien so i finally gota an idea, i would drive him crazy just as he did with me, that way she will think he had problems on his mind and left him, but son i thougt about it again and realized that if i did that she will try to help him and they will be more united,  so i decided to drive them both crazy almost at the border of death,  jus as he did with me! When i was arrived at home, i was started to read the news paper, so i found from there The International Student Magazine have to organize a short story competition, and I decide to call Michael to tell him about this contest. Alsom a few months ago a class at @ORGANIZATION3 made a pie-chart and discovered how their classmates find out world news. Fifty-six percent said they foud out their news from computers. However,the family is near you since the day you were born until forever.The members follow you,and can based on them.You can tell whatever you want to them.For example,if you are in a bad mood the first person that will come next to you,to make you smile is your mom or dad.Mom and dad spent their life to grow up their children,to feed them,to love them! Just the other night at dinner our waiter was from @LOCATION4 and he said he received all @ORGANIZATION1 his news about his hometown from the internet. As you can see many people use the internet on their computers to receive news and information. It is easy to tell that the effect computers have on people is positive because @ORGANIZATION1 the reasons I have stated above; people can be entertained, they can communicate with family and friends, and @MONTH1 recieve news about what's happening around the world. Like I said on the first paragraph, not all the effects are positive but most @ORGANIZATION1 them are!"	1.5

"Dear local news paper I believe the computer has a positive effect on people. It helps students with projects, helps people learn about other places, @CAPS1 it helps you find information on something you didn't know. The social networks such as: Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,Google plus... are connecting  us to more and more friends, companies, public figures, books, films, social organizations...we are really have many things to see, to think, to ""like"", to ""comment"" and a dozen of stuffs that we can make an action to interactive with others...so may it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves, to take care our healthy.

Is there a place out there that you really want to know more about, that you hope to someday visit? Well you can always use the computer to find out more about the place. That I want to say, is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb's in Spanish Languaje, just Imaging you the same but not in your native lenguaje. Nowadays we use technology in every thing, from educations to making clothes, we use technology everyday and everywhere.Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful,useful and  important for development but todays generation is influenced whit technology that they have stopped to do other activities. The computer will keep you updated on what is happening there everyday. Already public transport have been improvement and that makes comfortable to go on a trip,but I think that will be able to become good quality more and more,because so many people expectation. cell phone I chose this invention that I think that helped to humanity to communicate more easily,  Motorola It was the first doing something to a mobile phone  was on 3 April 1973 the first to do so was an employee of Martin Cooper Cooper made mobile phone history in April 1973 when he made the first ever call on a handheld mobile phone After that, with the new technology they could invent new and better dispositives for the needs of users  ""taken from https://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/guides/history-of-mobile-phones/"" On one hand you put all your things in the car and drive anywhere you want to, on the other hand if you feel not very well to drive, you have no money to buy a car or the downtown of your city is closed for all the means of transport except for the public ones: tram, bus or trolley bus is your wayout. In conclusion computers aren't just a thing that kids play on all day it helps you with many things like getting your work done, finding out about places, and finding out information about things you need to know, ""And @CAPS3!"""	1.5

"At first, I had called a travel agent but he said he couldn’t be able to book me a flight before two months, so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent. While living in campus, I felt walking through campus costs time a lot, so  I bought a bicycle to move faster. Not only me, but nearly half of students use bicycle. However, I experienced many unconvinient moments when riding bicycle in campus. This sport cause fresh and jolly me and I think will exercise cause healthy.if you start volleyball, you need a ball and piece of ground that separate with tie. I think it would be important that, not only in the family, but also in the school could be grow a new generaion sensible to ecological problems of the earth. First, bicycle road is not well connected. subsequently,this step is most important.bank note should be inspected.bank notes separated into good and bad if get good quality sheets,the next stage is packaging and distribution.at this stage sheets should be cut into separate bank notes,packed,and dispatched. However, except the big, main roads, the road is disconnected. For example, in endless road, since there are no bicycle road, I had to use the car road. My advice of finding work, is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work.But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase. Football is my favorite sports In my life.so,I pay more attention to it than any other things you might think of.I had been following series of football's events in and around the world at large.I took this time to command people who are sacrificing their entire life of the betterment of sportsmanship.With all that,I do have my favorite club team n country as well.And also have my favorite players,Ronaldinho,Messi and Eto'o.My favorite club is Barcelona and country is Cameroon although that I am from Liberia.I know football doesn't go by sentiments but the love of choice and what desire you the best.What really makes me to love Barcelona is that they play the football,instead of them running around.They always bring talented players that will make the club be more improved tactically.people always say this;""Barcelona doesn't buy players""it's not like,they are lacking money.We do essential purchasing of players to save more money.You have to save money for players to enable you to pay them on time.As normal humanbeings,you have to know how to spend money,where,when to spend it.it's not because you have more money then you lavish it.So,i love my team and my staff and how they run things in my team.The facts should not be hidden Barcelona is the best club team in the world,you like or not. It's really dangerous. we bocome not only older but also wiser .we learn but the most useful thing to learn is to get in alot of experiences & for sure to make mistakes .but we have to be honest with our selves by admitting our mistakes to avoid them in the future . now days, there are many type of transport in the world ,bus taxi,train but train more conform then else , I always used bus in city. Another ones which were bad sheets and bad bank notes from damaged apparently,would be destroyed securely.This was the whole working process of the bank notes and it was consist of 7 steps. hello  my name is Mustafa I am 23 years old and I am Student in collage I search for job but I don't find a job I wish that my country become a great country and better and I wish to married who I love her  thank you Therefore, pedestrians who had never rode bicycle in campus even do not know that the half is for bicycle users. I don´t have friends who like swimming, almost like football or similar teams sports, and always I go alone it isn´t boring for me furthermore, I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I haven´t wait anybody. I like going to the cinema, get out with my friends,  to playing the counter strike, walking to the park, going the shopping and can't stand watching the blood. Three words that describe me really good is: happy funny and sometimes bothersome A thing that i would like that people knew is that its not a good idea that wake me when im sleeping. It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs.In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us.In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable. In these diagrams below,the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly.The first step,the bank notes should be desinged concidering some constructions,like background color,artwork and security issues,After it was prepared,skilled machinists would make preparaation of metal plates in the second step.Then,sheets of bank notes would be printed by 50 bank notes per sheet,which have colour imagines on both sides in special ink.After printing well,these sheets would be manually inspected closely.It was the most important step during the whole processing.And then,some  sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets  which would be cut into and separated into equal ones andpacked and depatched to where they are demanded. I sometimes cannot park in the parking slot, just leaving them. When bicycles are not well arrayed, it is hard to unpark and bicycles can fall down in harsh weather. Sundully happanned sonething, I need to work to play my  studuies in the High  school, so the life changes anyway, I needed to stop my favourite sport, because I should need to study in that moment it was more important for me. Secondly, it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting a time in waiting a specific time to move or even waste a time in waiting a public transportation to reach all point it should get it , but in the other side when  you have your own transport or a private transport is get a right to choose time of trip or when you want to move or stay, and nowadays we cannot waste our time in taking public transport."	1.5
120	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"When he was just about cursing the final line he got hurt and his mussels was dying and star to peel off a black matter, at that point the guys in suit thought that he won’t be able to cross the line , but when they saw that he kept running, they freeze the time and run after him, he stopped for a moment but then , he start running again and when he cross the line he woke up in a red somber fluid, he was wiped out from the matrix, he opened his eyes and saw a flying robot, suddenly he was on a wood wheelchair and they said that he would never be able to walk again , besides that, he stands up and tried to walk again. Thirdly,Public toilets has been opened for the public to elminate attitude of urinating in the public places.Town council not only encourage people to planting or garndening,it subsidise money for their green improvements.Example,free fertilizers,water pump failitiesand pesticides. We have Eather first than people thanour house.Eather is our home,we all have to protect it.But now people are distroy it.Just for mony for more house but if we destroy it we will all die our money will gone our house will gone we will have nothing.Beside some people destroy farland to build houses but if one day there is no farmland than what should we eat?Nothing at that time we can eat nothing!So what should we do? By doing a part-time job, university students acquire the living skills that will never be gained within class. That was me, I never liked studying, I never found myself in those subjects, but it wasn't the big deal to me, I hated is being seen as unsuccessful or a loser, as I wasn't that, I knew that I'm clever enough to study all these subjects and do well in exams so I can get high marks but they're all didn't get that, they judged me for my marks but marks don't form brains or thoughts, marks isn't the only way that makes you great now and then in the future. Firstly, the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel.Secondly, the public vehicle route are more far than usual route.Thirdly,it is also crowded and no privacy.Finally,there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker. the development technology and Industry very fast , so the public transport no future , Must be Interesting the development transport Even fits the times. I strongly believe that grammar is not the most important element to speak English, if you know grammar you only know certain rules to write, but I think that speaking is most important than writing, because when you go to anyplace in the world, you have to be prepared to talk and understand whatever they say to you; in this part you may notice that if you don't know vocabulary, you wouldn't unsderstand anything; but here is another topic, whether you understand or not, you have to notice the way that people talk to you, and try to realize what the person is trying to say. Sometimes, some tv shows are so great that helps you in determinate class,for example, Animal Plante can help you in biology, The History can help in history, etc... In my opinion the television can be good as books, and can also be a form of learning as good as only reads books, because TV is something fun, so you can learn and have fun at the same time. They were talking about their lives and  he remembered like he knew her on the bus, maybe  she have always been the woman of his live he looked at eyes and smile he wants to ask her whether now is not late to satart to know her but he decided leave the pub he walked to exit. The knowledge gained in class is taught to be used by the students towards their future career. There is an old saying that practice makes perfect. Applying the knowledge into practical use, the student will have a deeper understanding of what he had learnt. However if this situation not change and if our government not take providence about this important subject will be the end of the transport public and will more convenient to use car. I like a car as well,but when I have to driving a car I have to think about parking a lot and I can't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am having travel,so the public transport is making connection with human beings.It is why I think public transport is really important for public and there are a lot of important thing is having a possble in the future. Due to the two reasons above, the significance of having a part-time job for a university student is quite clear."	1.5

"Dear editor, I think that computers are a good thing to have in the house. The son of Lucy and her husband one day he went to caved holes in the dirt for make a game, he make five holes and in the last one he found a brilliant jewelry that had been generations of gods so he started throwing that for play, one time that he take the jewelry, it consume the mind of the little guy and that cause that the jewelry liberated some sounds that only giants can hear so a mountain stand up that was the face of a giant and he perceive negative waves so he kill the guy because he had the most important relic of the gods. For example, they make @CAPS1 easier to keep in touch with far away friends and family, they help you learn things or know the important news, and their also very entertaining to people of all ages. This is why computers are one of the most valuable things to have in your home. as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! Computers can serve that purpose because someone can use facebook, twitter, or skype when using one. cell phone I chose this invention that I think that helped to humanity to communicate more easily,  Motorola It was the first doing something to a mobile phone  was on 3 April 1973 the first to do so was an employee of Martin Cooper Cooper made mobile phone history in April 1973 when he made the first ever call on a handheld mobile phone After that, with the new technology they could invent new and better dispositives for the needs of users  ""taken from https://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/guides/history-of-mobile-phones/"" To our relief,she was saved and when we went to granny room,we saw smile on her face.We were also happy,but in Michael head came a lot of things.He knew that if we escape at that moment when the granny was at the ground,she would most probably die.Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Them they drink a cafe that give them many energy to construct faster the building, this café has a combination for the people can to live all the night. Many people like to use educational computer games to prepare their elementary - schoolers for school. ""@CAPS1's fun and gets my son prepared!"" says a local mother as she talks about a computer game. Studies show that computer games are @PERCENT1 better at preparing a child for school than textbooks and worksheets. n the town he tries that the people have to aware about the sitiations and they take care  the environment   On the other hand, the ask is if this solution could be enough or no. When on a computer, anyone can play cards, chess, pinball or game websites like addictinggames.com, go on youtube.com to watch videos, or much much more. Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real. Also, after taking a poll. We were all excited, those from Lala Band minunate.Their voices have positive vibration through their musical and give you a good feeling.On the scene moves very well and know how to take pleasure to the public.I am feeling wonderful and my promise is that when going to have a special occasion to go to a concert supported by Lala Band, you will be with me.As like this in all my heart.I hope as those recounted by me in this mail and you feel a slight vibration from the concert. Above all,the design is the most previous way we should know,which is considered with the background color and artwork.Secondly,we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinsts.And the we need printing and inspection.Eventually,the most essential part comes out,we need significate the quality of the sheets.If it's good,packing and distributin whereas the others shoulde be distroyed as well. I played so good that everyone gave me congratulations but thats not all one of the best team of the world wanted too take me. However, I think the main ones are to keep in touch with friends and family, to use the computer for educational purposes, and for entertainment. I'm very grateful for the computer in my house because I use @CAPS1 everyday for those purposes, and so does everyone else in my family. I think that any one wants to start sport can play squach which  gives stretched  and  healthy body,in the same time this sport can be played for a long time of period without caring about the age."	1.5

"Dear @PERSON2 - @CAPS1, I strongly suggest that people do not spend as much time on computers as they do comently. But why public transport have no future to stand and keep going?, that's because of the people that changing their mind, they start like having their own way to travel, Privacy also an important reason, people need to have a private means of transportation. Both these things are better for people's body and mind, and one more useful later in life. If the  print sheets has good quality ,they will packing and distribution.some partially damaged  will cut into separate or packede or dispatched .The bad sheets will disposal ,the destroyed will be secure. First, exercising is an exellent alternative to sitting at a computer screen. A recent study by @ORGANIZATION3 and the @ORGANIZATION1 studies found that an average person spent five hours per day on the computer. By cutting out at least some @ORGANIZATION1 these hours, people will be able to make time for more exercise in their daily routine. Also, @PERSON3 at @ORGANIZATION4 says that ""@PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people do not exercise enough in the @LOCATION1 alone."" in a car accident , when she her what happened with her brother she was so nervous then the miracle happened she found a big suitcase in the train she decided to open the bag because no one was in the train so she opened the bag she surprised when she saw  a lot of money inside the bag  . I do currently master but I can devote myself to the Fellowship Especially since I finished the Pre-Masters and now I need only follow-up from time to time with my guide Academic, so I have the time for the Fellowship . There are so many possibilities in exercising @CAPS2 people do not use their computer as much. Everyone eagerly waiting for the ambulance arrival but still not yet reached the reason is our college location is little far from the city that's why it is getting late. Tottaly l think changing is ignorable but we can control it to make our life better,specially about food that is most important aspect of ourlife but we don't pay attention to it enough. A study at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that people who spend three hours or less on their computers have up to @PERCENT2 better social, verbal, and quick-thinking skills. MOTASSEM is nice and lovely fiance he love his job as he is Patient will dong has jop .he is  a  hard worker he has amazing laughs     .When you started  talk with him you will be inspire by his knowledge and his way of talk he have the talent to Convinces  thought. I try to spend at least three hours a day spending time with family and friends and I have good relationships with them. Already public transport have been improvement and that makes comfortable to go on a trip,but I think that will be able to become good quality more and more,because so many people expectation. Some people @MONTH1 say people can talk to people online so this is social skills, but in fact people gain better social skills from person-to-person interactions because they must use quick thinking and their emotions too. Altogether, I strongly believe spending less time on the computer is the best way to stay heathy mentally and physically. But today, Things are getting change and technology marked a significant role in our life, Automobile segment increased its vertical and having a car becomes a need from luxory."	1.5
123	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"After waiting an hour the time comes and bravely  with high confident level he walke to the office. ? ?? In my opinion, I believe that smoking should be completely banned. Then ,preparation of mental plates and skilled machinists are the needments.Printing is the next step ,.Usually ,sheets of bank notes printed ,because there are some special require for the printing ,solour of both sides,special ink ,images slightly raised. The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots. Smoking negatively affects our society through environmental problems, economic problems, health risks to others, and especially health problems it cause within children. There is no reason to smoke cigarettes and doing so does not benefit anyone in any way. However, they have some disadvantages with a public transport, they gave many traffic jam, this is because the bus a large and difficult to control . The only difference is that with smoking the affects are not visible immediately because it has long term affects. Banning smoking in public will ultimately increase the quality of life and in turn will better society as a whole. At last I agree that completely smoke-free places are the ideal, and some businesses have taken the decision to go completely smoke-free. i love my family special my little sister, she has sixteen years old, i consider my best friend because i used to tell her everything of my life."	1.5

I can tell you that I fell I can understand over 90% when I'm listening and when I´m Reading, but my main problem with English is of course when I must speak: I fell my self horrible without confidence, I think that always I'm thinking in Epanish and after makind the translation to English, may be in this moment when I'm writing this composition I'm making the same wrong. In fact, in Korea University has mentor program and I heard about this from my friends who are students of Korea University. They say it is very good program, and I also think this program is good for students. So for finish competition with pleasure I needed work out plan witch is diary day by day about our jogging distance, time, mood during work out. But I think that the future is the public transport, we need preserve nature, this is an imperative for our world, then the solution have to take the point that the governments do more invest in public transport, so the people don´t need to get a car for being able to have a job and don´t need it for normal development of their lives. Nowadays, the transportation become more prefect,and the people'life become more convenient.Althought this change lend the life of people efficient,the problem should not be ignored.It would really be helpful if the government make tighter resrictions,in today's world ,lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission, they are destroyed the forest,farmland and wetland,charging waster water and emitting greenhouse gas,it lead to a serious enviorment problem.So the government should oversee this companies ,and if companies do not obey the rules or laws ,it will be fined and closed. If you make many friends,  you can enjoy your university life with your friends. He selected people to into in a chinese room, there was a computer in chinese language with diferente symbols, the american was a diferente behavior, they did not understand what was in the computer screen. Spent half an hour after we arrived, started coming everybody, there were many greetings, thanks, hugs, kisses, and then we all went to the table, which was magnificently structured, plenty of food of all kinds, drinks, but we were all waiting for the main course, also the food was magnificent, but the best part was when the couple went to the pool, we were lucky we had an amazing wedding planner who arranged the magnificent and fun activities, he said to the bride and groom enter each an inflatable ball and try walking on the water as long as withstand, and the bride won because the groom slipped and fell after them, out of the ball, fell into the water, and kissed. If they have mentor, they can know some information. But in some country, You can use underground (metro) , it is very advanced than old types like Bus or Taxi,The underground is faster and clean and arranged . Her mom die because some things or someone drag her of the leg and drop it in a cave were other animals eat her. Hey my name is Joe and i´m 21 years old and i´l think i´l would compliment the summer camp very good, because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak. They study some information about that they do not know about that in order to give this information to their student. he jump from his bed to the street and walk to his way to see what he did every morning.when he walk after the stranger man  he notice that he stopped in every trash in the street to take a look and go to the next one, and guess what he saw Michael and run away also Michael was afraid. In conclusion, I think this program is very good. Therefore, if our university has this program, students can be more happy and friendly and more love our university. Then, I hope that our university has mentor program."	1.5
125	"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"To sum it up I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convinient.Public future unless they have project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger. As I told you before because of the technology many things has become able in less time, and with the pass of the years this tend to increase. Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real. One @MONTH1 be prompted to ask, what kind of lesson could you possibly learn in a hall? All I will tell you is this, it's not one I'll be forgetting any time soon. However if this situation not change and if our government not take providence about this important subject will be the end of the transport public and will more convenient to use car. There is not so much traffic, and my senses and lounges perceive and respire all the smell that flowers,  land, the First, I walk slowly and then I begin to walk as soon as possible to improve my fitness and I end walking 5 turns in the park. Leadership isn't really your conventional class from the perspective of an outsider. Kids running about the school like loose mice @MONTH1 give off an appearance of impropriety, but an appearance is all it was. If the person want to become bowler then concentrate on running,action,stance and for batsmen need concentration on lag and bat coordination,eye and bat coordination,discover some shots which became key factor in batting. Leadership directly preceded myleast favorite class of the day, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I simply detested that class. FILM: LUCY (2014) TThe plot of this film is about a 25 naive woman that was living and studying in Taiwan and one night went out for clubbing and met a nutter guy that involved her in a seedy drug smuggling issue with a Corean criminal band that forced her to be a mule drug. In our earth, Hunderds of millions prople living in here.Except us, There are also a large number of wildlife. It wasn't that I was bad at it or anything because really, I wasn't. One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance,  homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately.He had to buy a present for his girlfriend´s birthday but it was Sunday and all stores were closed so he had to found a solution.A few hours,he was walking by a garden,and suddenly,he saw the most beautiful flowers that he has ever seen,so he picked them up.However,flowers weren´t enough so he decided to think in anything else.Several hours later,he found an open sweet shop and he bought some bonbons for her.Finally,he had found the present and before the end of the day he ran quickly to his girlfriend's house.If you don't want to pass this situation,you must always do things with time. Everyone eagerly waiting for the ambulance arrival but still not yet reached the reason is our college location is little far from the city that's why it is getting late. The the type of person you could see wielding a yard stick as a deadly weapon. The day of the competition and I came  with others  to show how I'd practiced.Then instructor said my name and I went out on the Tatami.when I left I had a special feeling many people look and clapping.It took 3 minutes I won with three accounts too.I was very happy because it was my first competition.After the end of the competition, we were all awarded medals and certificates.Then as always sounded Kazakhstan hymn. He sometimes did this, he was famous for being long winded. I used my car every day however few a few I started to take public transport for I can to save up money The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots. At least not what a normal person would consider to be your typical assignment. I decided and went.It was strange because I never went to the sports.From the time I started going to karate.After one month my instructor told me that I will go to the competition.I was very worrying and nervous. We had to retrieve something very important from my car. We waited for the teacher to finish talking and asked if we could go, he said yes. We walked out the double doors of the classroom and into the main hallway, we then proceeded on down toward the parking lot. In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life, but majority of ones is totally utopic. Hi,I am Amy.I would like to spend two months studying in English,two months doing volunteering in children charity and the least two months travelling in UK.What do you think of my plan?I will not only improve my English skills but also devote myself to get along with children.The most important of all,I will take an adventure to the unknown place in UK.I am looking forward to seeing you soon.I would like to invite you to join the road trip with me.it must be an amazing experience if we are together for this trip.As long as you can go with me just let me know. @PERSON2 was in my @CAPS1 Two class the year before and I thought that I would say hi to him. I did, I then asked if he was taking @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that year. But I think that the future is the public transport, we need preserve nature, this is an imperative for our world, then the solution have to take the point that the governments do more invest in public transport, so the people don´t need to get a car for being able to have a job and don´t need it for normal development of their lives. I told him, ""@CAPS10 thing, because @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sucks!"" They die when John was too little to remember and he never know what happened so he went to all the parts for saw them even he walked and walked even at reverse but he never found them. Not five seconds after I had said that to @PERSON2, @CAPS5 was tugging on my shirt sleeve trying to get me out of the building. I told her to calm down and that it was rude to interrupt people when they are talking. In the end, large colleges admit largest number of students, so the student may do establishing friendships more from different nationalities, also it serves the community by graduating many students in various majors. I was taken-aback by her sudden outburst of laughter and questioned her as to what she was laughing about. I'll tell you a story happened  at school   as any normal pouring day  when you  teenager in school never ever end, but a one day was the best day from any  other pouring normal day because i learn how  live as powerful smart girl who used to let the other us her because she want to feel needed from my friends but i did not have many friends in school except  ""Michael"". I must have been as red as a tomato. I just stood there with the dumbest look on my face. all my class called me creep ugly geek but still little good only when a teacher want from them a research or the exams are next couple days but Michael trying to stop me doing that because they never become my friends and i was bigger to do this things ;    that day i just finish help younger student to understand his  math lesson  My friend Michael asked me to do the same to give her answer sheet for all final exams i was in bi shook why she  want that from me  any way i collect my courage told her that was wrong and become to do that in college better to start study  now and I'll help her to study the hard lessons (i was very sad to say no & she asked me that)she become very angry and told me i should help her because we she was my best Friend then i told her that why i told her NO and she told me i hate you Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. I looked over my right shoulder just in time to see @CAPS5 gasping for air because she was laughing so hard. For another,there are many different types of programs,which can broaden our eyes,they give details of education,plus other meaningful information，such as documentaries，talk show and so on.These programs are not just for killing the time,but for educating. There I was, not ten steps away from my car and I, for once, had nothing to say. The lesson I learned that day was to never insult an alligator until you've crossed the river. one of the most amazing parts of the film is when Teresa calls Cruel for go for them and take them again to the Cruel building and like all of them doesn't wanna go with them they start a war and they take Mihno with them and at the end Thomas decide to go after them and he give a super great speech for all the persons go with them and help him to get back Mihno, and what i really want to see in the next film is that if Thomas is mad at Teresa( i never like her) and if they get free and the world comes back to the normal world. The future for the public transport shouldn't be  taken lightly,  in my opinion, the public transport is the best option for ending the problems with the traffic jam because when we use a bus or subway , a lot of people is travelling from one place at other in only one transport or vehicle."	1.5
126	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Ferrari making one of the fastes cars on the word, but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac, how they were in the past.If sameone like cars then should go to Formula 1 race to hear the bolid engine sound, I think that is the best voice which I have ever heard in my life.Formula 1 it is also  dangerous sport, the driver are exposed to the risk of  accident at high speed. one day he got fight with her sister, even he made her cry.both of them stop talking to each other and after some day the boy need laptop of her sister sukh. Due to the terrible effects of public smoking, I hold the opinion that smoking should be banned in any public restaurants across the country. By doing so, one of the most important favorable effects is that diseases related to smoking can be cut down significantly such as lung cancer. The ban contributes a lot in creating a healthy dining environment for people who frequently eat outside, which takes a large proportion of the whole population. I don´t have friends who like swimming, almost like football or similar teams sports, and always I go alone it isn´t boring for me furthermore, I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I haven´t wait anybody. In old times luxuries were not considered as compare to Heslth but now every one prefer to save time and maintain privacy which one can only afford by using her/his private transport so gradually public transport losing its charm. Such behavior is against our goal of establishing a harmony society. In our earth, Hunderds of millions prople living in here.Except us, There are also a large number of wildlife. And the strengths and weaknesses in both of segmental and suprasegmental, I think it’s maybe the learning habit, when I heard a sentences, I would use many varieties of tone and manner to say the sentences again, therefore,I can easily be interpreted illustrations instructions the emotions and feelings. To conclude, it is high time for us to take strong measures to put an end to this smoking era and a complete legal system on the smoking issue is necessary for the final settlement of the social problem."	1.5
127	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.

And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Throughout the history of literature, many books have been banned from public libraries and shelves. To sum it up I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convinient.Public future unless they have project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger. Even some books that include magic and fiction have been expelled from some societies, simply because of certain religions and cultural backgrounds. I believe that there should never be a piece of literature completely banned from public eye. Above all,the design is the most previous way we should know,which is considered with the background color and artwork.Secondly,we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinsts.And the we need printing and inspection.Eventually,the most essential part comes out,we need significate the quality of the sheets.If it's good,packing and distributin whereas the others shoulde be distroyed as well. as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! My future children and I could also never be able to read it. Materials that are removed from the public are generally removed because of one specific group which complains about its content. The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots. One of the example is television, in the past we use it only for watching news and movie, but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t, now television has others function. In addition, my major is English so teachers will teach and explain by English, which I can’t catch up on lessons well in the first time. Before the beginning of @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10, the @CAPS11 were starting to be discriminated against. They were treated as sub-humans, like in this example. Also in the sort way, we should go walking to the destination.icle If we are working with  sameone in the same jobs, and  who lives near or he is our neighbour, we can go to the work in the same car, this way we use less oil. What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player ,i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families, But I think that the future is the public transport, we need preserve nature, this is an imperative for our world, then the solution have to take the point that the governments do more invest in public transport, so the people don´t need to get a car for being able to have a job and don´t need it for normal development of their lives. People can travel through the city easily and safely.For instance Melbourn,the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area.Therefore people don't need to drive cars for travelling in the city.The last point is people go for long journey by public transport.Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive. For other hand, People make other inventions for improving the world and reduce pollution, for example, In this time we have created electric cars or organic food, these things are very useful in future, because we will need to reduce pollution. I believe she is correct in this quote. I have to start saying that I never imagine swimming like my favorite sport, because until my back´s injury, I practiced other sports, I most like extreme sports like downhill, skateboarding martial arts like Aikido, jiujitsu or ninjutsu, but for my injury I have to start swimming and now I love it. No literature should be censored, not even the most radical, magical, or fictional. If censorship continues, the future of literature is doomed."	1.5
128	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 in your newspaper, I read an article that sparked my interest. when i ran with the ball, i feel that i hold a goal or a valuable something and i should offer my best to put it in his place and make it in right way  . I couldn't help but disagree with the article, @PERSON1 because, in my opinion, computers are a step in the right direction for modern technology. I believe computers are a benefit to society because they premote hand-eye coordination, you can learn about almost anything, and you can talk online to other people. How do computers help with hand-eye coordination, you ask? When you are typing on the computer your eyes are on the screen while your hands are typing and strengthening at an incredible rate! If you ask someone about the future, answers will be different but all will be around two main topics, Those last are either optimist future or pessimist one. No all is good some people haven't got money can't go to another place to another place and the pollution became more and more, it is a serious problem and the solution is only for the rich people, the solution is buy an electric car, the other solution, more economic, is the government give the money to the population to buy an electric car. So if someone needs to build up their hand eye coordination I suggest that they take a computer class, like the ones that are offered in many schools all over the country. Secondly, using the internet on computers makes finding information on a variety of subjects much easier. Say you wanted to go on vacation with your family. Sara stood and stared  here for a few minuets and hug here and bowed here for coming  and thanks here they hadn't meet for several years after they have finished their study .Really  it was great moment and stay speaking together about many things and call the best moment that collect them together , stay speaking until the evening .and agreed to visit their collage at the weekend to recall the best memories , peter who is arranged this celebration and connected with Tia and prepared for all this happen Sara never forget that day . The answer is simply; this museum has many types of momias.In 1810 have been a war for indepedent of Mexico many people were fight with other people; for example: Miguel Hidalgo is considerate: ""The father of indepedent"" and he was to fight with monarquia Spanish. There is not so much traffic, and my senses and lounges perceive and respire all the smell that flowers,  land, the First, I walk slowly and then I begin to walk as soon as possible to improve my fitness and I end walking 5 turns in the park. If you wanted to learn how to knit, just type in ""how to knit"" in your favorite search engine and there are over @NUM2 sites to help you, making it easy to learn to make a great or fix a bike. In addition to learning about new things the internet allows you to friends. After camp, I would always say ""oh we will keep in touch,"" but I never would be able to keep any promise. hello, i want the job for the summer camp i'm looking for children between 8-12 years old i will help to organise sports and evening activities and if you want i could work in the kitchen if i have the job write soon                                                                   victoria The future of public transport in developed countries is very different, because most people have a car, in   the people who live in poor countries, most people take public transport, because people doesn´t have a car and is cheaper take public transport, the pollution of public transport is huge and is growing third world countries should have, eco friendly transport. Currently we have got more than six different types of banks in our streets but as far as I know it is not sufficient to meet the needs of the environment because nowadays we do produce a lot of different materials, all of them overproduced and we do only learn this education in our home in our childhood, accordingly I am one of the few worried teenagers in the world about it so I really do help the environments as far as I can. He always says that the computers nowadays are very easy to use for talking to people.

"In the future,people will go out of the Earth .Because of the damage,people on the ground can't survive.When they want to find foods,there will be nothing.Even of the grass can't alive on earth.Thought,but most people do not be the member of the team of alive.Cause of lots of damage,but they didn't Take responsibility.I wonder for sixteen years.And I don't know if they were change their mind in after the next fifty years. so, i`m rely thinking left this sport.Everyday i get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends.i`m exercising more and more again to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world.i`m champion in my sport so, i`m seek to do all my effort to be the first one in the world.finally I did not find encourage of my family or my teachers. To take books from the shelves is to steal the words from the mouths of many great speakers. We have the obligation to keep the @CAPS1 that we have created alive. If something is forgotten, it is as if nothing happened. I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens.So I do not agree with this afirmation, in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport. many countries are truly started to concern no environment and worried about the globe warming ,In schools teachers are doing their best  to educate children how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy,also they train them how to plant trees in public gardens of their towns ,Although  government strict so many laws and taxes in the people how do not pay their taxes to the council for cleaning of the rubbish from towns and villages,in the biggest polluted city in the world people started to use bicycles and cycling instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city,also they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive. Someone was calling the door while that someone was stealing in your house... By that, her sister is scared and woke up...  Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake But even more importantly, what good is hiding the truth? When many speak of tragic incidences, they speak, '@CAPS2 forget.' for carreer has 80% under 26 years old students are taken it, for the age over 49 years old only has 20%people are taken; but if you counper interest, it is totoly different; for under 26 years old have only 10%; but for over 49 years old it has 70%. my favourite sport is swimming , it makes me feeling comfortable and left me in a good mood , i go to swim twice a week , and my advice to anyone want to start to enjoy every moment of it Our @CAPS1 is written on the pages of literature. Firstly,hyrid cars only allowed to use during weekends as result of this most people not using there cars all the week. A commonly debated topic in the world of censorship is 'The @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 @CAPS5.' The gym has many problems that we are gouing to explain : the first problem is that we don´t have enough aparatous for all of the students  the second problem is about that same aparatous are not working well because the school didn´t the manteinace long time ago For the first problem in my opinion , the school have to buy some others aparatus because there are not enough for all of the students For the second problem the solution for me is to hire someone to do the maintenance and say to all of the students to take care of the machines of the school I hope my proposal wiil be useful for you I look forward to hearing from you soon Sebastián Ferrari One might argue the fact that it uses an offensive 'n' word more than a few times. hello  my name is Mustafa I am 23 years old and I am Student in collage I search for job but I don't find a job I wish that my country become a great country and better and I wish to married who I love her  thank you A book in @CAPS6 time displaying a friendship between a black and a white man is truly a ground breaking feat. Third, this is the most important step that printed sheets manually inspected,the this sheets are classified three areas.The number one called good quality sheets,they will be packed and dispatched.The next called partially damaged shees,and bank notes separaed into good and bad, good sheets will be cutted into separate bank notes and packed,the bad one will be destroyed by fair.The number three called bad sheets ,they will be securely destroyed. Spanih´s food is fantastic, althouh there are a lot of restaurant for eat you and i think that the food is more expensive than your country.If you don´t like spanish´s food you can go restaurant the other country, but i know you love it. for example, lunch time travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emission of carbon mono oxide which is effected to red blood cells and irritate to breathing system. To take one book away is to take all of them away. Yes,I think it also can educate.As times go by,technology is rapidly improving.More and more gadgets are invented such as televisions,smartphones and so on.There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly.Using will not only gain the entertainment but also get the knowledge.For instance,there are numerous program that we can choose.It is a good time to turn to the entertaining program,when we feel bored and gaze the wall all the day.Television provides educated varieties of channels as well.Discovery channel is posture-oriented model example to educate.We can learn how do the different animals feed on themselves.Above the statements can ensure a rich and abundant live. The world has seen what can happen when things get censored. During @PERSON1's dictatorship, nearly everything from the internet, to books, to newspwpers, to television programming, to movies, to music, to magazines were censored so only what the dictatorship wanted got through. On the top of the steps is the inspectation by hands, that is to say, they should be separated into well-qualified ones,which are to be cut into bank notes,and delivered to the banks and the bad ones which can't be utilited are fired definitely at the last stage. Do not let the world come to that. We are better than that and our literature shows it. It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. Do not hide the free speech of authors, do not hide our @CAPS1 from our children, do not let us make the same mistake that has been made before. Let us educate our children for the future of humanity. Let our @CAPS1 not repeat itself. However if this situation not change and if our government not take providence about this important subject will be the end of the transport public and will more convenient to use car. I played so good that everyone gave me congratulations but thats not all one of the best team of the world wanted too take me. I used all of the things except two.I didn't have the Internet when I was child.And also we couldn't choose  programmes.I played in the street and walked to school alone.I'm thinking what kind if things were more dangerous for me?It was so dangerous when my friends and I swam in the Tobol river.We jumped into the water and caught crayfish.When I remember that moment I am exciting.I guess everychild want to investigate the world.We have to help them,to show and explain.What kind of risks they can get if to do that."	1.5
130	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"Recently, there is a hot debate arouse whether taking a part-time job will benefit university students or not. The other chart is about employer support, under 26 years old is the most higterst because it almost have 70%, the scentd higterst is age 26-29 years old; it has 50% of people are taken; niy yhe most lower is 35% age of group are 30-39 years old. Otherwise the public transport don't pollute but the car pollute so for us travelling by car is better than travellng by public transport but for the atmosphere is better travelling by  public transport than travelling by car In this essay, it will discuss both of advantages and disadvantages of having a part-time job. one of the most amazing parts of the film is when Teresa calls Cruel for go for them and take them again to the Cruel building and like all of them doesn't wanna go with them they start a war and they take Mihno with them and at the end Thomas decide to go after them and he give a super great speech for all the persons go with them and help him to get back Mihno, and what i really want to see in the next film is that if Thomas is mad at Teresa( i never like her) and if they get free and the world comes back to the normal world. The experience of working during study will make them better equipped with not only academy from the school but also practice from working experience. in my personal obinionits better to lern froma teacher not only dat you lern to pronounce the words correctly you also lern from a personwhat is in my opinion way better i thin k we spend enougth time on smart phones so i dont think its the best if we use them to lern as well. Secondly, the most important output would be learning social skills by confronting or dealing with outside people. In the future,people will go out of the Earth .Because of the damage,people on the ground can't survive.When they want to find foods,there will be nothing.Even of the grass can't alive on earth.Thought,but most people do not be the member of the team of alive.Cause of lots of damage,but they didn't Take responsibility.I wonder for sixteen years.And I don't know if they were change their mind in after the next fifty years. However, I think the tools should be improved, such as killer’s knife and actors'costumes, the knife looks like as brittle as a handicraft, I believe those are seconded-handed clothing. We as a human who live in these days , we live rely on technolgy, every aspect of our live are supporting by technolgy. He selected people to into in a chinese room, there was a computer in chinese language with diferente symbols, the american was a diferente behavior, they did not understand what was in the computer screen. For example, having a money mind that thinks everything in terms of money value will ignore some valuable things in life, such as teaching poor children for free or volunteer work for underdeveloped countries. In conclusion, in my opinion, advantages of part-time working outweigh the disadvantages greatly. However, we still cannot ignore the negative effects so we should try to minimize the disadvantages to the least extent without sacrificing advantages."	1.5
131	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  My university has many advantages, but I want to change one important thing. These days, students take online classes by zoom, which is people use to have online classes. But why public transport have no future to stand and keep going?, that's because of the people that changing their mind, they start like having their own way to travel, Privacy also an important reason, people need to have a private means of transportation. On the one hand, there are alot of famous player on volleyball who had Knee ligament injuries ,The most frequent mechanism of injury was landing from a jump in the attack zone.In addition to this,Injuries were more frequent during games than training. I played so good that everyone gave me congratulations but thats not all one of the best team of the world wanted too take me. Obesity and other thins about help, is a topic very important because the people is dying for this problem.For example, the form to prepare the food, is gonna be dangerous because a lot food have artificial thing that is no good for us. What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player ,i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families, If it is not face-to-face class, I can sleep more time or do something. And after class, I walked 20 minutes to back to my dormitory. Three robots in specific hour make a show with instruments like a band.Foxy the pirate makes a show individually in her pirate cove, The children loves Foxy because plays with the kids making questions about the pirates and count a pirate story. finally ,a public transport need more costs , because public transport (such a buses , train ) fees every year is increasing, and this problem we do not face it by private transport , Second, students can reduce expenses. Some students buy bikes or lend something to ride, but they do not need if they can take classes by zoom. Buying bikes and automobiles are expensive for students. Frist of all at home we recycle plastics, glasses, papers and cartons, oils, clothes, batteries, organics in an especial composting bank where we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials and finally all the other things are sends to an especial tip where we avoid to drop it anywhere. This is terrible, you do not have privacy authought the society have a blame, because if they do not take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored. Above all,the design is the most previous way we should know,which is considered with the background color and artwork.Secondly,we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinsts.And the we need printing and inspection.Eventually,the most essential part comes out,we need significate the quality of the sheets.If it's good,packing and distributin whereas the others shoulde be distroyed as well. On the other hand,  if students can take classes by zoom, they can go home or trip when they don't have class. In my opinion, students do not have to take face-to-face classes. It is true that there are some advantages when students take face-to-face classes, but it should be noted that students can save their time and reduce expenses by using zoom. So I think taking classes on the internet is better than offline classes."	1.5
132	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	" These days, almost every person uses smartphone for convenience. my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long. Since we can do most of things all by ourselves, some people say smartphones have destroyed communication among close people like family and friends. But I  don't think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends. Rather, it increases communication for several reasons. When I want studying for exams  going to the living room and sitting front of TV In addition, there is a small blackboard for my littel brother because my mother wants my prother learn Arabic and English letters. In the case of my family, a year before, I was in the high school which is far from home, and my brother was in the military. As COVID-19 was so severe, my family couldn't meet each other often. So, we usually communicated using smartphones' functions. This experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister (I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money. Second, informations we earned from smartphone can be sources of  communication. i think that this is the guestion for every one, and the answer can't be one for all, cause, someone can use public transport, and economy by this not only money, but and the environment, but some people don't like to use p.t., cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple don't like to travell with another people. For example, if someone find out news about a singer, he/she would definitely tell another person who also likes that singer. These days, as main media where we look up news is  smartphone, smartphone helps us to communicate more with close people. Lastly, smartphones sometime offer a chance to communicate old friends or family members. Espesialy there are a lot of greens these makes good health.However someone have to take care of them.The town have to do that and I think in England there are so many greens all around,so a lot of people take care of these that makes good environment.After I have been to live in England with my family I have goton the feel very much indeed. It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. after two days poleas sow some boody in crime scene the poles man ask them what did you do hear ? But these days, as there are many social networking services operating, they sometimes offer us our old friends. Similarly, we can easily communicate cousins who can't meet often by using smartphones. Last month,my friend came to Korea and visited me.In the morning We went to Ocean Park ,we saw dolphin,cat, horse and many animals .In the afternoon we went to play rollar coatser,I screamed on top of voice and called for help .Actually I hate playing rollar coster .We played mind train ,punch and a lot of games .At the end of the day I was just like running out of gas ,because I was too tired to walk any further. I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked.Pleasure to work at concerts is when  I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate.The experience  is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert. Obviously, there can be families/friends that smartphones destroyed their communications. Following your letter , I want to tell you about The apartment is very Beautiful not big or small medium-sized left inside two rooms, a bathroom and a dining hall and an external director categorize overlooking a beautiful view I am sure he will like it  to come and Tri condo b soon ,n the end, I would say that I miss you too much and I hope to see you soon."	1.5
133	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Second advantage is Internet by website, such as twiter, facebook... You allow speak with your quick friend, or you can meet ith them by website, therefore you do not call by telephone, so internet is too much cheap. Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe, in fact there is some important tournament where participate all important Europe team,They are called ""Champions League"" and ""Europa League"".football is a team sport in fact in this sport participate everyboby without exclude nobody. Spent half an hour after we arrived, started coming everybody, there were many greetings, thanks, hugs, kisses, and then we all went to the table, which was magnificently structured, plenty of food of all kinds, drinks, but we were all waiting for the main course, also the food was magnificent, but the best part was when the couple went to the pool, we were lucky we had an amazing wedding planner who arranged the magnificent and fun activities, he said to the bride and groom enter each an inflatable ball and try walking on the water as long as withstand, and the bride won because the groom slipped and fell after them, out of the ball, fell into the water, and kissed. Most restaurants are are-conditioned and this makes it worse because there is no ventilation of the smoke produced and it is inevitable that restaurant-goers would have to inhale and bear the smoke produced. Secondly, smoking is an air pollution and can disrupt restaurant goers from enjoying their meal and company. Most restaurant goers would simply want to enjoy the ambience of the restaurant without having to deal with the unnecessary smoke or the unpleasant smell that smoking produces unless they are smokers themselves. For the greater public good, smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country as restaurants should be respected as public places equivalent to hospitals, schools and airports where the smoking ban has already been imposed. As I told you before because of the technology many things has become able in less time, and with the pass of the years this tend to increase."	1.5
134	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"As we know public transportation has not a direct way to fulfill our all destinations then it force us to stop in many stations first, moreover we should take the other one to reach our destination so it is already obvious why using a car is better. There are many different opinions about part-time job. Some parents think having part-time jobs can affect the students' study, therefore they are not allowed to have part time job. Others think having a part time job is a good social experience. Many students think that they can learn useful skills through various part time jobs. If you work in a supermarket, you can learn how to promote products. Firstly it is clear that more house and transport networks is convenient for our people,what is knowed to us is that the population growth is a big problems,which is needed for more palce to living.And builing more transport networks is also benifit for us,for example ,the high-speed rail can be shorteded our time in traveling.while the animal may not welcome to it, So my idea is aii the coutries allthe people stop to use farmland,forest andwetlang to build houses grow more trees portect our world,our homestar! I believe it is necessary for students to have a part time job for their future. Most of all, encouraging students to participate in a part time job may be beneficial for their future success. This major involves all, always we have to consider the all possibilities to resolve  homework , you have to know the most possible information for can resolve it. This afirmation: travelling by car is so much more convenient say everything, for example if we think a lot of time we spent on wait bus to arrive our destiny, the traffic is a lot of things that everyone prefer  buy car it more practical and fast. Specially, participating in a part time job will not only give experiences but they also will gain money, of which they can spend it on things such as clothing. To combat the distriction of enviornment,this is a serious problem throughout the world.Nowadays ,many trees and grasses are damaged in many countries,lots of building are constricated.And people should pay attention to this problem and try to slove it. television entertains as well as it will educate the people.These days are educating themselves by watching the television.Televison not only provide entertainment it will give lots of information about the happenings around the globe.Channels like national geographic and animal planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origination of species.Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people"	1.5

Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Imagine your favorite book, song, and movie. The ones that you love to watch, listen to, or read a million times over. The ones that you keep on checking out from the library again and again because you love it so much. So,my favourite sport in the present time it is street workout.I have been exercising this sport already long time.I like to exercise on the street even in the season when the temperature outside below zero.Of course, in summer I like to exercise more than in winter but this don't stop me.I don't know myself why,but I almost every day go on the street in order to exercise.If  It is very coldly and windily outside,I don't worry about it and I'm exsercising at home.For those people, who want to start to exercise the street workout I'm advising to start with basic exerscises such as pull ups,push ups,dips and squats.That everything basic exercises and they will help you will do a good start up.After some time when you will be feeling that you are ready for more, you can start to study more difficult exercises. What happened to it? You think that it has been checked out, but later you find that it has been removed from the shelves because someone found it offensive. What can you do? When you go to the library, you usually expect a huge selections of books and other materials to choose from. secondly these mode of transportation covers      as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routine who travelled by public transportation.as a consquence generally people avoid travelling by public transportation finally i can say that there are various mode of transporotation avaliable  to competition with public transportation. This is one reason why libraries are so popular among all people. If the libraries were to begin to remove items off of the shelves that they found offensive, many people would not be able to find all the items that they enjoyed anymore. In the end,if it is a good sheet,the porcedure is packaging and distribution,including cutting into separate bank notes,packing,dispatching.If it is a bad sheet,the porcedure is disposal    --bad sheetsand bank notes should be securely destroyed. Nowadays, the transportation become more prefect,and the people'life become more convenient.Althought this change lend the life of people efficient,the problem should not be ignored.It would really be helpful if the government make tighter resrictions,in today's world ,lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission, they are destroyed the forest,farmland and wetland,charging waster water and emitting greenhouse gas,it lead to a serious enviorment problem.So the government should oversee this companies ,and if companies do not obey the rules or laws ,it will be fined and closed. When alison knock on his parents door she noticed that there were many people in her parents house, a man open the front door.When she entered  the house ,a man was looking at her with a bad face,when suddenly this man shot with a gun to Alison father. Libraries should not remove items from the shelves if they are found offensive. To begin with is design,we are able to considerate backgroud colour ,artwork,and security issues,and then,we are supposed to preparing mental plates,such as skilled and machinists. After we came to the ambulance,police come and one patrol was catching those man who made that to that granny and the other patrol was talking to us.I found out that granny name is Rose and she had got operation after the accident. In Katherine Paterson's words, 'If I have the right to remove a book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. So for finish competition with pleasure I needed work out plan witch is diary day by day about our jogging distance, time, mood during work out. The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years Taking materials off of the shelves would be unfair to all readers. We can really confirm that there is no future for public transport, if so, we will have to drive a car instead of buying a ticket for public transport and go to office, city, home and so on using private transport, however we can also think that in the centre has no parking car or it is not enough for the whole private car, thereby, if we use a public transport, we can simplify our lives and spend less simply because we are able to save money and time. If someone were to disagree with this, this would not only disable you from reading or watching what you love, but it also takes away from other readers who didn't have a chance to make their own opinions on the material. Frist of all at home we recycle plastics, glasses, papers and cartons, oils, clothes, batteries, organics in an especial composting bank where we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials and finally all the other things are sends to an especial tip where we avoid to drop it anywhere. Currently we have got more than six different types of banks in our streets but as far as I know it is not sufficient to meet the needs of the environment because nowadays we do produce a lot of different materials, all of them overproduced and we do only learn this education in our home in our childhood, accordingly I am one of the few worried teenagers in the world about it so I really do help the environments as far as I can. Volleyball its my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I were in another world, in which I can be free and happy, apart of this, when I am bad, this is a distration of the university. To some, this @MONTH1 be one of the best books ever written. If someone disagreed with this and felt that it was too serious or offensive to young readers, many new readers would never know this book. I used my car every day however few a few I started to take public transport for I can to save up money Another good option is give them a difficult work for every day keep them busy, but I don't know what kind of job can be, because a person who commit a crime isn´t going to do something to help society like communitarian service. It is only natural to disagree with someone. Fifty minutes passed ,when my body no longer was sore.I decided to walk to the end.Constantly,I just walked like without terminal contest.While I strugged to walk.Finally,I saw a light to appeare my eyes and I woke up. We the management of The Arch London Hotel received your mail and wishes to let you know that you should make known to us the position you desired to work in via return mail along with a scan copy of your signed contract of agreement to enable us make every necessary corrections.Thank you. If everyone were to take their least favorite book off of the shelves and replace it with one they like better, soon the libraries would be filled with items that would only reach out to a certain audience. Libraries are meant to fulfill everyone's desires and taste. To conclude, taking items off the shelves because they are offensive to someone would not be fair. In fact, I believe that doing so would create more problems for people. But why public transport have no future to stand and keep going?, that's because of the people that changing their mind, they start like having their own way to travel, Privacy also an important reason, people need to have a private means of transportation. What is great about the library is that you have a huge selection of items to choose from. If censorship were to take place, the library would no longer be a place to enjoy. while we are spendind good time watching TV our brain is not in calm, only in an other position different to that ones in the rest od the day.That's why I think that it's a good momento to see the thing through a new glass and that can be a very high opportunity. Last month,my friend came to Korea and visited me.In the morning We went to Ocean Park ,we saw dolphin,cat, horse and many animals .In the afternoon we went to play rollar coatser,I screamed on top of voice and called for help .Actually I hate playing rollar coster .We played mind train ,punch and a lot of games .At the end of the day I was just like running out of gas ,because I was too tired to walk any further.

To censor the books held in a library is to chip away at human progress. A freedom of thought and a freedom of press, present within our nation and increasing in presence around the @CAPS5, precludes the idea of this censorship. If any book is subject to criticism or opposition, are not all books worthy of the same? the public transport  have no future , the crisis in 2008 ; has been down the oil prices .The oil is cheap now and new cars are more efficient and the goverment give stimolous for consumers. Libraries are a communal institution, open to all views and writings. The point of bringing books together under one roof is to equate them, and give them all equal standing as literature or scholarly works. so, i`m rely thinking left this sport.Everyday i get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends.i`m exercising more and more again to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world.i`m champion in my sport so, i`m seek to do all my effort to be the first one in the world.finally I did not find encourage of my family or my teachers. Growing up in a small town, where ideas of gender and sexuality were somewhat firmly set, any search for dissenting opinion was often fruitless. One they animals went with Ana and give her an incentive for being an athlete or make something else than stay sleeping. The social networks such as: Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,Google plus... are connecting  us to more and more friends, companies, public figures, books, films, social organizations...we are really have many things to see, to think, to ""like"", to ""comment"" and a dozen of stuffs that we can make an action to interactive with others...so may it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves, to take care our healthy. It was not until I left the school that I found that such books did exist in my old school library, but kept removed, off the shelves, restricted. More insulting than finding books of @CAPS4 issues completely unrepresented was to find that they were treated so separately. In my opinion ,Volleyball must then be considered among high-risk sports according to the frequency and gravity of our surgical findings.my advice for who starts this sport you will get fresh after you play this game and makes you doing your work in relaxetion way . Some people believe that if minority opinions or values are unrepresented, they will disappear. As Automotive Industries are huge in market, most of the  house holders  prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time . it can never be regained even the strongest monarchs have been helpless to prevent time.So should be careful about the importance of time .I hope to not waste it and use it as the best use for giving opportunity for rising .Those who waste it ,will be behind and they will fail to make a mark in their life.The great men and successful guys became fame and rose by a suitable use for time .They guide and source of inspiration for a new generation. finally ,a public transport need more costs , because public transport (such a buses , train ) fees every year is increasing, and this problem we do not face it by private transport , we can see that there are lots of serious and frequently weather disaster happened in decades, such as typhoon, hurricane, wild fire and mud slide. Unlike an advertisement that might accost us unawares, we must pick up a book and open it to receive its guidance. Ferrari making one of the fastes cars on the word, but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac, how they were in the past.If sameone like cars then should go to Formula 1 race to hear the bolid engine sound, I think that is the best voice which I have ever heard in my life.Formula 1 it is also  dangerous sport, the driver are exposed to the risk of  accident at high speed. I would have learned not only how to express and accept myself, but I might have grown to more easily accept others as well. In the past few years, with the effects of @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 reaching the newest generation, @LOCATION1 has searched for ways to pay homage to the victims of the violence of @CAPS8 and of the @CAPS9. What the country finds, however, is that it cannot effectively memorialize the tragedies. In trying construct a monument, the government and culture find that they have little to build off of. Fdi can play important role in it.It give competition to national companies .By virtue of which they  work properly mannerly and give better option to policy holders.people can always buy nominal premium we should aware them about the types of insurance as well as benefits of the insurancce. As such, architects have created what @MONTH1 be called 'anti-monuments', commemorating a void to posterity to memorialize what was lost. When alison knock on his parents door she noticed that there were many people in her parents house, a man open the front door.When she entered  the house ,a man was looking at her with a bad face,when suddenly this man shot with a gun to Alison father. Such is the knowledge lost from book-burning. There are company so much,they make our life polluted.To take care of the environment,each of us has to do anything such as propaganda to the people in the country,...about my village, we use banana leaf stead of nilon, garbage desposal sensibly...and so on. Elizabeth apparent to be a very sweet girl, but Jason is not convince, because when he kiss her, he doesn’t feel nothing, he doesn’t feel that gravity disappear, and when his face turn red, he just put a face of horror and surprise , like if she was very sorry about kissing him. What views, what prose, what beauty has been taking from us while we continue living, never having the chance to glimpse it? In other way, I never be a witness , what I have to do?, tell me what cain of suit have the witnees have to wear, If I have to buyany colour of tie, the flower.... really I'm very exciting with your wedding. Travelling by car is much more convenient but all know really there is no future for public transport.When we talk about public transport,there are many people and everyone travel but i think we do not feel relax are there and if we talk about travelling by car.It is the best or much more convenient for us.Because we can travel any where but in public transport we can not travel to any other sites If the  print sheets has good quality ,they will packing and distribution.some partially damaged  will cut into separate or packede or dispatched .The bad sheets will disposal ,the destroyed will be secure. To protect our posterity, to enlighten our descendants, we must work to preserve all books, any book that appears offensive, or disgusting, or brave, or new. As Automotive Industries are huge in market, most of the  house holders  prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time . Let the person in search of answers pick it up or leave it behind. But why public transport have no future to stand and keep going?, that's because of the people that changing their mind, they start like having their own way to travel, Privacy also an important reason, people need to have a private means of transportation. Leave the libraries as they are, as the monuments to the preservation and progression of knowledge and wisdom."	1.5

Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.    "	"Firstly, the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel.Secondly, the public vehicle route are more far than usual route.Thirdly,it is also crowded and no privacy.Finally,there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker. positives ways for playing badminton: you can lose weight , you vision will be good etc   negatives ways for playing badminton: you right arm is more strong than you left arm , sometime,you are sprain your arm . In my opinion, governments should improve public transportation for three main reasons. First of all, public transportation makes less environmental pollution. Improving infrastructure causes increasing private transportation; therefore, harmful gas is increasing in air. This gas can make critical pollution to environment. there was also a cup in it,It said""don't give up your dream,keep doing!go!we stand by you!come on""  Tom love it ,""thanks mom,thanks dad! This major involves all, always we have to consider the all possibilities to resolve  homework , you have to know the most possible information for can resolve it. In addition to environment, public transportation is economical. One public transportation can transport lots of people. In this case, less amount of money should be needed to resolve traffic problem. Suddenly,a rube boy grabbed the little boy 's clothes,the little boy was cried loudly,my brother was outrege,ran to the rube boy and attached  him. Thus, public transportation saves more money. Some argue that improving infrastructure is efficient way to resolve traffic problem. Secondly,tourism,especially in developed countries,has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view.There are countries,such as Greece or Bulgaria,in which the econmoy relies merely on tourism.If tourism influences the econmy,it thereby influnces the environment,and if it influences the environment it influences the transport.How?people become more careful at their historcal sites,this way preserving them;Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale:At a small scale,in cities, in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently.At a large scale,people can now travel in almost any possible way:on land,on sea or air.Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations. However, since territory is limited, improving infrastructure also has limit. As Automotive Industries are huge in market, most of the  house holders  prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time . he jump from his bed to the street and walk to his way to see what he did every morning.when he walk after the stranger man  he notice that he stopped in every trash in the street to take a look and go to the next one, and guess what he saw Michael and run away also Michael was afraid. The service is very bad the drivers are very angry and stressed out these do not lead with cauition, in Toluca exist report of high rates of accidents by buses. Of course, governments should spend money on both infrastructure and public transportation. However, if governments' money is limited, improving public transportation should be a priority."	1.5
138	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"There are many types of materials in the library to entertain you. Some of these materials @MONTH1 be books, magazines, movies, and music. Each person has their own type of information and genres that they like. For example, most teenage girls love to read young romance stories, and about young peoples' lives; @CAPS1 people like informational books. It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs.In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us.In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable. The material they choose to read is their own choice. Secondly,Closed trash bins provided to the people in order to collect the waste and recycling.People come forward and utilising this bin effectively instead of throwing away.As a result of this town looks clean compare to previous decades. I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked.Pleasure to work at concerts is when  I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate.The experience  is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert. The social networks such as: Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,Google plus... are connecting  us to more and more friends, companies, public figures, books, films, social organizations...we are really have many things to see, to think, to ""like"", to ""comment"" and a dozen of stuffs that we can make an action to interactive with others...so may it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves, to take care our healthy. They want these types of things to be taken off the shelves. So,we can say that time is a double-edged sword , either help you or agonist you and in the popular say is right that say ""don't delay the work of this day to the next day"" because our works will accumulate then it become more hard to finish it .To ensure best use of time in our life ,we need to be punctual.punctuality avoid tension and trouble things ,finally even scientists have another vision about time, they discover that time is the fourst dimension by relative theory which exchange all concepts in science. Cricket has become a part of me since when I was a kid.Its very interesting sport.Cricket brings a passion on me whenever and wherever its possible I find out a way to start the game.I also watch cricket patiently.Its known as the gentleman's game.The best part of this game is batting whether someone knows or not he first prefer to bat.Batting has its own cherish.So, I also prefer to bat and hitting hard rather than bowling. In my opinion, these types of materials should stay on the shelves. Firstly,the city of Vancouver has a programme called go green Vancouver that it will protect the environment selecting the rubbish by containers at the same time there is a collaboration from the city hall of any district that it will provided a 3 containers for each house one for papers one for bottles y the last one for rubbish materials.

I want to say something about the learning of the English Languaje, is hard to get to me for the next reasons: First reason; the grammar that the learners, teachers or institutes teach, is  like the Spanish Languaje, my native Languaje. That I want to say, is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb's in Spanish Languaje, just Imaging you the same but not in your native lenguaje.

It is very difficult to deny the importance of family in our life,  definitely families play an essential role community structure .According to the experts we can't create  successful society without creative families , and one another specific part of your life is a good partners surrounding your daily activities.

Computers are one of the best technological advances the human race has made. they have helped education, reconnecting, and are even at times good for the environment. I wonder why people disagree, and i hope that after reading this, you will too. At my schoo, there are three computer labs, each with about twenty five computers, a library with twenty computers, and each teacher has two computers in their classroom. Espesialy there are a lot of greens these makes good health.However someone have to take care of them.The town have to do that and I think in England there are so many greens all around,so a lot of people take care of these that makes good environment.After I have been to live in England with my family I have goton the feel very much indeed. As we are fully depending on the indivitual generators ,that are causing multiple problems in he weather dueto it's smoke, the oil and gass left behind , in addition to sound offcourse that are themain source for the 18 countinous hours noise. the development technology and Industry very fast , so the public transport no future , Must be Interesting the development transport Even fits the times.

At one point or another in life, we are all older and want to reconnect with our old friends. Thanks to computers, the process of reconnecting is much easier. Yes,I think it also can educate.As times go by,technology is rapidly improving.More and more gadgets are invented such as televisions,smartphones and so on.There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly.Using will not only gain the entertainment but also get the knowledge.For instance,there are numerous program that we can choose.It is a good time to turn to the entertaining program,when we feel bored and gaze the wall all the day.Television provides educated varieties of channels as well.Discovery channel is posture-oriented model example to educate.We can learn how do the different animals feed on themselves.Above the statements can ensure a rich and abundant live. I am person that like going to do exercise, for this reason I like practise some sports, but the truth is that my favorite sport all around the world is the soccer.I believe that play soccer is an excellent activity, because in every game that the people can like always has to exist some rules. You want to call, but you don't know the hone number, but you know the email address. Email messages send instantly to anywhere. (And while you're at @CAPS3, ask for a phone number!) One of the example is television, in the past we use it only for watching news and movie, but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t, now television has others function.

"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers are an extremely useful tool in society. I think in the future don't exist public transport because we will drive their car.When you drive your own transport ,a car for example, you going to from a specificlly place but in a bus you go to the bus stop and no to your house or school, work... It is better from the people be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person. There are many sports grounds for example tennis cort,football grounds and play equipment for child so I think my town takes care of environment that makes everyone will be able to best condition in both mind and body long time. Finally, it provides an accurate research tool for school projects, or interviews. First, learning about different cultures helps the world stay together. Also 'internet' in our days helps to get information all over the world, and if you wish to get involved then go to the www.bbc.co.uk.These sites are free way to find most adequate information about actual events both in society and technical life. Each class teaches us to respect more and more of this culture. Travelling by car is convenient but there are dis advantage as well.As our population growing fast in a family both husband and wife working and children at university able to drive, so you are looking per house least 3 cars, so imagine how busy our roads will be.As now fuel price coming down that does not mean that it will stay like that for ever, price go up and down. I studied in Kuwait schools , after that I joined Damascus university , the faculty of human medicine , I graduated from it in 2008 with very good grade , then I got the Master's degree in laboratory medicine from the same university (Ministry of Higher Education ) in 2013 with Excellent grade . Norouz:  It meaning new day of the new year and  takes place on 21 March (first day of spring )this day very important for us because we cleaning our house ,buying new clothes just for new year .The major things in Norouz day is haft sin table and include the seven items which start with letters ""s"" . the tecnology have chanched the people's life very much.in fact we can think how different is our life respect either to our parents or our grandparents life.for example my parents didn't whacth on tv, because there wasn't any tv on the world when they were young.but it isn't the alone difference:we can think at the mobilefone,the computer ed at least the internet.our grandparents woundn't imagine a strange machine like computer in their life. I went to a  awesome concert of points of view and I know that I look forward to telling you how it was.But let me tell you it was a concert that the  performed Lala Band and I have taken and I especially, I was the cameraman.It was an excellent night.The concert was evening began at 20:00 and came a lot of persoane. Firstly,the growing number of private cars cause the big problem with traffic jam .People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam.That wastes people's time and make people feel exhausted.Not mention to say,it's definitely hard to enjoy travelling in holidays.Secondly,private  cars are the main reason for the air pollution.We should consider the protection of environment for human future,not only care about the convenience we can see for now. the actions of this film took place in Alexandrie city of Egypt and it talks about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they didn't have much money to produce their own albums , that sort of bands is   famous between the youth and they call it ""under ground bands "" .their songs give a big concenet to the political and social stituation in Egypt and they become famous after the25 january revoulation , why I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society , there is no chance for the youth and if they found it , they face lot of problems to save it and they didn't find time for other activties and in sometimes they worked in thing which  they never learn or love I remember one time I was mailing my family friends who was in @LOCATION2, risking his life. I knew he couldn't come back to town, so I started to email him, and video chat with him. Whenever I saw his face, I knew that everything was okay. The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years Three robots in specific hour make a show with instruments like a band.Foxy the pirate makes a show individually in her pirate cove, The children loves Foxy because plays with the kids making questions about the pirates and count a pirate story. By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we don't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars don't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport. internet sites, like extremely useful. Finally, you use the computer for educational use. For example, research projects, study tools and essays. Whenever that a research is the internet. This extremely reliable and accurate. Frist of all at home we recycle plastics, glasses, papers and cartons, oils, clothes, batteries, organics in an especial composting bank where we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials and finally all the other things are sends to an especial tip where we avoid to drop it anywhere. Also, I know many teachers in my school have a blog or page where they put their @CAPS4 on, study links, and handouts, just in case we lose them. Whenever there is a test coming up, my @CAPS2 teacher, @CAPS5 would have links on her go to help use study. The film is a romantic movie, It is talking about one man, Noa, who lives in a small shore town when he felt in love with a rich girl, but like always the girl´s parents did not like Noa´s life because the girl´s father thinks that Noa is not enough good for their daughter. It also has many games that and learn our vocab words. This is terrible, you do not have privacy authought the society have a blame, because if they do not take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored. From educational purposes, to learning cultures and socializing with friends it helps us get through life. Last month,my friend came to Korea and visited me.In the morning We went to Ocean Park ,we saw dolphin,cat, horse and many animals .In the afternoon we went to play rollar coatser,I screamed on top of voice and called for help .Actually I hate playing rollar coster .We played mind train ,punch and a lot of games .At the end of the day I was just like running out of gas ,because I was too tired to walk any further."	1.5

For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"When I told my mom that I wanted to @CAPS5 from sunset to sunrise to raise money for a trip to @LOCATION1, she laughed. Suddenly we heard the sound of running footsteps.Then there was a cry and the footsteps stopped.Nervously,we walked back.Perhaps someone had been killed,or kidnapped in the street We were going to see what happened ,and we had something to see.There was one old granny who was beat up.We try to gave her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that.Than we were trying to find help ,but nobody was opening doors.On our luck I had a mobile phone ,but Michael was saying that we need to escape because we did not know are those bullies near the corner.My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I've done that. Yet, when the crazy idea of running for @NUM1 hours straight was truly thought through, the laughter began to melt away. Invention of car has made people's lives easier.No more they have to solely depend on public transport.Though public transport are cheaper and one could get to know many companions ,increase network.But public transport has fixed schedule and on a rushing day not many can really enjoy their journey. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately.He had to buy a present for his girlfriend´s birthday but it was Sunday and all stores were closed so he had to found a solution.A few hours,he was walking by a garden,and suddenly,he saw the most beautiful flowers that he has ever seen,so he picked them up.However,flowers weren´t enough so he decided to think in anything else.Several hours later,he found an open sweet shop and he bought some bonbons for her.Finally,he had found the present and before the end of the day he ran quickly to his girlfriend's house.If you don't want to pass this situation,you must always do things with time. We can really confirm that there is no future for public transport, if so, we will have to drive a car instead of buying a ticket for public transport and go to office, city, home and so on using private transport, however we can also think that in the centre has no parking car or it is not enough for the whole private car, thereby, if we use a public transport, we can simplify our lives and spend less simply because we are able to save money and time. the most family member I love and think she is the best friend of mine , my sister , she is elder me about 12 years , I can tell her any thing about my life , my self , my feelings ,hhh also i think if i felt in love she would be the first to know that . He is hobbies  listen to music, play  computer game, watch the football match and watch  TV. After consulting my distance coach, I realized that running for @NUM1 hours would entitle me to over @NUM3 consecutive miles.So what if I was fifteen years old and had never even ran a marathon before? My advice of finding work, is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work.But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase. In addition, we will adjust company’s management direction in each department depend on market’s reaction and environment Like retailer, We have sold our products to KA system for few years, however, the products that we sold were usually popular consumer goods, it means cheat and have no enter obstacles for other supplier. I ran about ten miles a day, including hill repeats, running backwards, and many, many lunges. For some reason, both my coach and I agreed that I could do it. Running was one thing, but then there was the reason behind the running; raising money. A family friend, @PERSON1, who was both a runner and an organization whiz, helped me out. When I informed him that my goal was to raise @MONEY2, he looked at me and firmly said that I could do better. Looking for any sport make you feel good and your brain be always refresh so that you  can begin your day with any sport to making fresh and after that you can make any job with refreshment mind. On the rest of the boring week, I was watching TV and suddenly my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet, so I decided to solve my Paris puzzles with my sister, which was less than a half solved for about one year but it had too much color in the sky so I didn't finished then a year ago. Environment is the sorrounding.there is no aleartness in our locality.they were busy in their own work.everyone were not focus or see what hapening in our place.they use to speak about how hot today is?but they dont know what makes this much hot.iam interest in planting tree and makes sorrounding clean.some people used to burn forest as if those forest is useless.man are greedy  because of all the thing  getting from the forest are free. MEASURES IN FAVOUR OF TAKING CARE THE ENVIRONMENT The council is carrying out a project in order to erradicate the rubbish in my town.This project is focused on separating the rubbish in each green points of the city and also they have to maintain their neighbourhood as clear as are possible. For another,there are many different types of programs,which can broaden our eyes,they give details of education,plus other meaningful information，such as documentaries，talk show and so on.These programs are not just for killing the time,but for educating. Before I knew it, my whole community was cheering me and that crazy, laughable idea on. The @CAPS4 of the ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 All-@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" came before I knew it. The day before my stomach was twisted in knots, and it almost impossible to rest. basketball needs that the person should be tall enough to play it .i like basketball because it makes me happy,fit,have self_confidence and makes me active .if anyone want to play basketball ,he should do many exercises and try to be able to play it because everything is difficult at first but we shouldn't give up . The weather was wonderful, with clear skies and decently warm temperatures for early @DATE4, and everybody who came were cheerful and encouraging. As the sun set on that fateful day of @DATE1, a group of roughly twenty teenagers all with a crazy goal and strong spirits, set off from my home in an awkward jog, knowing that they would return when the sun rose the next day having conquered something almost impossible. As we ran, headlamps were turned on, music was cranked up, quirky runner games played to pass the time, and silly songs were sung to keep our feet moving in the briskly cool @CAPS4. The hardest part for me was returning to my home after @NUM5 miles for a bathroom break around @TIME1 and realizing that I still had seven hours left. As the miles and minutes began to blend together in the seemingly endless @CAPS4, it became hard for me to believe that the sun would ever rise again. We all wanted so badly just to stop, rest, and sleep. when am in the court other side participants are fear take off my service ball and am very at my position to cover the entire court. Online Lerning Positiv things about the online lernign are dat you are more mobile with your smartphone and you dont have to carry so much paper with you, also your on your own and in your own lerning speed what makes it more spesific on the user it selfs. @NUM7 miles behind me, and well over @NUM8 for each person in my group, we were all exhausted and cold to the bone. There is a man who is most important for one's life.I am not different from that.there is a back stairs influence    in my life he is none but my father.I respect him so much and admire also.He is my best friend who never hurts me.He always helps me by giving good advance.He is an ideal farmer who never and even tells a lie.His means of livelihood is the simplest.He always honors the oldest and taught us of avoiding tells a lie.so far as I remember one day he was advising me suddenly a old man entered the conversation and told a foolish speech. The sun rose big and orange, and when my feet finally stopped, an exhausted yet exuberant shout left the throats of everyone. It was then, in that gorgeous sunrise, that me and mom hugged and laughed; a laugh that was not sarcastic, but spoke of how a girl who had done the impossible."	1.5
142	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Because of the COVID-19, distancing in society started since last winter, and it led to online spring and summer semester. From elementary schools to colleges, all schools delayed starting spring semester, and some colleges including KAIST still restricting face to face lectures in school. ""Annabelle"" is a horror movie which i am going to watch this Saturday.I am wondering if i will be scared after the movie.The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was closed in a museum from Conecticut where she is visited  by a preist  who blesses her twice a month.John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife :a beautifull colection doll dressed in a wedding dress.Unfortunatelly,in a horribble night the couple""s house was invided by a satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them.The satanists invoced an eavel entity that is capabale of the worst things...Annabelle.After Mia gives birth to her doughter Lilly,Annabelel wants to kill her.Even the preist doesn's know how to help the unhappy familly.Everyone is terryfied and find out that a demon is attached by the doll.Idon't know the end of the story but i don;t think that is a happy one... Michael and Kate was so  happy, until one day that Michael said to him dream to be a super hero, Kate get so nervous saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid dream and that Michael was only dreaming but that would never happen and that super hero don’t exist. According to the information donne, the most used is the car thus most of the families has one, but the public transportation is getting more and more common for those ones who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectfully with the planet. In conclusin,the whole part of process is an unreversed schedule.It cosumemed the power which contained the humanity and machinic.Nevertheless,in my opinion the most precious of the revolution is the modern security measure through such a muti-developed society. First at all, online courses are more comfortable to do non-active lectures. Except some lectures which require a lot of activities, online lectures are easy to meet each other. Because students can join classes at home or dormitories, they don’t have to prepare a backpack and hurry up to arrive before the class starts. That means online courses save students’ time. Michael is a good boy and he always listen to his mother .on time Michael was very angry as he got a bad score in his test .when he was home his mother was cooking she asked him what is the wrong ? The story tell us the story of Monica(Scarlett Johansson) and her routine living in ""Cretacro"" an enormous mysterious island located in the Pacific Ocean,the problem starts when Monica fell in love with Martin. I studied in Kuwait schools , after that I joined Damascus university , the faculty of human medicine , I graduated from it in 2008 with very good grade , then I got the Master's degree in laboratory medicine from the same university (Ministry of Higher Education ) in 2013 with Excellent grade . Also, recorded videos of online courses are more efficient to study. One day many years ago in something place that a don't remember the name I woke up one morning more earlier than usual then I went to the kitchen and shout the name of my mother...but no one answered, and the first thing that I imagine is that they come to the town, quickly I went out to find they... But there was no one, absolutely no one, I'm scary, I yell and scream, look and look but I had no result  Suddenly I felt a warm hand that touched my shoulder and very slowly turn but the only thing I saw was a shadow that was holding a knife     I woke up and realised it had all been a bad dream For these students, it is hard to concentrate for hours. They sometimes lose concentration and miss some important parts of a class. Then, in face to face lectures, students have to interrupt the flow of the lecture to ask a question, and professor should repeat the same part which other students already understood. This process usually repeats more than once in a class, and it is time waste. In the contrast, students can repeat the parts that they didn’t understand in video lectures, and ask only useful questions in online meeting. Spanih´s food is fantastic, althouh there are a lot of restaurant for eat you and i think that the food is more expensive than your country.If you don´t like spanish´s food you can go restaurant the other country, but i know you love it. Saving time is a great advantage to both students and professors. This major involves all, always we have to consider the all possibilities to resolve  homework , you have to know the most possible information for can resolve it. For some reasons, I really liked to play basketball, first, playing basketball can train my muscle and make the body more healthier ; the second, my classmates and I all know how to win a game through the basketball game because the basketball game is a teamwork."	1.5

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"The most important step is inspect the notes which are good quality sheets and which are bad sheets.If the sheets are good,those sheets are then cut into separately and packed into cars in order to dispatach all over the city.If the sheets are bad,those sheets are then destroyed through burning. The main reasoning behind this is that since these books portray witchcraft in a positive light, they must be harming our innocent children. She always tell me some jokes but some times i laughed !,i love her so much,i don't know how will my world being like without her and i won't to know . Works meant to be accessed by the public should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are deemed offensive. Some people say that a tripp by car is more convenient that by the public transportation, but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations.It is true that travel to a nearby place from your city, it  is more comfortable getting there by car, and the ease of have your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time paying  cabs. This process involves five main stages.First,it should take some considerations in design,including background colour,artwork,security issues.Next,skilled machinists is prepared ,in which there are metal plates.Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet).Subsequently, the technical must be used specially for distinction,for example the colour printed on both sides,Special ink is used and imges slightly raised.After this,printed sheets will be inspected carefully.According to the quality of sheets,it will be two results.if the quality is good or the bank notes is partially damaged which can be used,it would cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and disoatched.while those bad sheets will be securely destroyed. It is an author's right to say what he or she feels needs to be said, and it should not be up to a board of parents or directors to prohibit that right. Most of the organizations known how is affect managemant acountant practice on them work , therefore they are chossing good programme and employee. Many conservative @CAPS12 groups have advocated that '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' be banned from schools because of its portrayl of witchcraft (and therefore satanism) and the nominal fact that @PERSON3 has stated that @PERSON4 (the @CAPS15 in the series) is homosexual. However the ultimate message of the series is that love triumphs over evil. Apparently that is not a message worth teaching the youth of @LOCATION1. Firstly it is clear that more house and transport networks is convenient for our people,what is knowed to us is that the population growth is a big problems,which is needed for more palce to living.And builing more transport networks is also benifit for us,for example ,the high-speed rail can be shorteded our time in traveling.while the animal may not welcome to it, But today, Things are getting change and technology marked a significant role in our life, Automobile segment increased its vertical and having a car becomes a need from luxory. Suddenly we heard the sound of running footsteps.Then there was a cry and the footsteps stopped.Nervously,we walked back.Perhaps someone had been killed,or kidnapped in the street We were going to see what happened ,and we had something to see.There was one old granny who was beat up.We try to gave her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that.Than we were trying to find help ,but nobody was opening doors.On our luck I had a mobile phone ,but Michael was saying that we need to escape because we did not know are those bullies near the corner.My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I've done that. Being one of the most continuously challenged books over the last fifty years only seems to add to its allure and its popularity amongst the very people that these censorship boards are trying to 'protect'. If a parent, however, does not want his or her child to read such a novel; it should be left to the parent to censor what his or her child reads. With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of population,many agricultueal land,forest and ocesn had been used to destroyed to build more constructure and transport networks.From my own perspective,I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human  and animals. Censorship should be a matter of the private, not public sphere. Books and other works should not be censored in libraries. In doing so; an author's freedom of speech is violated and the greater meaning of the work is disregarded. And while certain groups @MONTH1 advocate to protect the children of @LOCATION1 from these offensive works; the children will still find a way to access them"	1.5
144	University:Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year. Others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.	"University Education For Everyone

     Today, most students study hard and prepare SAT to enter the better university. In my opinion, public transport in my country will never improve because my country is so poor and beside it is considered one of third world countries and another think must be taken into consideration is they the politicians are horrible they have destroyed my country For these reasons, some say a college education should be available to all students for equity; however, others did not think like that. MOTASSEM is a tall guy about 175 c.m and his Weight is 71 k.g and  has a wight skin  .He love going to the beach and he love swimming .He is a casual clothes wearing such Shirt and jeans which mostly  blue,Gray and Black .If you see him you notice how he is an elegant . It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. To achieve this goal, students should learn more knowledge during their class time; however, if there are not-well-educated students, professors should spend much time to explain background knowledge to understand them. For example, teaching plus and minus operators to students in an advanced calculus class is very inefficient. The reason is the next, three days ago, he was working when a girl of his job asked him whether he had girlfriend and he told, I had one, come on you know my ex-girlfriend then she only walked without tell nothing. It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. For example, in Advanced English Writing class, the English class in KAIST, professors can give feedbacks to each student for their writing because the size of the class is small. If there are 200 students in each sections, it will be hard to give individual feedbacks. But lot of peoples saying that, the zoo can protected endagered spices against illegal poachers. Therefore, only the good students should study in the university. However if this situation not change and if our government not take providence about this important subject will be the end of the transport public and will more convenient to use car. In a recent time privet transport is more convenient than public transportation,although public transport  like buses, train ,ferries and intercity rail are consuming less time and energy but sometimes its create problems. Nowadays, public transport is used for many people in the cities, we can find different types of them, such as bus tube and train, but is there a future for it or not?, I am going to respond this question giving disadvantanges and advantages and  finally I give my personal opinion. First,the bank notes are designed by consider,thinking from background colour,artwork,security issues.Then,the metal plates are preparated by skilled machinists.And then, the sheets are printed,operator should pay attention to the colour on both sides,special ink,and images slightly raised. Students can learn complex knowledge with good students and study efficiently with small-size class. In conclusion the public transport is very good and if it desapear it will be a big problem, is right that some times you need a private transport but apart from that the public transport is very use by people of all ages."	1.5

Third, this is the most important step that printed sheets manually inspected,the this sheets are classified three areas.The number one called good quality sheets,they will be packed and dispatched.The next called partially damaged shees,and bank notes separaed into good and bad, good sheets will be cutted into separate bank notes and packed,the bad one will be destroyed by fair.The number three called bad sheets ,they will be securely destroyed.

146	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"College Education Should be Open to All Students
Many students in Korea try for a very long time to enter university. However, not everyone has the opportunity to receive a higher education in proportion to their efforts. one day Micheal wanted to go out from his home so he called his besfriend an suggested to go out togther , his friend agreed , so Michael weared his closes , wnet out and closed the door but at this moment he knew he had made a mistake . Tennis, tennis is not jsut a sport anyone can play but it's professional sport needs to more hard trainee and more time to be perfect in it, in first why I choose tennis?, seriously in 2003 this is my first time to watch the game on TV when I saw roger federer played I think he is the one that made me love this sport, due to it's professional motion in playing the ball, from this time I was interested in this game and watching all championship, so more time, time and time it was my favoirite sport. we will know today some of information about Islam , Islam is great religion come from The Arabian Peninsula and its founded since 1436 years ago. Someone was calling the door while that someone was stealing in your house... By that, her sister is scared and woke up...  Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake Therefore, it is unreasonable to evaluate students through previous content and provide them with opportunities for higher education accordingly. In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life, but majority of ones is totally utopic. To my mind our lives has been improved in these years by smarphone, satnav, digital TV, Internet.. Let's suppose a teenager of twenty-first century during the Middle ages.. don't get out alive without Wi-fii! So they make a plan to display all... The next day when they were about to start filming they ere non ants there so they search for them, but they can't find them... In that moment the ants and Penny attack them in their backs, making them to leave the place. For example, many university students do not come to college because they feel a great desire to get an education. I have learned to  get control of myself when someone teaes me , and to be alert as well .Also ,it helps to look always slim and put me away from the ghost of obesity as well .People who want to start playing karate have to be patient . However, in universities, people who want to study do much better. Since higher education deals with a large and difficult level, it should be given an opportunity for those who want to work hard with will. I don’t like Narnia, but my favorite movie is probably 22 jump street, Lord of the rings, The tv-show: suits, The walking dead and maybe south park and family guy. In other words, universities need to set the way to put students in various environments. it's for this reason that I think the public transport is a great benefit for the society, and a good way for move us of the one place at other,  I suggest that  the government  has to give more means for the purpose of improving the public transport. In universities, it is necessary to share opinions and share situations that students have never experienced in person. To sum up, college education should be given the opportunity to all students due to the lack of evaluation data and the will of college education. Nowadays, public transport is used for many people in the cities, we can find different types of them, such as bus tube and train, but is there a future for it or not?, I am going to respond this question giving disadvantanges and advantages and  finally I give my personal opinion."	1.5
147	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"In Hong Kong, there are so many university students who have found a part-time job. It seems that it is a very important thing that every university student must do it. However, is having a part-time job that important? Another example of why lives are gonna changed completely in 50 years is because also that connection between others cultures make People concern more about her own health, the expectations of life and the way they want to live it, because everyday will be easier to see how much are we hearting the earth so we will see faster the impacts that this brings to our life. Secondly, it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting a time in waiting a specific time to move or even waste a time in waiting a public transportation to reach all point it should get it , but in the other side when  you have your own transport or a private transport is get a right to choose time of trip or when you want to move or stay, and nowadays we cannot waste our time in taking public transport. In order to reuse, I convert all thing reusable,for example,plastic bottle as a plant pot; glass bottle as a food container;I bring my reusable shopping bag and refuse to use a shopping plastic if a salemen offer me to bring. Many students claim that part-time job can help them to improve their communication and leadership skills. First of all, thank you professor to teach in the meantime, the entire course of the learn really benefited, especially in the first meeting, for British English, I still did not really understand, it makes me frustrated, but gradually after I found the beautiful of the language in British English, I think it’s all because of the usual problem of American English, and so I really appreciate that you choose simple  textbooks and it’s easy to learn, and you really very carefully and very humorous, you're always careful in curriculum pronunciation correction for each student, using a variety of reading skills let us immerse them read. In other way, I never be a witness , what I have to do?, tell me what cain of suit have the witnees have to wear, If I have to buyany colour of tie, the flower.... really I'm very exciting with your wedding. Abortion is an immoral act that people make as everyone has a chance to survive and nobody has the right to decide for anyone life.Abortion has to be taken seriously in order to avoid these immoral action as these fetus are being deprive of their right since they have already a life.People had to be sensitize about abortion in order to decrease the number of women being abort.Furthermore,abortion is very dangerous and a great number of women had been death with this.Children has to be protected before and after life,it is why abortion has to be stop Second, the work experience gained from part-time job is not that useful as what most people claim. In the present world television is very important.But sometimes it can also affect us in a negetive way..most people around the world can see any news in live.media is more help full for the people .television is also using as a study  material for example smart classes, online courses etc. First of all,swim can help your health.The research declined that swim can decrease disease.Second,swim can relax yourself.When you in the water,you will feel relax.Third,swim can get more friend.You can go to the swimming club,that is a way to meet people with interesting of same.You can try this sport from now on."	1.5

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"@ORGANIZATION1, With the recent development @MONEY1 technology in todays society I know that there is a lot @MONEY1 controversy with computers. Many people believe that computers are positive towards our society. The government can to improve the public transport making a great investmenting like changing the old vehicles for new and increase the number the bus, trains and build more bus station and trains station this kind the action will help a lot the quality of the public transport for population and will become the life of the people more easy. I feel that technology can be both good and bad. Adolescent has always been the hardest part throughout anybody's whole life.. turning out in a fleeting glimpse into an adult, perceiving the other side of life,how tough and complicated it is, trying to deal with its different circumstances.. at this point you merely have a brief look at your whole life, many questions spinning in your head, accusing yourself of being a lost cause, wishing if you could turn the clock back,,but it's all no good.. then you find yourself standing ahead clouds of reality, which sucks.. life is stages, this stage of your life is timeless, no way out.. at some point you wish if it was all illusio, you need a time machine makes it possible to go back in time when you could see the purity of life.. However..here you are completely different made of life lessons, preferring to make a stiff upper lip..cowering in your own reality. But people experience less @MONEY1 the outside world when they surround themselves with technology. Thirdly,Public toilets has been opened for the public to elminate attitude of urinating in the public places.Town council not only encourage people to planting or garndening,it subsidise money for their green improvements.Example,free fertilizers,water pump failitiesand pesticides. Having computers has brought a lot @MONEY1 advancement in todays society. We as a human who live in these days , we live rely on technolgy, every aspect of our live are supporting by technolgy. It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs.In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us.In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable. Computers practically run todays armed forces. But who knows where technology can take us. Our society could continue to greatly advance with the help @MONEY1 computers. But then again we could all wonder where would we be today without computers. Sara stood and stared  here for a few minuets and hug here and bowed here for coming  and thanks here they hadn't meet for several years after they have finished their study .Really  it was great moment and stay speaking together about many things and call the best moment that collect them together , stay speaking until the evening .and agreed to visit their collage at the weekend to recall the best memories , peter who is arranged this celebration and connected with Tia and prepared for all this happen Sara never forget that day . many countries are truly started to concern no environment and worried about the globe warming ,In schools teachers are doing their best  to educate children how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy,also they train them how to plant trees in public gardens of their towns ,Although  government strict so many laws and taxes in the people how do not pay their taxes to the council for cleaning of the rubbish from towns and villages,in the biggest polluted city in the world people started to use bicycles and cycling instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city,also they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive. It is live todays @CAPS1 spend cover @NUM1 hours per week on computers. People are not experiencing the world outside @MONEY1 their computers. In addition, A general vision on the human innovation show that the majority of people creations have bad effect, this effect exist even in people's lives or themselves. about my rest of family , as I said before they are just a relatives , but even if they are not friends almost ,but I do love them to much ,first one is my aunt ,the dead one ,and the other who still alive ,but i don't feel that felling of love towards my uncle , I do love him ,but he is just my uncle no more . sukh was so angry with him because he heart her a lot, sukh refuse to give her laptop and her brother start again fighting with her and even he slapped her sister. You @MONTH1 even notice that if you use the computer too much you will miss more interactions with your family. However, I think the tools should be improved, such as killer’s knife and actors'costumes, the knife looks like as brittle as a handicraft, I believe those are seconded-handed clothing. People can travel through the city easily and safely.For instance Melbourn,the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area.Therefore people don't need to drive cars for travelling in the city.The last point is people go for long journey by public transport.Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive. But I think that we need to find a balance between the two. And the strengths and weaknesses in both of segmental and suprasegmental, I think it’s maybe the learning habit, when I heard a sentences, I would use many varieties of tone and manner to say the sentences again, therefore,I can easily be interpreted illustrations instructions the emotions and feelings. when am in the court other side participants are fear take off my service ball and am very at my position to cover the entire court. My favorite way to travel is the Plane because  I like to be fast and in my life, I hate a wait in my opinion the plane is the best for me for example when you want to go  somewhere you need to reach there so quick , you don't need to take time and The plane is the best travelling in the world that the best safer than other way  , you can see on the pollution of people who got an accident , how often an accident happen by the plane so anyway if it's happen,i can't imagine it , Eventually I wish everyone who like to travel is safe and sound and safe journey. cell phone I chose this invention that I think that helped to humanity to communicate more easily,  Motorola It was the first doing something to a mobile phone  was on 3 April 1973 the first to do so was an employee of Martin Cooper Cooper made mobile phone history in April 1973 when he made the first ever call on a handheld mobile phone After that, with the new technology they could invent new and better dispositives for the needs of users  ""taken from https://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/guides/history-of-mobile-phones/"" At first, I had called a travel agent but he said he couldn’t be able to book me a flight before two months, so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent. My name is Abrar saeed Al-mubarak.I'm 13 years old.I live in Saudi Arabia(Riyadh)  .And i'm in grade nine.I have 9 sisters with me we 10 .And 9 brothers.I really love to learn English lounge & French lounge spinach lounge  .And I speak Arabic . For example, you could say for every hour your on the computer you need to spend that same hour to go outside, spend time with your family, etc. Computers are useful but we cannot over use it. So, to the @ORGANIZATION1, computers help our society thrive. Travelling by car is convenient but there are dis advantage as well.As our population growing fast in a family both husband and wife working and children at university able to drive, so you are looking per house least 3 cars, so imagine how busy our roads will be.As now fuel price coming down that does not mean that it will stay like that for ever, price go up and down. Them they drink a cafe that give them many energy to construct faster the building, this café has a combination for the people can to live all the night."	1.5
149	"Government: Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.        "	"Focus on Our Planet, The Earth

Exploring outer space such as traveling to the Moon and to other planets have been funded and made some progress in history. we will know today some of information about Islam , Islam is great religion come from The Arabian Peninsula and its founded since 1436 years ago. In my opinion, the governments have to focus on the issues happening in our planet for following three reasons. The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , that ha has planned two weeks ago  this episode was his sister's birthday ,"" Now it is the suitable moment to announce her about surprise "" peter said . Despite the endeavors to find something in the space, the scientists rather found there is nothing special in the Sun system. Furthermore, even if we try to go to another system of planets, or out of the Sun system, it is found that exiting the Sun system takes more than 20 years. My advice to travel for Spain is that there are several types of transport but the most economic is the public, most expensive transport can be the taxi, for example.But, you can travel by plane,it is not very expensive. In addition, instead of investing in space traveling, we need to focus more on the Earth crisis. we don't have enough time and money just to deal with the Earth problems. Secondly, studying in university, I have to live far from house which make me be homesick, sad, and worried I have to live in dormitory with many strange friends, they ‘re very noisy and I have to share my room with my roommates. The human crisis and environmental crisis must be the first to tackle. Human will end up keeping living on the Earth, so the governments need to solve the global warming, giving money to sustainable energy research programs. Obesity and other thins about help, is a topic very important because the people is dying for this problem.For example, the form to prepare the food, is gonna be dangerous because a lot food have artificial thing that is no good for us. In addition, the human has achieved remarkable knowledge in the past decades; in other words, there is few thing left human can easily find with less money because human already know most of principles in the Universe. Human have already sent telescope, probes in the space, and more than ten people have been to the Moon. I want to say something about the learning of the English Languaje, is hard to get to me for the next reasons: First reason; the grammar that the learners, teachers or institutes teach, is  like the Spanish Languaje, my native Languaje. My town is very beautiful and I like it very much because it is not any dirty streets in it  The governor of my city seek to develop it and he said it will be the capital of delta actually after 30 years ago the people in my town deal with rubbish by healthy method , the citizens collecting the rubbish and threw it in big boxes far away the city. in modern day there is very little public transpotr are used,ganeral public prefer much faster and conveninece  ways of traveling  around.though the pulic transport are used in mager citys to avoied traffic conjustion,it is wlidly reconizge that public transport are eco friendly. for example,using wind Energy or Solar Energy for electricity generation we will be used less fuel what is affected in emissions. For other hand, People make other inventions for improving the world and reduce pollution, for example, In this time we have created electric cars or organic food, these things are very useful in future, because we will need to reduce pollution."	1.5

And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries.

"I like going to the cinema, get out with my friends,  to playing the counter strike, walking to the park, going the shopping and can't stand watching the blood. many countries are truly started to concern no environment and worried about the globe warming ,In schools teachers are doing their best  to educate children how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy,also they train them how to plant trees in public gardens of their towns ,Although  government strict so many laws and taxes in the people how do not pay their taxes to the council for cleaning of the rubbish from towns and villages,in the biggest polluted city in the world people started to use bicycles and cycling instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city,also they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive. The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years Personally, I believe that we should be able to make our own choices when deciding if a book or movie is too indescent to read or not. I would like to say for anyone wants playing soccer to be very careful when he plays it because it may cause a lot of injures ,but in the same time it is very nice game. Everyday we are faced with hundreds of decisions; whether it be what outfit we are going to wear for the day, or what type of food we want to eat. In that sense, nobody can tell us that we can't do these things so why should they be allowed to tell us what we can or can't read? Fortunately  Kabul structured  by Mountains and have mountainous climate, approximately this town  have 15 (mm) Raining per year the remarkable Agricultural area and forestry all around the town have a positive effect for the Kabul city environment and producing  Fresh air for the citizens of the mentioned town I do currently master but I can devote myself to the Fellowship Especially since I finished the Pre-Masters and now I need only follow-up from time to time with my guide Academic, so I have the time for the Fellowship . That is why it is wrong for someone to make decisions on what to watch or read for someone else. The sport is very importatnt of our body it has many benefits to emprove our selves and give us self confedant so we should practice any sport we love because it can change our mind to the better. Alison felt desesparate, she notice that her husband´s car were in her house, so he was walking or someone pick up to him, she takes the phone and she call all him group of friends, nobody now anything and now they were scaried. Does why, is easy to believe that if things continue with this rhythm and transforming everything, in a closer future of 50 years everything is gonna be completely knew and different. As i didn’t found nothing, i went to the place he live at and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he care about so as i continued to go to his houes i notice he will alays go to tehe same house so i decidec to follow him to the house and i foun out he was dating a girl she might be his girlfrien so i finally gota an idea, i would drive him crazy just as he did with me, that way she will think he had problems on his mind and left him, but son i thougt about it again and realized that if i did that she will try to help him and they will be more united,  so i decided to drive them both crazy almost at the border of death,  jus as he did with me! The ability to make and process decisons is one of the human races greatest talents. These descisions should never be left up to someone sitting in an office in @LOCATION1. When the government is making decisions that effect us that personally, do we still truly have freedom? When censorship of television comes into question I believe that this is the reason we have ratings. I love to work in the summer camp job to make the exercise every shop in usa should make the summer camp job , I am the right person to work because I'm very exercise and I' love to work in the kitchen, because i am the right chief in the summer camp job. With these in place, there is no reason why we should completely remove shows or movies from the public. about my rest of family , as I said before they are just a relatives , but even if they are not friends almost ,but I do love them to much ,first one is my aunt ,the dead one ,and the other who still alive ,but i don't feel that felling of love towards my uncle , I do love him ,but he is just my uncle no more . Elizabeth apparent to be a very sweet girl, but Jason is not convince, because when he kiss her, he doesn’t feel nothing, he doesn’t feel that gravity disappear, and when his face turn red, he just put a face of horror and surprise , like if she was very sorry about kissing him. If you are under the age required to purchase or check-out a book, then you will be rejected and not able to get the book. Ratings worked with television and movies, so why can they not work for books to? In some cases, some media should be destroyed and hidden from public. Media that show racism towards any ethnicity or religion should be banned. It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs.In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us.In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable. Censoring these types or movies, books, ect. can save a lot of people hurt or embarrassment. I believe that we should be allowed to choose which books, shows, or movies we read or watch. This includes all forms of media, excluding any media that provoke racism and hate against a group of people. The decisions we make should be influenced by a rating system put in place for all media. Consider both aspects that can be concluded that government should respect the human right and set up a new department which use for people who want to apply to complete the military service. !hhhh sometimes is funny but my husband he takes cars of me he doesn't allow to anyone to be much closer with me, my mother in law she likes swimming too  last night we went to the swimming pool it was a little bit cold but we liked so we went to the pool and srated to swimming i know how to swim very well but she doesn't she has to have a support otherwise she cant."	1.5
151	Recommend a good place to spend the weekend with family/friends. Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"If you want we could go to the capital city of my country, we will go by the car because the car is cheaper than the bus or train, we could eat in the famous restaurant of the city or we could go to the cinema also if you want I could visit the medieval wall. Since we have stayed at home for the social distancing to minimize the danger of infections, most people tend to hang out with friends or leaving their home for a long term. Everybody thinking like the public transport is not comfort for us, but environmentally the public transport is suitable to decrease the pollution and our energy sources also decrease. But among these best places for spending their time, especially Haeundae in Busan is enough to be recommended for spending the weekend with family and friends. First, there are many attractions and sites for enjoying and making unforgettable memories. When you plan for traveling famous sites, what is the first place that you think as the most important point? In my case, I always search for attractions there that we can make joyful memories beacause after the travel is over, pictures and joyful memories are the only things that remain in our minds. In a recent time privet transport is more convenient than public transportation,although public transport  like buses, train ,ferries and intercity rail are consuming less time and energy but sometimes its create problems. other people prefer to travel by trains as it's faster and more comfortable than cars.Many countries like to travel by bikes in order to decrease the pollution which happened by car exhausted.to my point of view i prefer travelling by cars which is more comfortable. Also it takes quite long time, so we can take pictures and talk about jokes or each people's own stories watching beautiful scenes. In addition to the cable car, the skywalk is also recommendable attractions for making unforgettable memories. In our earth, Hunderds of millions prople living in here.Except us, There are also a large number of wildlife. It also has transparent floors and walls, so we can enjoy thrills and stare at the sea without any obstacles. Today personal vehicle become pride of the life , mean if a person is on there personal vehicle they are look as higher status in the society . And there are various foods near Haeundae. Since this is the beach, we can find various sea foods easily near Haeundae such as raw fish, boiled crabs, and maeuntang. Since we go their with our friends and familes, we can also enjoy drinks with this delicious foods. Another good option is give them a difficult work for every day keep them busy, but I don't know what kind of job can be, because a person who commit a crime isn´t going to do something to help society like communitarian service. think has a future that all people use public transport then I think that maybe continue to have future but has bad and good things , for example good is easier to move in the city and you save time, and the bad , bad people attack you and steal things, but I thing ,that have future ,because a lot people even they use public transport to. One day Penny discovered it and it go to tell it to his queen, the queen at knowing that she get very confused but at the same time she get mad and she wanted revenge. After the sun going down, many light bulbs on the bridge and hotels make us delightful. As we did in the attractions, we can also take pictures to share or upload on the SNS. Another example of why lives are gonna changed completely in 50 years is because also that connection between others cultures make People concern more about her own health, the expectations of life and the way they want to live it, because everyday will be easier to see how much are we hearting the earth so we will see faster the impacts that this brings to our life. After preparing of metal plates by skilled machinists,it takes sheets of bank .There are three requirements fot it:colour on both sides,special ink and images slighty raised. As Automotive Industries are huge in market, most of the  house holders  prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time . Technology advance way to fast and it is really difficult guessing what kind of stuff or artefacts will be fifty years from now, but we can guess some ideas like flying cars, smartphones with the size of a small paper, laptops really thin like quarter of inch, clothes that clean itself or change the color and shape, healthier food, smarter electrodomestics. Haeundae is the best place for this purpose since is has vaious attractions, delicious foods, and beautiful night scences. Good morning everyone,today I want to share about is my favorite sport.My favorite sport is football,why I choose it?Well,football is a international sport,people around the world will love it so much!Example like Barclay Premier League,Liga Premier,Fifa World Cup and so on.I believe that's all will delighted us.By the way,my favorite football team is Manchester United,they are brilliant,they have an amazing football players,and they are awesome. Then I strongly recommend you to consider Haeundae for the travel."	1.5

For one, the show played on television may enlight us and give us some enlightenment.Teleplay are not just for fun,it can have a deep meaning,short story tells big deal,just like a useful book.So,why not television cannot educate us? Firstly,the city of Vancouver has a programme called go green Vancouver that it will protect the environment selecting the rubbish by containers at the same time there is a collaboration from the city hall of any district that it will provided a 3 containers for each house one for papers one for bottles y the last one for rubbish materials.

Ferrari making one of the fastes cars on the word, but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac, how they were in the past.If sameone like cars then should go to Formula 1 race to hear the bolid engine sound, I think that is the best voice which I have ever heard in my life.Formula 1 it is also  dangerous sport, the driver are exposed to the risk of  accident at high speed. This perspective of life is inspired by contracultural movements and some people call to these people as “alternative”, but it is each day more common and it let a inclusive and diverse society. So if you want to work in Egypt you must have a complete information about the job (location ,salary,incentives, Allowances , work environment,position titles , company type,policy ,mission,vision)                                                                                               With best Wishes                                                                                                Sameh Sabbagh For students, things that has a lot of amount or cheap price are the most important feature. KFC satisfies with this condition. KFC's best menu, Tower Burger, has 2 patties plus 1 hash brown inside the burger. The amount is little bigger than the Big Mac. That I want to say, is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb's in Spanish Languaje, just Imaging you the same but not in your native lenguaje. A few minutes ago,some boy who looks  like elderly than my old brother closed to the poor little boy,the little boy stopped cried,he looked on some boy,my brother felt afraid because they look like rube,but he still  wanted help the little boy. We as a human who live in these days , we live rely on technolgy, every aspect of our live are supporting by technolgy. As I said earlier, KFC was first started with fried chicken. So, 1 KFC shop can be a 2 roles which makes the land more efficient. As well, we have to promote that the people get jobs close their accommodation or get the accommodation close to the jobs, because we have too much pollution and we could reward the companies that hire staff close to the place of job, maybe in a circle of 4 kilometres, as well we could reward the people that turn their accommodation for live near to the job or for going  there by a bicycle. It is because KFC has more tradition about fried chickens. as a result of this consumer gets more benefit like lower faire, privacy, freedom and safe travelling.in addition many automobile company launcing new car with affordable price which insiost people to use more and more private vechile. To buy 1 fried chicken in BHC, you need to pay about 20000 won, but you only need 12000 won for same amount in KFC. In conclusion, I would make a KFC in my hometown because the burgers are delicious, efficient and  it sells fried chickens, too. When freddy begin to sings the kids screams and they sing with Freddy the famous Freddy Fazbear´s Song,Bonny plays the battery and Chica serves the pizza to the children, This year the stablishment close because they found the body of a dead child. Suddenly we heard the sound of running footsteps.Then there was a cry and the footsteps stopped.Nervously,we walked back.Perhaps someone had been killed,or kidnapped in the street We were going to see what happened ,and we had something to see.There was one old granny who was beat up.We try to gave her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that.Than we were trying to find help ,but nobody was opening doors.On our luck I had a mobile phone ,but Michael was saying that we need to escape because we did not know are those bullies near the corner.My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I've done that. Song-do will be better place if KFC come in. While thinking about what to change about Song-do,  I found that there are only few things. It means that Song-do is very good place to live even though, it does not have KFC."	1.5
154	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"I agree that it is important for college students to get a part-time job because it is inevitable because of today's society. Firstly,the city of Vancouver has a programme called go green Vancouver that it will protect the environment selecting the rubbish by containers at the same time there is a collaboration from the city hall of any district that it will provided a 3 containers for each house one for papers one for bottles y the last one for rubbish materials. Even though academic are the main focus, students also realized the importance of having work experience. Society nowadays expects students to have working experience therefore part-time job are started as early as in college life and internship is included in school modules for students to gain practical experiences off campus and gain nourishment from outer world. Students also understand the benefits of that it would help to foster values, better communication skills, honed time management skills and picking up relevant skills through the working environment thus, it helps to aspire chances with a killer cover letter and resume, standing out and impressed their future employer. What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player ,i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families,"	1.5
155	Recommend a good place to spend the weekend with family/friends. Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"when you have desire to do something, somehing you always dream to achieve it , something is touch you inside when not only do it but also when think about. First, Basketball is team sport when it means i need to understand expression of  members  of team and keep contact them  for example  my roll is cutter but i need to do assister, blocker and guarding when i play. Seorak mountain is a e place for your trip. Although some people think that a journey to Seorak mountain is too boring, I believe that it is one of the best place to spend the weekend with family. One they animals went with Ana and give her an incentive for being an athlete or make something else than stay sleeping. These days, a lot of people including young people enjoy hiking because it is not only good for their health, but also provide them the feeling of achievement. As you walk through the nature with trees to reach the top of a mountain, you constantly exercise. Secondly, it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting a time in waiting a specific time to move or even waste a time in waiting a public transportation to reach all point it should get it , but in the other side when  you have your own transport or a private transport is get a right to choose time of trip or when you want to move or stay, and nowadays we cannot waste our time in taking public transport. Consider both aspects that can be concluded that government should respect the human right and set up a new department which use for people who want to apply to complete the military service. The people of my town try to plant plants in the centre or somewhere is too smoke, so they try to keep the air at recommended levels.on the morning a lot of people go on footto the work or to the school or ride a bike or they take the bus.The people try to move the local factories out of country where is less air polluted ,less smoke,less cars and more forests and plants. Indeed, hiking Seorak mountain is beneficial as it makes your health, achievement, and beautiful experience better. In addition to hiking Seorak mountain, you can enjoy delicious foods near it. Most of the labours will probably have been represented by machinery, the people who is lack of academic might be very hard to get a job, the knowledge might be demand if the people live in the future. For example, Squid Sundae is my favorite one. In my life,many dreams have existed in my mind,which is sweet ,incredible,magical or horrible.However,one of dreams is keeping in my heart that I can't forget it forever. It tastes really new, but I believe almost everyone can enjoy it. But we don't have forgotten the cotamination by cars, We can use more the bicycle or public transportetion. It is Chicken Gangjeong. Following your letter , I want to tell you about The apartment is very Beautiful not big or small medium-sized left inside two rooms, a bathroom and a dining hall and an external director categorize overlooking a beautiful view I am sure he will like it  to come and Tri condo b soon ,n the end, I would say that I miss you too much and I hope to see you soon. I recommend you to bring it to your home after buying it with boxes. Another good option is give them a difficult work for every day keep them busy, but I don't know what kind of job can be, because a person who commit a crime isn´t going to do something to help society like communitarian service. As every year the twenty three of April, day of book, in my school all the student of fifth and sixth of primary do short story competition and the winner have a gift. In conclusion, you can successfully enjoy the weekend with Seorak mountain. Why don't you travel to Seorak mountain this weekend with your family? It must be the best trip of this year."	1.5
156	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"I believe that the people in a future they will begin to travelling shared car more time and they use less the public transport as the train, the bus, underground, etc. My town is very beautiful and I like it very much because it is not any dirty streets in it  The governor of my city seek to develop it and he said it will be the capital of delta actually after 30 years ago the people in my town deal with rubbish by healthy method , the citizens collecting the rubbish and threw it in big boxes far away the city. Sometimes, some tv shows are so great that helps you in determinate class,for example, Animal Plante can help you in biology, The History can help in history, etc... In my opinion the television can be good as books, and can also be a form of learning as good as only reads books, because TV is something fun, so you can learn and have fun at the same time. looking at the information in more detail.Initially,bank note should be considered the design such as background colour ,artwork,and security issues.then,the preparation of metal plates is next stage.bank note should be skilled and machinists.thereafter,this stage is printing .worker should pay attention to colour on both sides,special ink , and images slightly raised. When you are on the computer for one hour, how many calories do you think you're burning? The reason is the next, three days ago, he was working when a girl of his job asked him whether he had girlfriend and he told, I had one, come on you know my ex-girlfriend then she only walked without tell nothing. To maintain a healthy weight, you must burn at least @NUM1,000 calories a day! The average citizen in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 spends @NUM3 hours on the computer so that's @NUM4 calories. Already public transport have been improvement and that makes comfortable to go on a trip,but I think that will be able to become good quality more and more,because so many people expectation. If people can't maintain a healthy weight, they became obese, if they are obese they can get heart attacks, and if they have a heart attack, they could die! Firstly, the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel.Secondly, the public vehicle route are more far than usual route.Thirdly,it is also crowded and no privacy.Finally,there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker. With out a doubt, computers are like poison, if you use it, you'll get sick - but if you use to much, you'll die. Imagine - birds chirping up in the trees, deer sipping water out of a nice cold pond. In the distance, a fox playfully chases a butterfly. In the end, large colleges admit largest number of students, so the student may do establishing friendships more from different nationalities, also it serves the community by graduating many students in various majors. we will know today some of information about Islam , Islam is great religion come from The Arabian Peninsula and its founded since 1436 years ago.

This is @CAPS9 the @CAPS5 never go out and smell fresh air & see how beautiful the rainforest really is.

It is a time when children must choose, which people are good or bad, which way they will go to difficult situation for example they will be drink alcohol or they will have fun without any suplements.

157	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Changing cafeteria of KAIST
Studying is most important part of universities. To make students work hard, giving them high quality food is necessary. However, in KAIST, I do not think there are enough cafeteria and restaurant for students. I firmly believe that cafeteria of KAIST need change for the following three reasons. First, The size of the cafeteria is too small. Of course, our university has less students than other university, but the size of restaurant for students on campus is much smaller than other universities. Some people say that a tripp by car is more convenient that by the public transportation, but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations.It is true that travel to a nearby place from your city, it  is more comfortable getting there by car, and the ease of have your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time paying  cabs. However, the cafeteria is so small that a lot of students cannot eat lunch or dinner even they want to eat there. cars are faster than public transport so cars are more convenient than public transport it is easier ,faster and more comfortable especially in long distances so governments should improve public transport as not all people have cars I think in the future don't exist public transport because we will drive their car.When you drive your own transport ,a car for example, you going to from a specificlly place but in a bus you go to the bus stop and no to your house or school, work... It is better from the people be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person. Tom friend of Peter suddenly fainted fell down in the class room I don't know what to do immediately, first calm down yourself and I checked his pulse beat it is okay,then I knew that he is out of danger so I called my classmates everyone rushing to the spot but still he is not moving so we decide to take him into the hospital or call the ambulance, finally we  call the ambulance without ant delay. But i was so mad at him and so ansiouns to make his life imposible, and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the sufering i had been throug became stronger and bigger, i had made a desition i was goingo to do it, if he dedicated 4 years of his life tourtoring me and not wanting me to be happy i would the time is nesesary for him to have a miserable life and i wont stop until i had acomplished my goald Since students cannot go out of campus, students eat meals in cafeteria even though the price is very high. For example, The kimbap in KAIMARU is 2,500 won, but it has very low quality. Also, cafeteria at the West part of campus, the price is so high that some students mad about it. For another,there are many different types of programs,which can broaden our eyes,they give details of education,plus other meaningful information，such as documentaries，talk show and so on.These programs are not just for killing the time,but for educating. pain and gain  This movie is bases quote on quote on a ""true story"" buts obviously director michael bay know for the transformers franchise puts a lot of hollywood into this movie, its about a bodybuilder named daniel lugo who decides to kidnap a rich guy and make him sign away all of his properties, which obviously its not a great plan that backfires on him, and eventualy police get him. and we must lern children that clean is necessary for their health and on their school they should throw rubbish on Waste basket and who throw it on the ground Will be punished . Lastly, The quality of food is very low. Further to the trade fair of the last week where we were a pleasure to meet you and we were talking about you courses. But I get that food 30 minutes later. Also, the quality of food was awful. What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player ,i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families, Not only me, there are a lot of complain of Lotteria. Furthermore, food in KAIMARU is low-quality than its prices. It does not taste good, but students need to go there because there is not any other restaurant. After two years that his essay was released, he will understand that his essay was wrong moreover, Michael will want to apologise many people who read his essay thereby Michael now goes home, takes a cup of tea, goes to bed thus Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake The size of cafeteria and restaurant is too small, and the price of food is very expensive. I like a car as well,but when I have to driving a car I have to think about parking a lot and I can't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am having travel,so the public transport is making connection with human beings.It is why I think public transport is really important for public and there are a lot of important thing is having a possble in the future. If I can change cafeteria of KAIST, I will make it much larger and low its prices. I would like to say for anyone wants playing soccer to be very careful when he plays it because it may cause a lot of injures ,but in the same time it is very nice game."	1.5
158	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"The service is very bad the drivers are very angry and stressed out these do not lead with cauition, in Toluca exist report of high rates of accidents by buses. For another,there are many different types of programs,which can broaden our eyes,they give details of education,plus other meaningful information，such as documentaries，talk show and so on.These programs are not just for killing the time,but for educating. It is a time when children must choose, which people are good or bad, which way they will go to difficult situation for example they will be drink alcohol or they will have fun without any suplements. Through this point, students may be expert other than their major. I would like to say for anyone wants playing soccer to be very careful when he plays it because it may cause a lot of injures ,but in the same time it is very nice game. I insist that universities must require students to specialize in their own major. I can give you three reasons. then when I have time and I see a senior citizen in the street  introducing their scraps bag in an wrong bank I explain them who they have to recycle and who important it is for our environment carefully recycle it think has a future that all people use public transport then I think that maybe continue to have future but has bad and good things , for example good is easier to move in the city and you save time, and the bad , bad people attack you and steal things, but I thing ,that have future ,because a lot people even they use public transport to. I have learned to  get control of myself when someone teaes me , and to be alert as well .Also ,it helps to look always slim and put me away from the ghost of obesity as well .People who want to start playing karate have to be patient . However, I also take one or two classes about art or religion, because KAIST require students to study these parts for graduation. In the week for preparing exam, I need to study art or religion in the time that I planned for studying my major. Every semester, It feels like burden to me. Next, students must be expert in their major. On the rest of the boring week, I was watching TV and suddenly my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet, so I decided to solve my Paris puzzles with my sister, which was less than a half solved for about one year but it had too much color in the sky so I didn't finished then a year ago. My favorite sport is swimming.I engaged in swimming in nine years old.I had gotten first prize in a match.As a result,I think that I have some intellent on swimming.Since then,I meet my teacher in the pool.She teach me a lot of things,and be the most important figure in my life.She is a doctor,she told me that swimming will let my body more better.From then on,I fell my disease in decreasind and fell relax.Consequently,I need to swim usually. I grew up in a parent family.Sometimes I felt that I was alone and not loved.However,we were lucky enough to have a great mother who tried  all her best to keep my older brother，my older sister and I for completing our college studies .Of course my uncle ,young brother of my mother gave a big hand to go through the hard,so that made us often help each other in my family when the member who was in hard.Especially I was the youngest member in the family ,made much more troubles when I was young . I think that 4 years in university is not long enough for studying only one subject. For instance, there are students that graduate university for 5 or 6 years. It means that even for one subject, 4 years may not be sufficient. Last, studying other subject must be selective. when you have desire to do something, somehing you always dream to achieve it , something is touch you inside when not only do it but also when think about. In KAIST, students can enroll in most of the class regardless of their own major. First, you should know is the weather, we have a very cold winter and a hot summer compared with the other countries in the middle east.If you want a city with sea you should choose any city in the west or east of Saudi Arabia.Riyadh is the capital City it's in the center of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.All the stores and malls are closed at mid night include the five prays breaks because we need to go for pray for work you need to know what the major you want to work in so I can help you to search for a good job matching you abilities. Furthermore, if you meet specific standard, you can have dual degree that shows you are expert in another subject, too. You must be expert in your major first, and looking for other classes must be not prior to your major. This is terrible, you do not have privacy authought the society have a blame, because if they do not take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored. This afirmation: travelling by car is so much more convenient say everything, for example if we think a lot of time we spent on wait bus to arrive our destiny, the traffic is a lot of things that everyone prefer  buy car it more practical and fast. Taking other class with their major need much time. Also, students may not be major in various subjects and studying many subjects must not be forced. Reduce the fast food that make people obese and not healthy.It will be better if you gave drinks compared to the weather like whenever its winter we would like a hot drink and if it is summer we would like a chilled drink. I think that I must be expert in my major first, and other classes must be followed by major."	1.5
159	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"Recently when I was in youtube I saw a movie trailer, the film appeared so good and days later my friends told me if I wanted to go them to the cinema, so I decided to go and luckily they had decided to see the film that days before I had seen. I have three reasons why it is important. Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath...deep one and started to dive . We have Eather first than people thanour house.Eather is our home,we all have to protect it.But now people are distroy it.Just for mony for more house but if we destroy it we will all die our money will gone our house will gone we will have nothing.Beside some people destroy farland to build houses but if one day there is no farmland than what should we eat?Nothing at that time we can eat nothing!So what should we do? this situation to create many pollution for environment so we have more conscience for the planet health When I was young , I enjoyed playing basketball.I thought that it's the best sport ever.It made me fit and strong.It taught me the meanings of teamwork and leadership.I Kept playing basketball 4 years continuously till I joined the secondary school.My advice to anyone starting basketball is to never giving up and always keep playing till the last minute. Second reason is conversation skill. It is very important because we need social skill in social. We should talk to other people what you need. It will learn from real life rather than learning. I think that the  public  transport always going to be so important in our life  because  not all the people have the possibility to buy a car because the public transport is more expensive than a car, so for that reason the public transport in the future  could be exist, because public transport is a necesity in all the world not only for the money but too for the facility to take a bus or any other public transport When it is important you do not tell, cannot get what you need. I had a terrible experience in this Chinese New Year!Because Norovirus infected me!At first,I had a high fever but I thought if I take some medicine I will be fine.Therefore,my condition took a sharp turn for the worse.I cannot eat anything even in New Year's Eve and I was so tired that I cannot play poker with my cousins.Though everythings were depressing,I still have a wonderful winner vacation with my family:we went to  Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village(九族)to visited its blooming cherry blossom. And last reason is Univ. Major. If you want we could go to the capital city of my country, we will go by the car because the car is cheaper than the bus or train, we could eat in the famous restaurant of the city or we could go to the cinema also if you want I could visit the medieval wall. One thousand people by eighteen and more are questions in my town about their way takes care of the environment.Investigation reveals the youngsters are more than ever power to  save the world from waste and pollution. Currently we have got more than six different types of banks in our streets but as far as I know it is not sufficient to meet the needs of the environment because nowadays we do produce a lot of different materials, all of them overproduced and we do only learn this education in our home in our childhood, accordingly I am one of the few worried teenagers in the world about it so I really do help the environments as far as I can. As these reason, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job."	1.5

On the one hand, there are alot of famous player on volleyball who had Knee ligament injuries ,The most frequent mechanism of injury was landing from a jump in the attack zone.In addition to this,Injuries were more frequent during games than training. While a large population may assert that discovering the unknown space can solve the uncertainties of future, such notion should be highly reconsidered. No all is good some people haven't got money can't go to another place to another place and the pollution became more and more, it is a serious problem and the solution is only for the rich people, the solution is buy an electric car, the other solution, more economic, is the government give the money to the population to buy an electric car. public transport has a big role in transportation specially in large cities like Capital city of countries,  using the car some times causes traffic jam if all person uses their own car, to avoid this a good roadways is needed, also the cost of public transportation is lower than private transportation. The basic needs of mankind come from nature, and humanity has ruined the natural environment too much. For example, too many glaciers in the Arctic are destroyed, and the Amazon rain forest has burned too much.

This process involves five main stages.First,it should take some considerations in design,including background colour,artwork,security issues.Next,skilled machinists is prepared ,in which there are metal plates.Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet).Subsequently, the technical must be used specially for distinction,for example the colour printed on both sides,Special ink is used and imges slightly raised.After this,printed sheets will be inspected carefully.According to the quality of sheets,it will be two results.if the quality is good or the bank notes is partially damaged which can be used,it would cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and disoatched.while those bad sheets will be securely destroyed. On the rest of the boring week, I was watching TV and suddenly my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet, so I decided to solve my Paris puzzles with my sister, which was less than a half solved for about one year but it had too much color in the sky so I didn't finished then a year ago. Some argue that the future uncertainties can be overcome by finding new resources in outer space. This contention is based on high probabilities of success. To rebut opponents’ claim, discovering new resources outside the Earth is a very rare probability and has never been successful. In fact, a sizable number of populace can be saved with that huge capital, and Earth still has a large amount of resources. Accordingly, capital should be invested for our basic needs of Earth in terms of probability. To sum up, these advantages suggest using capital for basic needs of mankind is needed. Turning your view into the Earth, not outside the Earth can be proper and reasonable."	1.5

"I love to work in the summer camp job to make the exercise every shop in usa should make the summer camp job , I am the right person to work because I'm very exercise and I' love to work in the kitchen, because i am the right chief in the summer camp job. This has became posible with the computer. my favourite sport is swimming , it makes me feeling comfortable and left me in a good mood , i go to swim twice a week , and my advice to anyone want to start to enjoy every moment of it This is why it support the computer. one of the most amazing parts of the film is when Teresa calls Cruel for go for them and take them again to the Cruel building and like all of them doesn't wanna go with them they start a war and they take Mihno with them and at the end Thomas decide to go after them and he give a super great speech for all the persons go with them and help him to get back Mihno, and what i really want to see in the next film is that if Thomas is mad at Teresa( i never like her) and if they get free and the world comes back to the normal world. Did you know that nine out of ten people who use a computer have improved hand eye coordination. Bill @CAPS2, creator of @ORGANIZATION1, ""The keyboard is the most important part of the computer because it builds hand eye cordination."" This reminds me of when I got my first computer and had no hand eye cordination. @CAPS3 I can type with my eyes closed. We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben, which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye.To got to the Big Ben we took the underground, but to get to the London Eye a red bus.After 3 days we went home.I forgot to tell you something about homeless people.A lot of people are homeless, which is sad, but maybe we can change it. Nowadays public transportation is included almost all around the planet, We can admit that the transport revolution has been plave  in the last century but due to the globalization and technological development, the transport sector is always in a continuos transformation: In the other hand we must remarque how the plane sector has been grown, currently is the most common way of transport for going away and that's also means than the shipping factory has decreaced deeply, in order to let the plane market blomm. Next I support the computer because you can learn about faraway places and people. People complaint about how the information about different TV shows don't contribute in the process of learning, that's why many of This programmes are considered trash, because of the multiples shows such as realities, talk shows,or showbiz that hardly ever have a good message or something interesting for people. @PERSON3 stated, ""The way students study is much different than it used to be, @CAPS3 students use computers."" When anyone miss to pass the ball or miss scored a goal we shouting on his face are you crazy how you missed this goal ! I see how you @MONTH1 think that enjoying natures is imprtant, intelegence is even more important . But today, Things are getting change and technology marked a significant role in our life, Automobile segment increased its vertical and having a car becomes a need from luxory. Summer holiday, I have been to Italy on holiday 3 years ago.I didn't have a long holiday ,it was just for 3 days but these 3 days were the best in my life.I must say that I went there because my sister is living there so I didn't have to book a room at the hotel and spending too much money.I went to the Vatican and Rome,I saw their massive buildings which were impressive and their old houses.The weather was fantastic ,I love bathing in the sun and resting on the hot sand on the beach. Did you know that ninety-nine out of our hundred students talk online to in touuchscreen. @PERSON2, creator of @CAPS4, an instant messaging website, stated, ""@CAPS5 is no doubt that @CAPS4 is the easiest way to stay in touch with , This reminds me of when I went away on vacation and still stayed in touch with my friends through @CAPS4. The first two step is to design with background color artwork and security issues and prepare metal plates with skilled machinists.Then there are some requirments for printing sheets:color on both sides, special ink and images slightly raised.The most essential and key process is manual inspections for printed sheets with three categories: good quality sheets, patially damaged sheets and bad sheets. This is why I support the computer. However,the family is near you since the day you were born until forever.The members follow you,and can based on them.You can tell whatever you want to them.For example,if you are in a bad mood the first person that will come next to you,to make you smile is your mom or dad.Mom and dad spent their life to grow up their children,to feed them,to love them! Recently when I was in youtube I saw a movie trailer, the film appeared so good and days later my friends told me if I wanted to go them to the cinema, so I decided to go and luckily they had decided to see the film that days before I had seen."	1.5

"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 are many people in this world that think always being on the computer is good because they can talk with people online and learn more about the world. More environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of themthere is to that we have a center of care and, other more institutions, we also make environmental protection centers were people can visit and learn about this to sum up our village is very concentrated on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us I am one of those people. You can visit old city and watch old buildings and castel,you can watch the beautiful view from bridges over the water.Young people may like to take a walk in king garden,there is sakura trees.If you like night life you can go to some bars and night clubs that are open till morning.But there are two places that i meant in the beggining,its a big zoo called Kolmorden and biggest aquapark in Scandinavia that called Rusha. People stop exercising, don't enjoy the beauty of nature or life, and they aren't spending enough time with their family and friends. But we don't have forgotten the cotamination by cars, We can use more the bicycle or public transportetion. Most importantly,manually inspected on each printed sheet in case that there would exist damaged sheets.Once damaged sheets are discovered, partically separate them into good and bad ones and them burn the bad notes,making sure that the remaining sheets are of good quality . They become lazy and don't want to do anything. This is very bad because it will affect your health and the rest of your life. Fifty minutes passed ,when my body no longer was sore.I decided to walk to the end.Constantly,I just walked like without terminal contest.While I strugged to walk.Finally,I saw a light to appeare my eyes and I woke up. Often the evolution is return of origins however I hope that the man in the next years will be to don't forget the past. while we are spendind good time watching TV our brain is not in calm, only in an other position different to that ones in the rest od the day.That's why I think that it's a good momento to see the thing through a new glass and that can be a very high opportunity. In this view, I consider, though, there is lots of sports on Televison, they are not too much, because the people have looke for it. You can go play sports and have fun while getting exercise. Many people do this and try to encourage their family and friends to do it with them. Volleyball its my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I were in another world, in which I can be free and happy, apart of this, when I am bad, this is a distration of the university.

Reduce the fast food that make people obese and not healthy.It will be better if you gave drinks compared to the weather like whenever its winter we would like a hot drink and if it is summer we would like a chilled drink. Your body needs fresh air, so start enjoying your life a little more people! Finally, people @MONTH1 lose contact with family members of their friends because they are to busy on the computer playing games. I know I wouldn't want to lose a friend to the internet ever again and I don't think anyone else would want to either. so, on my opinion, even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers I felt horrible because I didn't realize that I had been doing that. I really wouldn't want anyone else to lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because of the internet. I love to listen to British English, but it’s really hard to study, all because we are all learning American English in Taiwan, so when I have the opportunity to contact British English, it’s full of tone cadence, always feel particularly charming, and British culture exudes noble temperament, so British accent sounds like there is always an indescribable elegance qualities. The gym has many problems that we are gouing to explain : the first problem is that we don´t have enough aparatous for all of the students  the second problem is about that same aparatous are not working well because the school didn´t the manteinace long time ago For the first problem in my opinion , the school have to buy some others aparatus because there are not enough for all of the students For the second problem the solution for me is to hire someone to do the maintenance and say to all of the students to take care of the machines of the school I hope my proposal wiil be useful for you I look forward to hearing from you soon Sebastián Ferrari You can become lazy, not want to do anything etc., people aren't enjoying their life to the fullest and you can and @MONTH1 lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because you spend to much time on the computer. Nowadays in the cities developed there are many possibilities for public transport, like bus, train, subway, tram etc.these options it's more economical than the car, the problem of the car is that normally the car is occupied for a person, when the car is prepared for to carry four or five people."	1.5

This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches you information, you can socialize, and you can improve your skills. there was also a cup in it,It said""don't give up your dream,keep doing!go!we stand by you!come on""  Tom love it ,""thanks mom,thanks dad!

You could just sit down type in a few things, and get all the information you need, and more! You can research just about anything on everything, because the computer will have it. Maybe you want to learn something new, but there aren't many books on it, well there you go, the computer is your friend. It gives the students the freedom to choose his major and the teachers.In addition, it has a lot of facilities that serve students like kindergarten that takes care of children these employees, university housing, hospital the student of medicine can be application in it and it serves the people too, and a big library has many books in various languages. Today, we have more item to recycle as long as we clean properly and put in a proper bin, which will be use it by specialized factory in another item. All loaded with knowledgable information. Some people sit at home and read to become smarter, right? But we don't have forgotten the cotamination by cars, We can use more the bicycle or public transportetion. Have you ever thought to yourself ""the computer is just a way for people to get away from everyone else, and just have time to yourself?"" @CAPS3 you thought that way, you thought wrong! Fifty minutes passed ,when my body no longer was sore.I decided to walk to the end.Constantly,I just walked like without terminal contest.While I strugged to walk.Finally,I saw a light to appeare my eyes and I woke up. There are various ways to communicate with people through the computer. It is amazing technology because even @CAPS3 someone is in a different country, you can communicate with them in the click of a button. Ever heard of social networking? The social networks such as: Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,Google plus... are connecting  us to more and more friends, companies, public figures, books, films, social organizations...we are really have many things to see, to think, to ""like"", to ""comment"" and a dozen of stuffs that we can make an action to interactive with others...so may it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves, to take care our healthy. The other chart is about employer support, under 26 years old is the most higterst because it almost have 70%, the scentd higterst is age 26-29 years old; it has 50% of people are taken; niy yhe most lower is 35% age of group are 30-39 years old. For example, these is myspace, facebook, twitter, tumblr, etc. i like volei because it was part of my life and of life of my mother, is my favorite sport, but i like over sports too, same i don't play volei because I'm bad, and my friends that know, don't like of  peoples bad of volei.I'm watching they playing, they're really very good, but when play over school, they're very bad this situation to create many pollution for environment so we have more conscience for the planet health You @MONTH1 be thinking at this point, that a computer is nothing more than research and socializing. Most people say that using public transport is better than using cars, and they say that its cheaper and better for the environment, about me I think that cars is easier and affordable way to transport between places, because cars is here any time and so near to your home instead of public transportation which you should take a walk to reach it in most countries, and also cars available all the time, you can go at 4 am and no one say anything, because its yours, but most public transportation is available only for the day hours and few hours at night, in emergency situation for example, what you will do, if you do not have your own car, your kid is sick, or you wife or your old parents, and in general the more we depend on ourselves the more our government able to help the poverty and homeless people out there, who really need more help and aid from the public community, we merely ask the government to improve streets and the traffic light systems, and more oil stations and parking in the streets, to be able to drive and move easy and safe and in a short time. Computers are a good way to help with your skills. For example, your hand-eye coordination. although traveling by car is really interesting but still using public transport has its advantages ,by using public transport you're saving  effort when  driving a car for along distance you will get tired , some people don't have enough money to buy their own car . That really improves your coordination. Also, your hand movement will get better. When you type, your fingers are moving all around the keyboard, creating hand muscles. Last month,my friend came to Korea and visited me.In the morning We went to Ocean Park ,we saw dolphin,cat, horse and many animals .In the afternoon we went to play rollar coatser,I screamed on top of voice and called for help .Actually I hate playing rollar coster .We played mind train ,punch and a lot of games .At the end of the day I was just like running out of gas ,because I was too tired to walk any further. There are certain ways to research information effectively. This can help for future researching, and school purposes. However we the people have really important part of making it worse.Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh, clean and safe environment to their people.Recycling item can be a good step to start with clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking care by my city.Everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of province government.People is not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere. Computers play a big part in everyones lives, no matter what age they are. My advice of finding work, is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work.But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase."	1.5
164	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Thank you  very much Joe for think in me for to be your witnees, I feel very proud that you think in me for to be your witnees and of course I accept and I will  be in Toronto for your wedding. I think smoking should be absolutely prohibited in the restaurants because it will affect the health of the non-smokers there. This is an unfair event. Although smoking is not an illegal behavior, it is really a bad deed to force others to breathe in second-hand smoke. We can not stop changing but we can guide it to the a special  benefit which it makes the life easier and more comfortable.Using the changing method would improve the education system in many aspects especially for people with obstruction. Recently when I was in youtube I saw a movie trailer, the film appeared so good and days later my friends told me if I wanted to go them to the cinema, so I decided to go and luckily they had decided to see the film that days before I had seen. I believe that the people in a future they will begin to travelling shared car more time and they use less the public transport as the train, the bus, underground, etc. I suggested to other people  first to understand yourself such as  what do you like, which is possible and than practice after every success While I was eating, I smelt a kind of disgusting odor. At that moment I discovered someone smoking. So, I forwarded my complaint to the staff of the restaurant. But, the staff said that the smokers had the rights of smoking there since there had not been any law to restrain them. I was extremely angry then. George's restaurant is a very pleasant place with many tasteful recipes from all around the world to enjoy alone or with your company your dinner.The Head-chef is an experienced and skillful man in his work.The food ,his team of chefs,prepare is always magnificent and the decoration a piece of art ,not to mention that the decoration is fully engaged in the Head-chef .Not only the food but also the restaurant itself is a very beautiful destination . This is good news for the non-smokers. Most people say that using public transport is better than using cars, and they say that its cheaper and better for the environment, about me I think that cars is easier and affordable way to transport between places, because cars is here any time and so near to your home instead of public transportation which you should take a walk to reach it in most countries, and also cars available all the time, you can go at 4 am and no one say anything, because its yours, but most public transportation is available only for the day hours and few hours at night, in emergency situation for example, what you will do, if you do not have your own car, your kid is sick, or you wife or your old parents, and in general the more we depend on ourselves the more our government able to help the poverty and homeless people out there, who really need more help and aid from the public community, we merely ask the government to improve streets and the traffic light systems, and more oil stations and parking in the streets, to be able to drive and move easy and safe and in a short time. Smoking is actually so annoying that the laws against it should be set up even earlier."	1.5
165	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Good morning everyone,today I want to share about is my favorite sport.My favorite sport is football,why I choose it?Well,football is a international sport,people around the world will love it so much!Example like Barclay Premier League,Liga Premier,Fifa World Cup and so on.I believe that's all will delighted us.By the way,my favorite football team is Manchester United,they are brilliant,they have an amazing football players,and they are awesome. People have been discussing heatedly heather this ban should be taken into effect since the news came out. Of course, for non-smokers, it is really beneficial to them. But for smokers, they think it is too strict and unrealistic. Personally, I approve of it very much. To begin with,the format of the bank notes needs to be designed,factors of considerations including the background colour,the artwork and the security issues.Sencondly,equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps.Thirdly,print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink,where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes. What's more, as we all know, smoking does harm to not only the smoker himself, but also the people around him, whom we usually call second hand smokers. In a recent time privet transport is more convenient than public transportation,although public transport  like buses, train ,ferries and intercity rail are consuming less time and energy but sometimes its create problems. on the other hand, public transportation takes more time to get to the required station, because already public transport taking long path to go across more places and as more as peoples take benefits from it, and public transport usually crowed and do not be on time. The island was flood but the island had a levee that prevent a flooding then in many year a engineers star constructing a building to had more money then in the city put many advertising in all thing : ball, balloon, movies ,etc. So, mo smoking, no crying!Taking all the factors into account, I stick to the ban that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."	1.5

"n the town he tries that the people have to aware about the sitiations and they take care  the environment   On the other hand, the ask is if this solution could be enough or no. But is it holding me back from more important things? I think so. I feel that not having computers will in a way educate people more so than now. other people prefer to travel by trains as it's faster and more comfortable than cars.Many countries like to travel by bikes in order to decrease the pollution which happened by car exhausted.to my point of view i prefer travelling by cars which is more comfortable. With having the use of computers many people don't properly know how to use and find information in books. Also being around computers and using them so much is pulling families further apart and stopping humans from being more interactive with nature and the environment. When I was young , I enjoyed playing basketball.I thought that it's the best sport ever.It made me fit and strong.It taught me the meanings of teamwork and leadership.I Kept playing basketball 4 years continuously till I joined the secondary school.My advice to anyone starting basketball is to never giving up and always keep playing till the last minute. There are some big shelves in center of market are divided to some different parts for kinds of goods like Dried fruit, nuts, flour, condiment, beans, grains, rice, etc. Our Mistakes mistake made us better than before if in life we had't got any mistake  we wouldn't succeed that's why  the mistakes are very important in life and I believe  our mistake improve us so but in another way there just one mistake and you could not come back or arranged your mistake As well as parents/adults, they use it to get their work done and use it as a easy communication with co-workers. One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance,  homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society. I know for certain that in my family, my mother, nor my father, nor my brother, nor I could go through a day without using a computer. The last mistake that I have had to have been when I changed the telephone company because since I changed I have many troubles. There is less family time and comunication between family members these days, due to computers. Insead of spending time with the family, teens prefer spending time on the computer chatting with their friends. I bet if there was a poll was taken on how much family time has been taken away in households because of computers I almost garentee it would be quite a large amount. i love my family special my little sister, she has sixteen years old, i consider my best friend because i used to tell her everything of my life. he jump from his bed to the street and walk to his way to see what he did every morning.when he walk after the stranger man  he notice that he stopped in every trash in the street to take a look and go to the next one, and guess what he saw Michael and run away also Michael was afraid. Using computer keeps people inside and not exposed to nature. Norouz:  It meaning new day of the new year and  takes place on 21 March (first day of spring )this day very important for us because we cleaning our house ,buying new clothes just for new year .The major things in Norouz day is haft sin table and include the seven items which start with letters ""s"" . Not only is it just taking care of our earth, but it is also the fact that not many people these days go out and get the fresh air they need as much as they really should. Most likely not all of that is due to the use of computers, but I bet a great deal of it is. I think my town really take care of the environment,because there are a lot of parkｓ in this town and these are very clean.However　some people are not care of environment　that mean some people throw garbage away in the park.I think almost everyone loves parks because a lot of people go to the park and having　lunch,picnic,excersise,nap etc.I think after eat something at the park then clean themselves is good. But there are trulthfully other ways to do them that we just aren't very used to because of the fact that we are so attatched to them.

"i think that this is the guestion for every one, and the answer can't be one for all, cause, someone can use public transport, and economy by this not only money, but and the environment, but some people don't like to use p.t., cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple don't like to travell with another people. I strongly disagree with this. I think the computer is a great way to hook up with old friends. I have joined football-teams which is near to my home, I prefer to this team because of my family is not reach, they can not provide for my transportation fees to go exercises stadium. I believe that the internet is a great way to hook up with old friends. Thank you  very much Joe for think in me for to be your witnees, I feel very proud that you think in me for to be your witnees and of course I accept and I will  be in Toronto for your wedding. Now, with the internet I can able to talk again. The same case with my mom. She had friends from high school and college who she ever talked to. Now, with facebook she has re united with them. In conclusion, for me it is a lie that the public transportation has no future, however, they have to make improvements to this like the use of better ways of fuel or energy, one way is using renovable sources of energy such as solar, haeolic (wind) or hidraulic(water),Also there are biodisel, and gasoline extracted from seaweed.And the public transportation will be more important in a few years than now. I just finish my lunch time, and before prepare everything to go to work I was thinking of you and I wanted to give you a small surprise with this fantastic photos, I hope you like it. It is also much faster to send someone an email than a letter. For all the people I advise to start to play or watching football because for me it is a very good sport , but you can play a good football only if you really like it , because first football is fun . People who reach 18 have to complete military service is an issue, the supporters suggest that is helpful for the 18 to train the physical fitness and psychological quality, whilst opponents point out that is harmful for the human right and affect development of the country. As well, we have to promote that the people get jobs close their accommodation or get the accommodation close to the jobs, because we have too much pollution and we could reward the companies that hire staff close to the place of job, maybe in a circle of 4 kilometres, as well we could reward the people that turn their accommodation for live near to the job or for going  there by a bicycle. cars are faster than public transport so cars are more convenient than public transport it is easier ,faster and more comfortable especially in long distances so governments should improve public transport as not all people have cars The internet never closes, it is open @NUM1. We can change  everything hurt us if we need if we have volition The reasons for  stress are more diverse perhaps because  we have an  exam period,  family proplems or because we think in negative way,  or we destroyed  ourselves  in long hours of working and canceld our needs  for enough comfortable,  and  lots of reasons to stress...   We must get  out of  the stress quickly before  lose ourself because it's very hurtful period, for example you can read a  book,  doing sport,  play music,  eating delicious food, remmeber  all the positive thing was took place with you,  talk about someone who trust for him,  take off every thing make you upset and make you life tiring,  go out and eat meal with your best joking friends,  and  there a lot of you have to do...   Remmeber the stress is not  lasting thing,  and you can avoid  it  But if you  are willing  to live in happy life. This can also be done on the internet because there is any thing you could ever ask for on the internet. In modern life,we rely on traffic to work or travel to everywhere.It is conveninet to travel by private cars .The price of private cars which every one can afford it,so that everyone has the private car nowadays .Some people point out private cars are going to replace the public transport . The internet is a great place research on any topic you have or doing what ever you want. Finally, the computer is great for playing about every game, there is that you would feel like playing. Also @CAPS1 of spending about @MONEY1 on an x-box and a game, you @MONTH1 only have to spend about @MONEY2 on a game that goes into your computer. In those days almost 80% of people have assured feel preocupation about their bodies and their alimentation, for this they convidenced me that they will try improve their habitual alimentation everyday and their will do sport more frequently.

Apart from that you see new places and you have fun, you also lern others cultures, historicals facts, you also lern to respect others peoples and thirs costums.

In my school ages I did not participate any programme even sports.Because school teachers never encourage me to participate.If they told me to attend compulsory I will do without any hesitation. In the long run it will pay off, especially with the economics problems our country is having now, by helping us save money,. It will also allow connection with old friends, save time, and provide entertainment to all who would like."	1.5

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @CAPS1 -in-@CAPS2, Computers are very helpfull tools in todays society and culture. They build cognitive skills and offer a vast wealth of knowledge. I want you to understand all the benefits a computer provides. I will tell you a review of a thriller, the thriller is Hunger games it is about some capitals and people are choised and play on a game, you have to kill persons for they don't kill you, is a movie that have suspense because you want to know ho survey, in the movie someone love someone and protect each others, is very cute but on the 3 movies they are bad moments with the family, capitals, Friends, etc. in modern day there is very little public transpotr are used,ganeral public prefer much faster and conveninece  ways of traveling  around.though the pulic transport are used in mager citys to avoied traffic conjustion,it is wlidly reconizge that public transport are eco friendly. But lot of peoples saying that, the zoo can protected endagered spices against illegal poachers. I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked.Pleasure to work at concerts is when  I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate.The experience  is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert. You can learn just about anything on the internet, and most of it is absolutely free. Frist of all at home we recycle plastics, glasses, papers and cartons, oils, clothes, batteries, organics in an especial composting bank where we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials and finally all the other things are sends to an especial tip where we avoid to drop it anywhere. Contrary to the counter-arguments belief, a computer can actually aid in our social life. Secondly, do more cooperation between countries.To illustrate, people should cooperation To intervene to bring peace to the world to stop the war in many areas like what United Nations doing.For example, United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy . about my rest of family , as I said before they are just a relatives , but even if they are not friends almost ,but I do love them to much ,first one is my aunt ,the dead one ,and the other who still alive ,but i don't feel that felling of love towards my uncle , I do love him ,but he is just my uncle no more .

169	Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There are a lot of controversial idea between study alone and with a group of students. Three words that describe me really good is: happy funny and sometimes bothersome A thing that i would like that people knew is that its not a good idea that wake me when im sleeping. The future of public transport in developed countries is very different, because most people have a car, in   the people who live in poor countries, most people take public transport, because people doesn´t have a car and is cheaper take public transport, the pollution of public transport is huge and is growing third world countries should have, eco friendly transport. But in my case, I used to prefer studying with a group of students. I think study with a group of students is very efficient for learning something in following three reasons. In my opinion, Family is the place that had you best friend can help each other and know each.In the Taiwan,many of people have to take care of them parent when they get old,but the point is what if you can not survival,I mean you don't have enough money to raise you parent.Back to the topic,I don't know well any of member of in my family,I don't trust them,honestly. When I study, I often conflict to some part that I can not understand easily. If there is any friends who study same part with me, we can share our idea. If you are living in big town or small It does matter but one thing should be taking care by the people and organiser of the town, is environment.Global warming  is huge issue in today's date. In same way, I can help other members. So, it is easy to learn a knowledge in study with a group of students. But i was so mad at him and so ansiouns to make his life imposible, and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the sufering i had been throug became stronger and bigger, i had made a desition i was goingo to do it, if he dedicated 4 years of his life tourtoring me and not wanting me to be happy i would the time is nesesary for him to have a miserable life and i wont stop until i had acomplished my goald It means that studying with a group of student contains a process of crosschecking misunderstood concepts. The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years In my opinion ,Volleyball must then be considered among high-risk sports according to the frequency and gravity of our surgical findings.my advice for who starts this sport you will get fresh after you play this game and makes you doing your work in relaxetion way . I was wonder about the space of company. The reason was that there are a lot of sharing space rather than conventional company building. A few minutes ago,some boy who looks  like elderly than my old brother closed to the poor little boy,the little boy stopped cried,he looked on some boy,my brother felt afraid because they look like rube,but he still  wanted help the little boy. The purpose of that is to make more event of sharing idea between members. They said a lot of creative idea is triggered in communicate with others. Negaticvs about the online lerning are dat your not listening to much from ea real person and more from a Computer, if you dont have any listening things in the app you dont lern how to pronounce the words. I also realize that I can make creative idea in studying with a group of students. As we are fully depending on the indivitual generators ,that are causing multiple problems in he weather dueto it's smoke, the oil and gass left behind , in addition to sound offcourse that are themain source for the 18 countinous hours noise. So they make a plan to display all... The next day when they were about to start filming they ere non ants there so they search for them, but they can't find them... In that moment the ants and Penny attack them in their backs, making them to leave the place. Like this cases, we can make creative idea by studying with a group of students. Elizabeth apparent to be a very sweet girl, but Jason is not convince, because when he kiss her, he doesn’t feel nothing, he doesn’t feel that gravity disappear, and when his face turn red, he just put a face of horror and surprise , like if she was very sorry about kissing him. In conclusion the public transport is very good and if it desapear it will be a big problem, is right that some times you need a private transport but apart from that the public transport is very use by people of all ages. Yes,I think it also can educate.As times go by,technology is rapidly improving.More and more gadgets are invented such as televisions,smartphones and so on.There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly.Using will not only gain the entertainment but also get the knowledge.For instance,there are numerous program that we can choose.It is a good time to turn to the entertaining program,when we feel bored and gaze the wall all the day.Television provides educated varieties of channels as well.Discovery channel is posture-oriented model example to educate.We can learn how do the different animals feed on themselves.Above the statements can ensure a rich and abundant live. in a car accident , when she her what happened with her brother she was so nervous then the miracle happened she found a big suitcase in the train she decided to open the bag because no one was in the train so she opened the bag she surprised when she saw  a lot of money inside the bag  . The service is very bad the drivers are very angry and stressed out these do not lead with cauition, in Toluca exist report of high rates of accidents by buses. I like a car as well,but when I have to driving a car I have to think about parking a lot and I can't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am having travel,so the public transport is making connection with human beings.It is why I think public transport is really important for public and there are a lot of important thing is having a possble in the future. think has a future that all people use public transport then I think that maybe continue to have future but has bad and good things , for example good is easier to move in the city and you save time, and the bad , bad people attack you and steal things, but I thing ,that have future ,because a lot people even they use public transport to. as a result of this consumer gets more benefit like lower faire, privacy, freedom and safe travelling.in addition many automobile company launcing new car with affordable price which insiost people to use more and more private vechile. If we study with group of student, we use a lot of senses. Our brain easy to memory the content with our used sense. For example, if you explain something to your friends, our brain can memory much more that just reading same content. In addition, my major is English so teachers will teach and explain by English, which I can’t catch up on lessons well in the first time. We can collaborate with others, make creative idea and easily memory something by studying with a group of students. Why not study with your friends? The reason is the next, three days ago, he was working when a girl of his job asked him whether he had girlfriend and he told, I had one, come on you know my ex-girlfriend then she only walked without tell nothing. It can be a new paradigm to efficient, creative, easy study."	1.5

"Another example of why lives are gonna changed completely in 50 years is because also that connection between others cultures make People concern more about her own health, the expectations of life and the way they want to live it, because everyday will be easier to see how much are we hearting the earth so we will see faster the impacts that this brings to our life.

However, some might say it is better to study alone because leaving oneself alone can make people concentrate more on their work. Actually, that argument is not correct. However, I think the tools should be improved, such as killer’s knife and actors'costumes, the knife looks like as brittle as a handicraft, I believe those are seconded-handed clothing. No all is good some people haven't got money can't go to another place to another place and the pollution became more and more, it is a serious problem and the solution is only for the rich people, the solution is buy an electric car, the other solution, more economic, is the government give the money to the population to buy an electric car. It could be somehow true, unless you are ready to be willing to study. When you have rigid will to succeed today's work, leaving your friends beside you does totally not matter. Even, it could be helpful because your friend can be a audience who watches you studying. By having a watcher, you feel uncomfortable to take relaxed time. Here are some tips about the Egyptian people  they are so kind ,friendly,stressed but have a lot of  problems now days the level of poverty, standard of level ,the fixed cost  is increasing dramatically and the purchasing power is decreasing. At first and important change is about eating prepared food that isn't healthy usually,its reason probably woman's life stile that is going to big change in the way that they don't like staying at home and spend their time to making food ,now they prefer to buy prepared good. so, on my opinion, even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers Some argue that too much competition can result in destructive outcome. The other matter is about our habit to eating food together with our family that were a custom in humanity life not just in our culture,but now because of hard and busy life ,we had to eat our meal  mostly days of a week. Getting out of boring circumstance and encounter positive stimulator, exactly your friends, can refresh your mind and 
  Moreover, if you study with your group, you can share your questions and informations with your members. And the strengths and weaknesses in both of segmental and suprasegmental, I think it’s maybe the learning habit, when I heard a sentences, I would use many varieties of tone and manner to say the sentences again, therefore,I can easily be interpreted illustrations instructions the emotions and feelings. By teaching your friends what you know well, you can reorganized the information and stack them more firmly in your brain. Plus, by recieving answers what you don't know well, you can obtain the unknown knowledge so easily. This property of group study is the point many lecturers and instructors are focusing on, which make them try to increase the disscussion part in their classes. To sum up, group study can make people concentrate more on their work, cause positive competition, and communicate each other to get some information easily. But, they are the general advantages of group work, so you should not follow them without no consideration. Find your personality to studying, and not be stressful due to your uncomfortable study condition. I hope this writing can give you a chance to consider studying with other people."	1.5

"Hello, I decided to write in to the paper on the topic of computers, and how they benefit society. So, lets start, Most of the Metro cities are now days attract people of city towards Metro only not just because of the fare but because of the time that it saves. They benefit people in many ways, like they are very useful in buissness, helpful in education, and connect friends and family together. Computers are uselful in buissness and are an extremely important tool in a common workplace today, and make work get done much more efficiently than if they didn't have computers.

They can also be used for sending important information quickly and without much trouble. Currently we have got more than six different types of banks in our streets but as far as I know it is not sufficient to meet the needs of the environment because nowadays we do produce a lot of different materials, all of them overproduced and we do only learn this education in our home in our childhood, accordingly I am one of the few worried teenagers in the world about it so I really do help the environments as far as I can. Computers are important today's schools and educational programs becasue they can help students work in a more efficient fashion. ""@PERCENT1 of all surveyed students said they would rather type a paper for school than write on by hand, and shows that they value them in their education."" said @PERSON2, a professor at @ORGANIZATION1.

There are multiple ways that they could use their computers to keep in touch, like instant messaging systems mentioned before. Being able to communicate with one another makes theses people happy, and benefits society. Overall, being able to communicate through computers is an enjoyable thing for many people, and is important to society today. To conclude, computers contribute to society in ways that make it much better for everyone. Whether it's through helping buissnesses being more efficient, giving students the ability to work faster, and in a way they prefer, or if it's helping people stay in touch, computers are always benefiting society. basketball needs that the person should be tall enough to play it .i like basketball because it makes me happy,fit,have self_confidence and makes me active .if anyone want to play basketball ,he should do many exercises and try to be able to play it because everything is difficult at first but we shouldn't give up ."	1.5
172	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"It is well known fact, that millions of people die every year from lung cancer as a result of smoking. So, many countries prohibit smoking in public places. However, some people think it disturb their individual freedom and selection. To my mind, smoking in public places, especially in restaurants and cafes must be banned. However, I think the tools should be improved, such as killer’s knife and actors'costumes, the knife looks like as brittle as a handicraft, I believe those are seconded-handed clothing. !hhhh sometimes is funny but my husband he takes cars of me he doesn't allow to anyone to be much closer with me, my mother in law she likes swimming too  last night we went to the swimming pool it was a little bit cold but we liked so we went to the pool and srated to swimming i know how to swim very well but she doesn't she has to have a support otherwise she cant. Other reason for my opinión is that almost all the people preffer use the visual sense and ear to other person more than write and listen for understand new things. As well, we have to promote that the people get jobs close their accommodation or get the accommodation close to the jobs, because we have too much pollution and we could reward the companies that hire staff close to the place of job, maybe in a circle of 4 kilometres, as well we could reward the people that turn their accommodation for live near to the job or for going  there by a bicycle. For example, when pregnant woman is smoking, she should understand that her unborned baby in the womb is smoking also. Moreover, his life can be at risk. Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real. To begin with,the format of the bank notes needs to be designed,factors of considerations including the background colour,the artwork and the security issues.Sencondly,equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps.Thirdly,print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink,where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes. In the other hand, we live in democratic world and everyone has the right to do want he wants and this is a freedom. In old times luxuries were not considered as compare to Heslth but now every one prefer to save time and maintain privacy which one can only afford by using her/his private transport so gradually public transport losing its charm. my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long. This attitude reduced enromous amount of smoke pollution from the pipes.Government policy changes help a lot for water preservation.Many factories follwing the regulations and not draining the harmful wastage in the water. This perspective of life is inspired by contracultural movements and some people call to these people as “alternative”, but it is each day more common and it let a inclusive and diverse society. Most importantly,manually inspected on each printed sheet in case that there would exist damaged sheets.Once damaged sheets are discovered, partically separate them into good and bad ones and them burn the bad notes,making sure that the remaining sheets are of good quality ."	1.5

Firstly, the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel.Secondly, the public vehicle route are more far than usual route.Thirdly,it is also crowded and no privacy.Finally,there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker.

That I want to say, is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb's in Spanish Languaje, just Imaging you the same but not in your native lenguaje. They do so not because it saves them time, but because certain explicit topics - to an extent - can help someone mature if it's done in a controlled environment. Years ago, it was not uncommon to see censorship in the media. It could range from saying 'intercourse' to replace 'sex' or it could be something like extreme propoganda. There's a reason that our consitution protects freedom of speech. Them they drink a cafe that give them many energy to construct faster the building, this café has a combination for the people can to live all the night. The film is a romantic movie, It is talking about one man, Noa, who lives in a small shore town when he felt in love with a rich girl, but like always the girl´s parents did not like Noa´s life because the girl´s father thinks that Noa is not enough good for their daughter. Choosing what is and isn't offensive is a matter of opinion. As previously stated, no two humans are exactly the same, and their opinions won't be either. So this means that if one person out of a group is allowed to dispose of or censor whatever they find necessary, it must be recognized that some portion of the remaining people will be unsatisfied. This is usually where people will claim that the law protects their freedom of speech. In the end, the media is largely for entertainment. One day I visit my friend Jimmy in New York city, he was a young man who was specialist on trains and tourism, he talked about how the citizens and the commuters move from one place to another, he told me that the grand central terminal was the largest terminal of the city,he show me were the landmarks of the big apple were so sightseers could go,he show me the city and we went to different parts first he took me to Columbus circle in the south west corner of central park were there were the most expensive apartments then we went to the lake were the jogging tracks that circle the lake area popular with early morning visitors,then we went to the museum of natural history that was located near the metropolitan museum of art then I got focal on the subway trains so we went to Grand central terminal when we arrive I was amazed to see many people going to work so he told me that it was conveniently for people to use the train because is very fastest and for the government it was a grat economic business then he told me that one of the characteristics of This goes to show that if one should find something offensive, it doesn't mean they have to rip it off the shelves and complain; it simply means they have the opportunity look elsewhere"	1.5

If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that arguement  trying to protect that work from be taken away. It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. Michael went into the teacher office,but he found that his teacher isn't here,maybe teacher went to the bathroom,suddenly,the door is opened by teacher,a teacher who wore bikini came into sight,this incident came as quite a surprise to Michael,she flirted with Michael,Michael felt excited but run out of the office,but he had regret for his action,Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young. It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read. If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned. Another good option is give them a difficult work for every day keep them busy, but I don't know what kind of job can be, because a person who commit a crime isn´t going to do something to help society like communitarian service. A great mental image of serenity and peace. How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves?

If the  print sheets has good quality ,they will packing and distribution.some partially damaged  will cut into separate or packede or dispatched .The bad sheets will disposal ,the destroyed will be secure. MOTASSEM is a tall guy about 175 c.m and his Weight is 71 k.g and  has a wight skin  .He love going to the beach and he love swimming .He is a casual clothes wearing such Shirt and jeans which mostly  blue,Gray and Black .If you see him you notice how he is an elegant . Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to. I notice that in supermarkets are using so much plastic just to cover a small thing or are using many plastic bags without even think how vulnerable is for the environment. History has given the world many a cruel dictator. Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms. To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights. while we are spendind good time watching TV our brain is not in calm, only in an other position different to that ones in the rest od the day.That's why I think that it's a good momento to see the thing through a new glass and that can be a very high opportunity. If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes. I reduce use of innecesary power at home, in other words,I turn on light that I need for the while i use it;I take less warm shower; I hit only neccesary rooms. Now imagine that censorship occuring in a country that has civil rights. People would not stand for it. So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom? There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing. Some people say that basket it's only for tall guys but it isn't true, in the A league in Italy we have different players not very tall like 1 meter and 60 , so if you love this game you can play it no matter what find only a ball and a hoop and play it. first we uses Internet to discover the world's news, from Internet we can check and read world's most famous newspaper such as new York times, the sun and also electronic newspaper.Internet also can be used to learn and to educate yourself, internet allow us to read books, magazines and short stories.Internet is the most effective way to start a business and to look for a job, many people uses Internet to work , and they earning money every month.Internet is a way to make new friends all over the world through social websites such as Facebook,twitter, and you tube.As a conclusion internet is making things better and easier, life now is always connected to the Internet. But why public transport have no future to stand and keep going?, that's because of the people that changing their mind, they start like having their own way to travel, Privacy also an important reason, people need to have a private means of transportation. So if you want to work in Egypt you must have a complete information about the job (location ,salary,incentives, Allowances , work environment,position titles , company type,policy ,mission,vision)                                                                                               With best Wishes                                                                                                Sameh Sabbagh I think my town really take care of the environment,because there are a lot of parkｓ in this town and these are very clean.However　some people are not care of environment　that mean some people throw garbage away in the park.I think almost everyone loves parks because a lot of people go to the park and having　lunch,picnic,excersise,nap etc.I think after eat something at the park then clean themselves is good. Meanwhile, different countries have different rules.For example,people always walk on the right of the road in China .However ,Australian’s rule specify citizen drive on the left of the road.Secondly,loneliness would be a big problem when a person who leave their own country getting away from family members and close friends.Thirdly, students can’t be accustomed to western eating habits like burgers,pizza and bread .According to the unfamiliar environment students may lack the sense of security.There will evaluate viable solutions to the problem.The most important way is that individuals should participate in student activities which held by the students from the same nationality so that they may not feel lonely .At the same time they can also actively communicate with local students to acquire more information  about  Australia culture  in order to suit quickly. There is not so much traffic, and my senses and lounges perceive and respire all the smell that flowers,  land, the First, I walk slowly and then I begin to walk as soon as possible to improve my fitness and I end walking 5 turns in the park. Third, this is the most important step that printed sheets manually inspected,the this sheets are classified three areas.The number one called good quality sheets,they will be packed and dispatched.The next called partially damaged shees,and bank notes separaed into good and bad, good sheets will be cutted into separate bank notes and packed,the bad one will be destroyed by fair.The number three called bad sheets ,they will be securely destroyed. Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children. It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon. The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people. all my class called me creep ugly geek but still little good only when a teacher want from them a research or the exams are next couple days but Michael trying to stop me doing that because they never become my friends and i was bigger to do this things ;    that day i just finish help younger student to understand his  math lesson  My friend Michael asked me to do the same to give her answer sheet for all final exams i was in bi shook why she  want that from me  any way i collect my courage told her that was wrong and become to do that in college better to start study  now and I'll help her to study the hard lessons (i was very sad to say no & she asked me that)she become very angry and told me i should help her because we she was my best Friend then i told her that why i told her NO and she told me i hate you Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy. We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben, which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye.To got to the Big Ben we took the underground, but to get to the London Eye a red bus.After 3 days we went home.I forgot to tell you something about homeless people.A lot of people are homeless, which is sad, but maybe we can change it."	1.5

Obesity and other thins about help, is a topic very important because the people is dying for this problem.For example, the form to prepare the food, is gonna be dangerous because a lot food have artificial thing that is no good for us. However, this should not be seen as a problem. For one, the show played on television may enlight us and give us some enlightenment.Teleplay are not just for fun,it can have a deep meaning,short story tells big deal,just like a useful book.So,why not television cannot educate us? !hhhh sometimes is funny but my husband he takes cars of me he doesn't allow to anyone to be much closer with me, my mother in law she likes swimming too  last night we went to the swimming pool it was a little bit cold but we liked so we went to the pool and srated to swimming i know how to swim very well but she doesn't she has to have a support otherwise she cant. Nowadays public transportation is included almost all around the planet, We can admit that the transport revolution has been plave  in the last century but due to the globalization and technological development, the transport sector is always in a continuos transformation: In the other hand we must remarque how the plane sector has been grown, currently is the most common way of transport for going away and that's also means than the shipping factory has decreaced deeply, in order to let the plane market blomm. This helicopter had humid then the helicopter star to rotate in all the island then the helicopter go sinking in the water then the hurricane finished  the engineers start to distribute the food and medicine. Maybe, but when you're with the friends, you could save time to waste. For example, when studying alone, there is no one watching, so you keep looking at your cell phone. My studies in tecnologico de Monterrey are demanding and challenging because it has a very high educative score all worldwide, but also has to many good things, for example we have a lot of interchanges all around the world, when you have the opportunity to do an interchange you have to deal with the language and the culture with the other country, that means you have to be responsible for studying the basics things of that country, but all of this is worthwhile because when you are there you have so much fun. There is an advantage when you study with a group of students. It is easy to solve your curiosity  if you study together. When you are alone, you can solve the problem through only the internet. Or, you have to ask someone else later, so it's hard to solve the curiosity right away. However, you can have a discussion about the problem when you study with your friends. Also, there might be a student who has the same question as you. Suddenly,a rube boy grabbed the little boy 's clothes,the little boy was cried loudly,my brother was outrege,ran to the rube boy and attached  him.

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear The @CAPS1 newspaper, @CAPS2 in front of a @CAPS3 @CAPS1 after @CAPS1. This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. I believe that advances in technology have had a negative affect on people. we all know that do sport is very important to keep our life healthy and happy.My favourite sport actually is walking;and I prefer walking in the morning and before sundown.I like also walking in public street,gardens,clubs and on the shore.when i want to go anywhere;I do my best to go on foot.I like this sport since my childhood because I found that I can think about my good time when I was child and relax with myself to think carefully about my present and future.The walking can also fitness and do the knee stronger.It would be interesting to accompain your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time.I advice my guys who suffer from laziness and overweight,try to walk one hour at least and after that they will like this sport. Exercising means getting your hear to pound, your body to sweat and me because of endorprimes that ultimately make you feel better. @CAPS2 in front of a @CAPS3 all @CAPS1 does not support you with the natural urge to exercise. Ferrari making one of the fastes cars on the word, but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac, how they were in the past.If sameone like cars then should go to Formula 1 race to hear the bolid engine sound, I think that is the best voice which I have ever heard in my life.Formula 1 it is also  dangerous sport, the driver are exposed to the risk of  accident at high speed. so, i`m rely thinking left this sport.Everyday i get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends.i`m exercising more and more again to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world.i`m champion in my sport so, i`m seek to do all my effort to be the first one in the world.finally I did not find encourage of my family or my teachers. be goes on to say, ""many links have been theorized to this on going problem, But none seem to up as well as my theory.

There are many healthier things you can absorp yourself in. Although healthy diet is quite expensive young people follow special diet in order to have better body shape or healthy life.Actually modern life affected on our palate changing .Instance some people who work majority of their waking houres prefer to use fast food more.Our commitments imposes us to forget ourselves and our healthy . So my idea is aii the coutries allthe people stop to use farmland,forest andwetlang to build houses grow more trees portect our world,our homestar! Most illiterate people choose their proficiency as  public  transportations like ,bus service, cab service, auto service....etc, in order to full fill their basic needs.People with more  unemployment may also lead to a crime rate . Statistics show that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people say tennis have actually made them more confident. This is because when people are able to have the determination to lose weight and head healthier , they feel they can can over the world. My advice of finding work, is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work.But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase. Micheal was afraid he was waiting for sara to get out he went to the shore to look if she went from the other side but he found no footprints.his mother called him he went home and still thinking about sarah.it was night and ge was afraid ti get there again.he went to sleep .michael closed the door and knew at this moment he had made a mistake.

Online Lerning Positiv things about the online lernign are dat you are more mobile with your smartphone and you dont have to carry so much paper with you, also your on your own and in your own lerning speed what makes it more spesific on the user it selfs. This is terrible, you do not have privacy authought the society have a blame, because if they do not take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored. Her mom tried to tell Fernanda that they arrived very late because they had a very perplexed problem, so her mom told her that they came out from the park at 9:00pm it was still late but not too late, so they were on the street and the police arrived because they police thought that she had a globe with wine, and her mother told the police that she doesn't have alcohol or wine on her car, and they police didn't believed her and they took them to the police station so they could check his car, and about 10 minutes approximately they told her that she didn't have nothing so they, went from there to their house and it was late, so that’s the reason. In old times luxuries were not considered as compare to Heslth but now every one prefer to save time and maintain privacy which one can only afford by using her/his private transport so gradually public transport losing its charm. But, advances in technology also ruin this time belance of nature. Technology needs a power source, google, for example states to the press that,"" our business surely enjoys nature but needs to also run their corporation"". The picture below illustrates how to make bank notes.First is to design the note,including background color,artwork and security issues.Second is to prepare mental plates as well as qulified machinists.Then is printing with special ink.When the one side is printed,raising the images slightly to make opposite to be colored.Last is the key step,inspection.It is of importance to inspect the printed sheets.If the sheet is good or partialy damaged,it can be packed and delivered by veichals after cutted in to separate notes.Otherwise ,the sheets and notes would be abandoned and destroyed in the fire. ""we get our energy from oil and coal"" @CAPS5 according, to scientists like boy say that , oil primary source for big corporations.

Transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible In this view, I consider, though, there is lots of sports on Televison, they are not too much, because the people have looke for it. For example, the planetarium in a navigate room for learnt about the position of star, four small boats use for practiced the leadership and navigation in Pontevedra  river, or even the simulation for maked the situations which are seldom happen.

As we know public transportation has not a direct way to fulfill our all destinations then it force us to stop in many stations first, moreover we should take the other one to reach our destination so it is already obvious why using a car is better.

As @CAPS14 loosened up, they began to joke, sometimes in @CAPS4, sometimes in @CAPS5. Some of the @CAPS2 teased me about @CAPS16 accent. It wasn't a mean teasing; they weren't trying to be malicious, just light and funny. In conclusion, we are assisting to a new tend in transport, every time, they are faster and more developer, with the latest technology included but at the oppossite case, we find also a contradiction, as we found an other trend for the tradictional transport which avoid the pollution in order to respect the Earth In modern life,we rely on traffic to work or travel to everywhere.It is conveninet to travel by private cars .The price of private cars which every one can afford it,so that everyone has the private car nowadays .Some people point out private cars are going to replace the public transport . I was less a foreigner and more a new friend. so it become a fashion of using personal vehicle which create a lot of problem big one traffic problem..... now traffic problem is the biggest problem."	2
178	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Imagine that you are having a romantic dinner with your spouse, at a restaurant with nice ambience and the tempting aroma of food, when all of a sudden you smell a whiff of pungent cigarette smoke from the table next to you. The One of the most amazing thing that attractive you, is that it has  safari  which is more enjoyable thing ,at the sometime,it is introducing you to a wildlife  without needs to go out from your city. For me, it most definitely will, and thus I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants, for two main reasons. Firstly, second-hand cigarette smoke has been found to be extremely harmful, even more harmful to innocent passers-by than the smokers themselves. Even though do not everyone doing that,so how much public office is care of environment is important and this town is care of that a lot.Every morning some peasons are coming park and cleaned that makes feel really thanksgratitude. If the public transport will be by higher quality, faster and fewer rates, majority of citizens will be prefer: is more calm to relax and read a newpaper or a magazine during the way in a collective transport than an indiivdual one; moreover, the time spend up to go and came back will be reduced, because it promotes less car in the railway. we will know today some of information about Islam , Islam is great religion come from The Arabian Peninsula and its founded since 1436 years ago. Secondly, smoking does not fit in well with the ambience that restaurants aim to provide their patrons. This town is located in the central zone of the Afghanistan with 4462(km²) space, and has more than seven Million populations, the economic and security situation is not suitable and these factors have directly effect in to the carefulness of environment. Some people say that basket it's only for tall guys but it isn't true, in the A league in Italy we have different players not very tall like 1 meter and 60 , so if you love this game you can play it no matter what find only a ball and a hoop and play it. Thus, for the sake of their business, smoking should be banned so as to preserve their image. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants as it will benefit both the restaurant and the patrons"	2

As we already know, smoking is not good for our health. Too much smoking can inflicts acute diseases like cancer. In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that doesn't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used,so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground. Even though the smokers know the effects, many smokers can not stop smoking because of the addiction. when i ran with the ball, i feel that i hold a goal or a valuable something and i should offer my best to put it in his place and make it in right way  . One day many years ago in something place that a don't remember the name I woke up one morning more earlier than usual then I went to the kitchen and shout the name of my mother...but no one answered, and the first thing that I imagine is that they come to the town, quickly I went out to find they... But there was no one, absolutely no one, I'm scary, I yell and scream, look and look but I had no result  Suddenly I felt a warm hand that touched my shoulder and very slowly turn but the only thing I saw was a shadow that was holding a knife     I woke up and realised it had all been a bad dream Smoking bans in restaurants also important for the sake of non smokers. As we knows, many non smokers are feeling irritated because of smokes. so, on my opinion, even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers Researches have stated that passive smokers are affected more than the active smokers. I strongly believe that grammar is not the most important element to speak English, if you know grammar you only know certain rules to write, but I think that speaking is most important than writing, because when you go to anyplace in the world, you have to be prepared to talk and understand whatever they say to you; in this part you may notice that if you don't know vocabulary, you wouldn't unsderstand anything; but here is another topic, whether you understand or not, you have to notice the way that people talk to you, and try to realize what the person is trying to say. So I think it is essential to ban smoking in the restaurants. I think smoking should be banned on the public places. The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years It can help to reduce the number of smokers and bring ease to the non smokers."	2
180	"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"Laughter can change any situation. It can be used to break the awkward silence after a bad joke is told, to reminisce about a fond memory, or to clear ones head and create the feeling of calmness. In @DATE1 opinion laughter is a form of communication. public transport has a big role in transportation specially in large cities like Capital city of countries,  using the car some times causes traffic jam if all person uses their own car, to avoid this a good roadways is needed, also the cost of public transportation is lower than private transportation. Hi, Jenny Well, as you asked me Jenny, the most brilliant actor than see before is Vin Deasel, it is an excellent professional and he protagonized a great deal of movies like the saga of Fast and Furious, Ridic , Nannies bulletproof and other extras films. One of @DATE1 experiences with laughter has been with the many different exchange students that @DATE1 family has hosted. One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance,  homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society. Most of them have rather good broken @CAPS1, but there were some words that proved difficult to describe and translate. ""Annabelle"" is a horror movie which i am going to watch this Saturday.I am wondering if i will be scared after the movie.The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was closed in a museum from Conecticut where she is visited  by a preist  who blesses her twice a month.John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife :a beautifull colection doll dressed in a wedding dress.Unfortunatelly,in a horribble night the couple""s house was invided by a satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them.The satanists invoced an eavel entity that is capabale of the worst things...Annabelle.After Mia gives birth to her doughter Lilly,Annabelel wants to kill her.Even the preist doesn's know how to help the unhappy familly.Everyone is terryfied and find out that a demon is attached by the doll.Idon't know the end of the story but i don;t think that is a happy one... She lives in the northern part of the @LOCATION3, in the @LOCATION2 country. In the @LOCATION2 country they speak @CAPS2 and @LOCATION2 and culture is slightly different form the rest of @LOCATION3. What made @PERSON1 so enjoyable was her cheerful personality, her empathy, and her ability to make anyone in the room genuinely burst in to fits of laughter. I believe that this incredible ability of her's was one of the reasons that the summers I spend with her are some of @DATE1 happiest memories. @PERSON1 could turn any activity into a lighthearted experience. I would do tasks with her like washing the dishes, a chore I didn't usually enjoy, and the entire time we would guffaw at the most outrageous things. Together we would laugh until tears were streaming from our eyes and we felt the need to go to the bathroom. There are company so much,they make our life polluted.To take care of the environment,each of us has to do anything such as propaganda to the people in the country,...about my village, we use banana leaf stead of nilon, garbage desposal sensibly...and so on. Fortunately  Kabul structured  by Mountains and have mountainous climate, approximately this town  have 15 (mm) Raining per year the remarkable Agricultural area and forestry all around the town have a positive effect for the Kabul city environment and producing  Fresh air for the citizens of the mentioned town @CAPS4 she would say this we would look at each other and be back to rolling on the ground laughing. So, lets start, Most of the Metro cities are now days attract people of city towards Metro only not just because of the fare but because of the time that it saves. One day we went to the @LOCATION2 parliament building with our families, @PERSON1, her sister @CAPS5, @DATE1 sister @PERSON3, and I couldn't stop acting goofy and cracking up. But, in this moment the people think different, is to start to help the world and  Contamination is big problem for us and the planet. In my life,many dreams have existed in my mind,which is sweet ,incredible,magical or horrible.However,one of dreams is keeping in my heart that I can't forget it forever. I have heard many different facts about laughter; if you laugh before an exam you will do better on it, moments of laughter are more prominent in your memories, and a person that laughs daily is more likely to feel less stressed and have a happier @DATE1, but the reason that I love to laugh is that it makes me feel really fantastic."	2

She always tell me some jokes but some times i laughed !,i love her so much,i don't know how will my world being like without her and i won't to know . But, starting the summer semester, the way to login website has been changed. It is very difficult to deny the importance of family in our life,  definitely families play an essential role community structure .According to the experts we can't create  successful society without creative families , and one another specific part of your life is a good partners surrounding your daily activities. Type your KAIST ID. 2. Connect your KAIST ID and your smartphone using KAIST Auth application. First of all, thank you professor to teach in the meantime, the entire course of the learn really benefited, especially in the first meeting, for British English, I still did not really understand, it makes me frustrated, but gradually after I found the beautiful of the language in British English, I think it’s all because of the usual problem of American English, and so I really appreciate that you choose simple  textbooks and it’s easy to learn, and you really very carefully and very humorous, you're always careful in curriculum pronunciation correction for each student, using a variety of reading skills let us immerse them read. Everytime you try to login, you must certify twice using your smartphone KAIST Auth app in biological way(finger print or eye information) or OTP(one-time password)
 I always feel uncomfortable when I login KAIST website due to this way to login. n the town he tries that the people have to aware about the sitiations and they take care  the environment   On the other hand, the ask is if this solution could be enough or no. When I study something I usually turn off my smartphone because that makes me not focused. I am also committed to preparing monthly reports for newspaper supplement “The Voice of Women” which issued by the WATC “Women's Affairs Technical Committee , and I have the cooperation with the Environment and Development the magazine which issued by Center for development work ""Maan"", annd other web sites and news and media organizations. If I make a mistake to log off KLMS website by turning off the browser or something, I should turn on my smartphone to login again. Peter drove his car to the doctor's clinic and after half an hour he arrived and he and his grandmother go above through the stairs to reach the doctor's clinic after they arrived they found that they have to stay aperiod of time to take his turn they waited and then their turn came .they entered the doctor and the doctor was very kind he welcomed them and after check    peter's grandmother. Also, there is another problem. If I lost my smartphone or didn't bring it from somewhere, I cannot login to the KAIST website. Travelling by using any transport has become in one of our needs, in the past people used to take hours waiting for the public transport, now, we can afford any of those modern car at the agency. It is very important problem to university student, because without KLMS we cannot attend online-classes and that must affect badly to the grade. This situation haven't happened to me yet, but it is enough to occur. public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it is kind of becoming cheaper and also more safe but some  people prefer cars to extent do we agree with and what is our reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay  before about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was not even good facility to move from place to other and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans at the beginning the faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve it by the end nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and planes .some people prefer cars because the do like crowded places or because the find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places  to summaries it is different from some oneis opinion to another i predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end cars will disappear and will will no longer be used It is safe due to biological data or OTP. So that prevents someone else login to my account. The other chart is about employer support, under 26 years old is the most higterst because it almost have 70%, the scentd higterst is age 26-29 years old; it has 50% of people are taken; niy yhe most lower is 35% age of group are 30-39 years old. However, that way has these benefits but I think it is too uncomfortable everytime I login. In all over the world people always need advices to keep looking after their environments .First ,the municipal should do workshops in schools and universities providing students by tips that should help us to make our environment clean .Second ,they should make awareness campaigns about environment ;for example , telling people to put their rubbish in waste papre basket which helping workers to recycling it easily .Finally ,to stay healthy we need a healthy environment ."	2
182	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positieve effect on people. They do because you can talk to others online, it allows you to get research done faster and they are much more efficent and easy to use i will further explain my reasons. on the other hand, public transportation takes more time to get to the required station, because already public transport taking long path to go across more places and as more as peoples take benefits from it, and public transport usually crowed and do not be on time. Talking to others online can give you good communication skills and you can get to know different people. In case of transportation technology, in this twenty first century we have various option like Plan that can fly with the cloud, train that fast and big enough that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time. We talk to each other using webcams, instany messaging, or talking on a social site like facebook. My name is shousheng and live in Montreal Canada.Alrough Canada is an English country however in Montreal, the offical language is Freach. Next, computers allow you to get research done quicker. Studies shown that @PERCENT1 of people prefer using a computer to find information for any type of paper than an enclyepdia or other book. Computers are much more efficent and easier to use than books. We as a human who live in these days , we live rely on technolgy, every aspect of our live are supporting by technolgy. Three words that describe me really good is: happy funny and sometimes bothersome A thing that i would like that people knew is that its not a good idea that wake me when im sleeping. Finally, computers are more efficent and easy to use. other people prefer to travel by trains as it's faster and more comfortable than cars.Many countries like to travel by bikes in order to decrease the pollution which happened by car exhausted.to my point of view i prefer travelling by cars which is more comfortable. Computers are so much easier to use than books. On the comuter you just type in what you are looking for in search bar a boom within a tenth of a second your results are there. Already public transport have been improvement and that makes comfortable to go on a trip,but I think that will be able to become good quality more and more,because so many people expectation. It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. so, on my opinion, even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers More environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of themthere is to that we have a center of care and, other more institutions, we also make environmental protection centers were people can visit and learn about this to sum up our village is very concentrated on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us I hope you will agree with me and my thoughts about computers."	2
183	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"In the public transport you don't have your own sit so sometimes you travel standing which is not very comfortable and in winter you don't have air conditioning so if it's cold in the outside it's cold inside the transport to, sometimes you have to travel with sick people that can transmit you the illness. last summer i worked at cinema.i think it is a very good job because you can see any films you like for free.The minus of this work is very big salary and i think that i will work at this cinema on the next summer. He regret to enter KAIST. Because it is hard to live at KAIST if international students don't know Korean. However if this situation not change and if our government not take providence about this important subject will be the end of the transport public and will more convenient to use car. First, I want many people use English more in the communication sites such as Everytime, Otl. Most of students share informations by using only Korean in the communication sites. Firstly,design the bank notes' backgroud colour it is artwork security issues.Second preparation metal plates.It's skilled machinists.Then the sheets of bank notes printd .Printing colour on both sides and sprcial ink or images slightly raised. when am in the court other side participants are fear take off my service ball and am very at my position to cover the entire court. I can tell you that I fell I can understand over 90% when I'm listening and when I´m Reading, but my main problem with English is of course when I must speak: I fell my self horrible without confidence, I think that always I'm thinking in Epanish and after makind the translation to English, may be in this moment when I'm writing this composition I'm making the same wrong. I hope both international students and Korean students enjoy campus lives and communicate each other more."	2

These amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation. In fact, they have done quite the opposite.

The future for the public transport shouldn't be  taken lightly,  in my opinion, the public transport is the best option for ending the problems with the traffic jam because when we use a bus or subway , a lot of people is travelling from one place at other in only one transport or vehicle. They told her that her brother had a car accident first of all she shocked  Then she went quickly to the train station and she bought ticket to London when she was in the train she had other phone cell . Players have to look at an incoming ball, and guide their stick or mitt to catch the ball. As you can see, coordination is essential to sports. television serves the multipurpose of entertaining and educating people.in order to cope up the competiting world and get recognized in the corperative world one must strive hard,which in turn increases their stress levels.Television has become one of the means to reduce the stress levels.besides providing entertainment television has also become a source of information. For all the people I advise to start to play or watching football because for me it is a very good sport , but you can play a good football only if you really like it , because first football is fun . Nevertheless the journalists stay all the time having a photo,all the time,when they eaten, drinking, happy, sad,how is your love life and with whoever stay, if stay with something important our what buy. As we are fully depending on the indivitual generators ,that are causing multiple problems in he weather dueto it's smoke, the oil and gass left behind , in addition to sound offcourse that are themain source for the 18 countinous hours noise. n the town he tries that the people have to aware about the sitiations and they take care  the environment   On the other hand, the ask is if this solution could be enough or no. So they make a plan to display all... The next day when they were about to start filming they ere non ants there so they search for them, but they can't find them... In that moment the ants and Penny attack them in their backs, making them to leave the place. No matter how hard you try if you are using a computer, you will learn something. The internet is a best cache of information. In the current day and age, the environment is a growing concern. Most of the labours will probably have been represented by machinery, the people who is lack of academic might be very hard to get a job, the knowledge might be demand if the people live in the future. It takes forty years for a tree to grow, and seconds to cut one down. Online Lerning Positiv things about the online lernign are dat you are more mobile with your smartphone and you dont have to carry so much paper with you, also your on your own and in your own lerning speed what makes it more spesific on the user it selfs. I think that any one wants to start sport can play squach which  gives stretched  and  healthy body,in the same time this sport can be played for a long time of period without caring about the age. The average kid could learn more in an hour with a computer than they would whole day at school. We separated paper from glass and also to plastic.The garbage picks up paper once a week,plastic two times at month and undiferretiated three times a week to all people who live in my country.My district makes clean my village and it usually tries to make attractive with new social initiatives for the community. Computers are also a massive social network. Instant messaging and @CAPS2 are now primary sources of communication. If it hasn't for computers, I wouldn't be able to talk to my friend that moved to @LOCATION2 two years ago. This is just one example of how social networks are helpful. They help people stay connected with old friends, and work. All major corporations use computers to invest, sell products, and store information. Computers are the ultimate way communicate. This major involves all, always we have to consider the all possibilities to resolve  homework , you have to know the most possible information for can resolve it. The @LOCATION1 should put this to use. Imagine a more eco-friendly country where we don't have to cut down a million acres of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 rainforest every year. The benifits of computers are endless. Three of these are hand-eye coordination, knowledge and communication."	2
185	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"People grow up from diverse environment, and consequently they have different thoughts and idea about arguments. When I want studying for exams  going to the living room and sitting front of TV In addition, there is a small blackboard for my littel brother because my mother wants my prother learn Arabic and English letters. There might be some people who believe that the computers make their life more stressful. However, I personally believe that computers brought many benefits and play a very important role in our modern life. First of all, they do every task faster. Considering the fact that time is a valuable factor in everyone's life, when you give your computer a job you are sure that it will be done in a blink of an eye and it is not going to take much of your time. For instance, before the computers were invented, we had to do a large number of calculations by hand and not only did it take a lot of energy and effort but also it took a great amount of time to calculate what we needed. First,the bank notes are designed by consider,thinking from background colour,artwork,security issues.Then,the metal plates are preparated by skilled machinists.And then, the sheets are printed,operator should pay attention to the colour on both sides,special ink,and images slightly raised. Apart from that you see new places and you have fun, you also lern others cultures, historicals facts, you also lern to respect others peoples and thirs costums. This helicopter had humid then the helicopter star to rotate in all the island then the helicopter go sinking in the water then the hurricane finished  the engineers start to distribute the food and medicine. Another example of why lives are gonna changed completely in 50 years is because also that connection between others cultures make People concern more about her own health, the expectations of life and the way they want to live it, because everyday will be easier to see how much are we hearting the earth so we will see faster the impacts that this brings to our life. Second, they provide various sorts of entertainment for people especially for children. Computers include many video games for different age ranges and a variety of tastes. When I was in high school, I did not have a laptop for some financial reasons. My advice of finding work, is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work.But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase. n the town he tries that the people have to aware about the sitiations and they take care  the environment   On the other hand, the ask is if this solution could be enough or no. I start this sport since I was 10 years old.where my father was playing this sport also,but he started it when he was more greater than me,He was about 30 years old.where squash is one of the games that can be played in any age,I love this game because I find it making exercise to all the body in the same time , we are running in small place moving hands in stretched and different ways in the same time you are working your mind in the same time so it need caring and quik thinkink, as much exercise you will find down the road . This first reason is all actors shown their talent in this film directly and audience can follow their steps and the story certainly, this essential element which also makes a big success to the film. squash sport also can be played individually as two players together or in team of 4 players.squash one of the very nice attractive sports One of the example is television, in the past we use it only for watching news and movie, but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t, now television has others function. For this reasons, every company use computers everyday, and they can't do anything without computer's software programs. I can say that we can't live one day without computers. In some, even though some people may believe that computers have made life stressful and more complex, but I intensely think that the opposite is true. public transport is very crowded so you may not have a seat .I hate public transport as I was attacked by mad man once .also taxi is  not a good transport .I wish I have my own car soon to get rid of public transport . I advise every office and home to have at least one computer and make a good use of it in its most proper way."	2
186	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"I think smoking is really a bad habit to be having. And the strengths and weaknesses in both of segmental and suprasegmental, I think it’s maybe the learning habit, when I heard a sentences, I would use many varieties of tone and manner to say the sentences again, therefore,I can easily be interpreted illustrations instructions the emotions and feelings. She told me not good at all, but my was good and she also added that you may got the chance and finally I got it.After three days later our result has been published and I got the chance but the girl didn't. I really hope that they would stop smoking as it is really harmful to their bodies. On top of them, they are unknowingly hurting everyone around them by making them passive smokers, or polluting the air. We as a human who live in these days , we live rely on technolgy, every aspect of our live are supporting by technolgy. I told them to stop but till today, I am not truly sure if they have stopped smoking. I really wish that they did. It is true that we are a lot of users that want to use the car but, and that amount is  growing up; as well there are a lot of people that don't have the posibility to have a car and some use the public transportation because many reasons like the price, because it is easier to get to the place by public transportation rather than car, because the traffic, some times for people it is so exhausting to drive lots of hours an even some times the public transportation is faster. I sincerely hope that in the future, less and less people will be smoking cigarettes. My father used to be a smoker according to my mother when he was in his younger days. Hi, Jenny Well, as you asked me Jenny, the most brilliant actor than see before is Vin Deasel, it is an excellent professional and he protagonized a great deal of movies like the saga of Fast and Furious, Ridic , Nannies bulletproof and other extras films. yes, i agree, if you planed the travelling for a long distation and for a long time you would prefer to do it on car, couse firstly you;ll spend less time, you travelling will be comfortable, you'll have a possibility to stop every where and for a long time, as you need. ""If there is a will, there is a way"" as quoted, hence I feel that it is important for us to all to continually encourage our love ones to stop smoking."	2

She turned her haid and saw him ""he was fowling me"" she thought""well,I should ask him what are he doing here"" ""What are you doing here"" ask Alison he looks her but with a bad smile,and turn his head This process involves five main stages.First,it should take some considerations in design,including background colour,artwork,security issues.Next,skilled machinists is prepared ,in which there are metal plates.Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet).Subsequently, the technical must be used specially for distinction,for example the colour printed on both sides,Special ink is used and imges slightly raised.After this,printed sheets will be inspected carefully.According to the quality of sheets,it will be two results.if the quality is good or the bank notes is partially damaged which can be used,it would cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and disoatched.while those bad sheets will be securely destroyed. My sister lives in @LOCATION3, and as a result I barely get to see her or even talk to her. Then, when my mon bought me a laptop, we were able to speak to each other again. Nowadays the public transporte isn't hardly necessary for our life.However,a lot cities have a problem about traffic,cause of this trouble that citizen don't use public transporte such as autobus, taxi, or even metro.Consequently,gorvernment start to support and take care of the public transporte. Now, @CAPS4 a modern, civilized world. You, the parents, are heading to work while your child goes to @ORGANIZATION1 and enters into the wonderful learning center @ORGANIZATION1 computers. Sizdehbedar: It means Thirteenth day of spring , on this day people going picnic and spent the day out of  their homes on the nature because they believe that Thirteen number that brings bad luck for them . This attitude reduced enromous amount of smoke pollution from the pipes.Government policy changes help a lot for water preservation.Many factories follwing the regulations and not draining the harmful wastage in the water. They presnt jobs, educational opportunities and a way @ORGANIZATION1 communication! You do not have to use them all the tim, still enjoy nature and fun with friends dear readers, but do not forget computers! Computer usage will keep you in the @DATE1!"	2

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"IN my country peole do alot of mistake and have alot of of bad habits concerning their attitude towards the rubbish ,they are always throwing their old things and rubbish in public place ,the governement also cannot do their role towards their people and their bad behaviour That meaning is life. However the best option is that you came here and after I present my friends and their fathers because they can help with your job. Nowadays a person's worth seems to be judge  according to the social status and material possessions, that is mostly to happen in high class famiies, as they are foccus on achievements as power, political influences etc. There are some big shelves in center of market are divided to some different parts for kinds of goods like Dried fruit, nuts, flour, condiment, beans, grains, rice, etc. although traveling by car is really interesting but still using public transport has its advantages ,by using public transport you're saving  effort when  driving a car for along distance you will get tired , some people don't have enough money to buy their own car . This afirmation: travelling by car is so much more convenient say everything, for example if we think a lot of time we spent on wait bus to arrive our destiny, the traffic is a lot of things that everyone prefer  buy car it more practical and fast. You could argue that they can be used to detonate bombs, but, lets be practical, how many normal people actually wake upwake up and point out the drearyness of life and then type in a command to detonate a bomb? A serious benefit you have obviously choes t o overlook is the invaluable information it aptly places in front of you on a @NUM1 inch screen. Spent half an hour after we arrived, started coming everybody, there were many greetings, thanks, hugs, kisses, and then we all went to the table, which was magnificently structured, plenty of food of all kinds, drinks, but we were all waiting for the main course, also the food was magnificent, but the best part was when the couple went to the pool, we were lucky we had an amazing wedding planner who arranged the magnificent and fun activities, he said to the bride and groom enter each an inflatable ball and try walking on the water as long as withstand, and the bride won because the groom slipped and fell after them, out of the ball, fell into the water, and kissed. Further more, not everything that you speculate as bad has to be bad just because you say it so. When you think of @CAPS3. Do you always think about vulgar, inappropriate pictures, and illegal images? That’s funny, because @CAPS3 keeps family in touch, gives people things to do, and keeps friends in different states on the same server. Youtube is not all swearing and bad videos. Tottaly l think changing is ignorable but we can control it to make our life better,specially about food that is most important aspect of ourlife but we don't pay attention to it enough. Nevertheless travel by car is easier for commute for example, because they can choose a personal timetable without a terrible discomfort of buses; in addiction there is a fair chance that by the end of this century dwellers will stop travelling by public transport, in special way if the government have invested his money in green energy and we could discover a new green car, which in turn revolutionary our life. so it become a fashion of using personal vehicle which create a lot of problem big one traffic problem..... now traffic problem is the biggest problem. many countries are truly started to concern no environment and worried about the globe warming ,In schools teachers are doing their best  to educate children how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy,also they train them how to plant trees in public gardens of their towns ,Although  government strict so many laws and taxes in the people how do not pay their taxes to the council for cleaning of the rubbish from towns and villages,in the biggest polluted city in the world people started to use bicycles and cycling instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city,also they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive. You probably didn’t even know that, from a computer, astrologists monitor images of the universe captured by the hubble space carrier meteorologists track cloud formations from satellites using a computer. Maybe you didn’t choose to say that surgeons can dictate operations from their office in @LOCATION1 on a patient in @LOCATION2? You didn’t even say that seismologist use computers to traet the shifting of the tectonic plates to see where the epicenter of a major earthquake is? You just didn’t know. So, let’s face it, computers are important. You probably used to do what little research you did them. In fact, pardon me. MEASURES IN FAVOUR OF TAKING CARE THE ENVIRONMENT The council is carrying out a project in order to erradicate the rubbish in my town.This project is focused on separating the rubbish in each green points of the city and also they have to maintain their neighbourhood as clear as are possible. In addition, stress is a clear disadvantage of compete because competitiors are trying to win and this can frustrates.But, some people do not think this like this and take it more simply Finally, I think that to compete in sports has some benefits and disadvantages, but when is controlated there are some benefits that help you to whole you life."	2

"In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that doesn't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used,so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground. There are a few people are using puplic transport, like students and someone had low income.in my veiw, i can say might be the puplictransport going to e close because nobody is going to beclose Many people feel that the applications on a computer are @CAPS1 keeps us away from doing other productive activities, but the applications a computer holds is neccessary for must tasks. It is a time when children must choose, which people are good or bad, which way they will go to difficult situation for example they will be drink alcohol or they will have fun without any suplements. It allows you to do simple or complex math in just less than @NUM1 seconds. MOTASSEM is nice and lovely fiance he love his job as he is Patient will dong has jop .he is  a  hard worker he has amazing laughs     .When you started  talk with him you will be inspire by his knowledge and his way of talk he have the talent to Convinces  thought. Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe, in fact there is some important tournament where participate all important Europe team,They are called ""Champions League"" and ""Europa League"".football is a team sport in fact in this sport participate everyboby without exclude nobody. This application allows you to take notes by typing, which again eliminates the need to write with a pencil or a paper. Note taking on the computer can be used for easy to read notes to study from to get a good grade on an upcoming test or quiz. The most important and must commonly used application on a computer device is the internet. The internet has over millions of websites for many reasons. If you plan to go to the movies tonight, the internet will surely give you movie times, directions, and how long the movie will be. It is also a great way to plan family trip or to book flights and such. Considering this, the apps are very useful. In these diagrams below,the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly.The first step,the bank notes should be desinged concidering some constructions,like background color,artwork and security issues,After it was prepared,skilled machinists would make preparaation of metal plates in the second step.Then,sheets of bank notes would be printed by 50 bank notes per sheet,which have colour imagines on both sides in special ink.After printing well,these sheets would be manually inspected closely.It was the most important step during the whole processing.And then,some  sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets  which would be cut into and separated into equal ones andpacked and depatched to where they are demanded. Secondly, it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting a time in waiting a specific time to move or even waste a time in waiting a public transportation to reach all point it should get it , but in the other side when  you have your own transport or a private transport is get a right to choose time of trip or when you want to move or stay, and nowadays we cannot waste our time in taking public transport. It is also a great learning technique for research. However, I think the tools should be improved, such as killer’s knife and actors'costumes, the knife looks like as brittle as a handicraft, I believe those are seconded-handed clothing. We were all excited, those from Lala Band minunate.Their voices have positive vibration through their musical and give you a good feeling.On the scene moves very well and know how to take pleasure to the public.I am feeling wonderful and my promise is that when going to have a special occasion to go to a concert supported by Lala Band, you will be with me.As like this in all my heart.I hope as those recounted by me in this mail and you feel a slight vibration from the concert. The computer allowed me to find the garment both women and men wore, @CAPS1 material they were made from, and even now they managed to buy and get the material. In the public transport you don't have your own sit so sometimes you travel standing which is not very comfortable and in winter you don't have air conditioning so if it's cold in the outside it's cold inside the transport to, sometimes you have to travel with sick people that can transmit you the illness. If you ask someone about the future, answers will be different but all will be around two main topics, Those last are either optimist future or pessimist one. Then the engineers call to other sector to ensure the doubt of Atlantis then the professional say that other was correct. Email on a computer allows you to send messages to a single or multiple people whatout the need of signal or service. Blogging is also a way of communication on a computer and gives you freedom to express your feeling on education on a certain topic. The instant message is probably the must used by teens. one of the most amazing parts of the film is when Teresa calls Cruel for go for them and take them again to the Cruel building and like all of them doesn't wanna go with them they start a war and they take Mihno with them and at the end Thomas decide to go after them and he give a super great speech for all the persons go with them and help him to get back Mihno, and what i really want to see in the next film is that if Thomas is mad at Teresa( i never like her) and if they get free and the world comes back to the normal world. It allows you to quickly talk a person without waiting, for reply for more than days. In conclusion, the computer is essential to our everyday life and without the computer, our people would not function!"	2

"Dear @PERSON1, To this day, there are many people who use telecommunication devices, like the computer. Some think computers have a posotive effect on people. One day many years ago in something place that a don't remember the name I woke up one morning more earlier than usual then I went to the kitchen and shout the name of my mother...but no one answered, and the first thing that I imagine is that they come to the town, quickly I went out to find they... But there was no one, absolutely no one, I'm scary, I yell and scream, look and look but I had no result  Suddenly I felt a warm hand that touched my shoulder and very slowly turn but the only thing I saw was a shadow that was holding a knife     I woke up and realised it had all been a bad dream In the reconquest age the stronghold never downfall with a direct assault, finally the Castellan's army after a large siege force to the government surrender it. Although using a computer can become an addicting and unhealthy habbit, they teach a person everyday about something, are enjoyable, and help save the earth. Using computers is something I know millions of people use everyday, and would think @CAPS2 would be difficult to live without. In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life, but majority of ones is totally utopic. We each have our own specific reasons for using them. the most family member I love and think she is the best friend of mine , my sister , she is elder me about 12 years , I can tell her any thing about my life , my self , my feelings ,hhh also i think if i felt in love she would be the first to know that . On the one hand, there are alot of famous player on volleyball who had Knee ligament injuries ,The most frequent mechanism of injury was landing from a jump in the attack zone.In addition to this,Injuries were more frequent during games than training. So say when my mom is working, or me and my sister are researching something we learn. Before these were computers, everyone used, but now that we have the internet, theres no really need to get a book. The people of my town try to plant plants in the centre or somewhere is too smoke, so they try to keep the air at recommended levels.on the morning a lot of people go on footto the work or to the school or ride a bike or they take the bus.The people try to move the local factories out of country where is less air polluted ,less smoke,less cars and more forests and plants. Now this is an inconvenience to people, so why not use the internet thats quick, and. People also use computers to like I mentioned above with maybe facebook, @CAPS1, or e-mail. @CAPS2's quick, easy and fun. I am on third year at the university, I don't know what will be the master than I go to make, but I want a master relationed with programming. When I was returning from syleth I called the girl and talk to her and assure that I got chance in university but girl says that she knew it. now days young people are influence towards the western culture so,they are getting more fashionable.youngster are interested to wear different stylish and colored clothes.they are happy with wearing different color clothes.they didn't want to wear our cultural dress such as sari,dhoti,choli and many more.they only like to wear shirt,pant skirt,t shirt and many more.youngster are influence by watching different programmes on  television. The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years So many people use computers everyday, and @CAPS2's bad for your physical and mental health. Transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible Nowadays public transportation is included almost all around the planet, We can admit that the transport revolution has been plave  in the last century but due to the globalization and technological development, the transport sector is always in a continuos transformation: In the other hand we must remarque how the plane sector has been grown, currently is the most common way of transport for going away and that's also means than the shipping factory has decreaced deeply, in order to let the plane market blomm. They wasn't exercise which could be bad for their physical health. Also, staring at a screen all day is bad for your eyes, and brain. So I think, due to these causes, people shouldn't use them constantly. The television is one of the most important AV media in the world.You can use it for many purposes, according  to your needs .There are a lot of channels in many roles,for instance , education , movies, songs ,sports,news and so on .The television is not only for entertainment but also for education .The television can entertain you through it's entertained channels, and the television can educate you through it's educational channels. Thank you and I hope you agree with my statements."	2

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Ferrari making one of the fastes cars on the word, but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac, how they were in the past.If sameone like cars then should go to Formula 1 race to hear the bolid engine sound, I think that is the best voice which I have ever heard in my life.Formula 1 it is also  dangerous sport, the driver are exposed to the risk of  accident at high speed. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -that work I abhor -then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. When printing finished,they should inspection.It the most important step.Printed sheets manually inspected.Finally,they  found good quality sheets and some partially damaged sheeets or bad sheets.They will packaging and distribution the sheets which is good in there.In that time they at fist cut into separate bank notes ,second they packed the sheets and diapatched. @CAPS1 was quoted from an author named Katherine Paterson. I don't believe certain materials such as books should be removed from shelves under any circumstances. MOTASSEM is a tall guy about 175 c.m and his Weight is 71 k.g and  has a wight skin  .He love going to the beach and he love swimming .He is a casual clothes wearing such Shirt and jeans which mostly  blue,Gray and Black .If you see him you notice how he is an elegant . If books are removed from the shelves due to censorship, than what is the point of writing or even reading books? If people continue to remove books because they're found to be offensive, then there won't be any books left to read. It is true that we are a lot of users that want to use the car but, and that amount is  growing up; as well there are a lot of people that don't have the posibility to have a car and some use the public transportation because many reasons like the price, because it is easier to get to the place by public transportation rather than car, because the traffic, some times for people it is so exhausting to drive lots of hours an even some times the public transportation is faster. Whether it had something to do with religious beliefs or even revealing too much sexual content, I'm sure it's offensive to someone somewhere. Books are written by authors who believe they have the right to express themselves through writing. Three robots in specific hour make a show with instruments like a band.Foxy the pirate makes a show individually in her pirate cove, The children loves Foxy because plays with the kids making questions about the pirates and count a pirate story. @CAPS1 world is full of offensive and rather disturbing books. It can't be right to just get rid of those things because they bother us. Everyone has the right to read any book they want to. I am beleving that there is no future for the public transpot, using trains is mor convient and low expenses also to decrease the carpon gases which affecting the ozone, people should be aware about the effect of using the public transpotation on the econmics and enviroment, goverements shall encarge the people to use the other ways for transport, this subject shall be issuesd in all media to learn and encrage the people to use he wrigth way for transpot. i think that this is the guestion for every one, and the answer can't be one for all, cause, someone can use public transport, and economy by this not only money, but and the environment, but some people don't like to use p.t., cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple don't like to travell with another people. What gives anyone the right to remove or change something because it's inappropriate? no of all people could afford to make conveyenc by car .car is easy and cozy also but public transprt is fair is much affordable to all clasess of poeple public transport means mainly pubic bus.people used to travell long disistance by publis bus .it is possible to carry large number of people of different places to carry in bus. Perhaps, somebody else has been waiting to find that book. If I did remove it than I'm restricting others from experiencing the joys of reading that book. Censorship in general is wrong. However, they have some disadvantages with a public transport, they gave many traffic jam, this is because the bus a large and difficult to control . subsequently,this step is most important.bank note should be inspected.bank notes separated into good and bad if get good quality sheets,the next stage is packaging and distribution.at this stage sheets should be cut into separate bank notes,packed,and dispatched. Fortunately  Kabul structured  by Mountains and have mountainous climate, approximately this town  have 15 (mm) Raining per year the remarkable Agricultural area and forestry all around the town have a positive effect for the Kabul city environment and producing  Fresh air for the citizens of the mentioned town Just because you don't approve of it doesn't mean everybody doesn't approve. Authors write books for a reason, musicians write music for a reason, people make movies and magazines for a reason. now days, there are many type of transport in the world ,bus taxi,train but train more conform then else , I always used bus in city. My favorite sport is swimming.I engaged in swimming in nine years old.I had gotten first prize in a match.As a result,I think that I have some intellent on swimming.Since then,I meet my teacher in the pool.She teach me a lot of things,and be the most important figure in my life.She is a doctor,she told me that swimming will let my body more better.From then on,I fell my disease in decreasind and fell relax.Consequently,I need to swim usually. When I was young , I enjoyed playing basketball.I thought that it's the best sport ever.It made me fit and strong.It taught me the meanings of teamwork and leadership.I Kept playing basketball 4 years continuously till I joined the secondary school.My advice to anyone starting basketball is to never giving up and always keep playing till the last minute. If you don't like a book because it offends you, than don't read it. Firstly,the city of Vancouver has a programme called go green Vancouver that it will protect the environment selecting the rubbish by containers at the same time there is a collaboration from the city hall of any district that it will provided a 3 containers for each house one for papers one for bottles y the last one for rubbish materials.

"By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we don't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars don't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport. They can help you learn about subjects of places you think are interesting you don't know about. They can help save the environment. But, on the other hand, because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable; cars are so many; very noisy, unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth. First, they can help you learn about new subjects. Say you are doing a report for school on the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 of the @CAPS2, but you didn't know any thing about them. You could just go sit at your computer, enter ""@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 of the @CAPS2"" in a google search, and press enter. There you here hundreds even thousands of entries about the @ORGANIZATION1. Fifty minutes passed ,when my body no longer was sore.I decided to walk to the end.Constantly,I just walked like without terminal contest.While I strugged to walk.Finally,I saw a light to appeare my eyes and I woke up. In the reconquest age the stronghold never downfall with a direct assault, finally the Castellan's army after a large siege force to the government surrender it. You could even learn about a computer and all of its history! However we the people have really important part of making it worse.Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh, clean and safe environment to their people.Recycling item can be a good step to start with clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking care by my city.Everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of province government.People is not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere. People are always using paper and paper comes from trees. When we cut down trees we are harming our environment. Elizabeth apparent to be a very sweet girl, but Jason is not convince, because when he kiss her, he doesn’t feel nothing, he doesn’t feel that gravity disappear, and when his face turn red, he just put a face of horror and surprise , like if she was very sorry about kissing him. If everybody used computers, we would be using less paper. We could use to send documents and papers, we could bring to tax appointments and pair suits. Computers could even be used for school work. The teacher could asign the homework email it to the student the student could fill it out and email it back. Sure we would still have to use paper for somethings, but we would be using in way less. Firstly,the city of Vancouver has a programme called go green Vancouver that it will protect the environment selecting the rubbish by containers at the same time there is a collaboration from the city hall of any district that it will provided a 3 containers for each house one for papers one for bottles y the last one for rubbish materials. n the town he tries that the people have to aware about the sitiations and they take care  the environment   On the other hand, the ask is if this solution could be enough or no. Thirdly, computers could help us advance into the. IN my country peole do alot of mistake and have alot of of bad habits concerning their attitude towards the rubbish ,they are always throwing their old things and rubbish in public place ,the governement also cannot do their role towards their people and their bad behaviour We could find better ways to treat serious medical conditions with the help of computers. We could find ways to treat cancers and maybe even the common cold. he jump from his bed to the street and walk to his way to see what he did every morning.when he walk after the stranger man  he notice that he stopped in every trash in the street to take a look and go to the next one, and guess what he saw Michael and run away also Michael was afraid.

But, on the other hand, because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable; cars are so many; very noisy, unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth. Computers could also help us with our every day life. I am person that like going to do exercise, for this reason I like practise some sports, but the truth is that my favorite sport all around the world is the soccer.I believe that play soccer is an excellent activity, because in every game that the people can like always has to exist some rules. Firstly,the growing number of private cars cause the big problem with traffic jam .People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam.That wastes people's time and make people feel exhausted.Not mention to say,it's definitely hard to enjoy travelling in holidays.Secondly,private  cars are the main reason for the air pollution.We should consider the protection of environment for human future,not only care about the convenience we can see for now.

"Dear local newpaper: @CAPS1 you being the local newspaper, you have the power to say how you feel about the effects computers give to people. For one, the show played on television may enlight us and give us some enlightenment.Teleplay are not just for fun,it can have a deep meaning,short story tells big deal,just like a useful book.So,why not television cannot educate us? Espesialy there are a lot of greens these makes good health.However someone have to take care of them.The town have to do that and I think in England there are so many greens all around,so a lot of people take care of these that makes good environment.After I have been to live in England with my family I have goton the feel very much indeed. Its very simple and wonderful sport.If you play cricket you are surely going to burn many bad calories adhered inside your body.In India cricket is worshipped and players are the lord.The best part of this game is you can play with every age group at a single time.I was very interested in making my career through this but due to my studies I can't take effort toward this. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. He is hobbies  listen to music, play  computer game, watch the football match and watch  TV. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 quotes, ""I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. for example, lunch time travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emission of carbon mono oxide which is effected to red blood cells and irritate to breathing system. But today, Things are getting change and technology marked a significant role in our life, Automobile segment increased its vertical and having a car becomes a need from luxory. However, people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but if you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirly, if you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because if you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long. Although healthy diet is quite expensive young people follow special diet in order to have better body shape or healthy life.Actually modern life affected on our palate changing .Instance some people who work majority of their waking houres prefer to use fast food more.Our commitments imposes us to forget ourselves and our healthy . In conclusion, you will have great eye coordination, you will be able to research faraway places, and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online. @CAPS2, I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever if you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot!"	2

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Who is to label a book offensive? My name is Anna,I am a very cheerful person and I have a creative personality so I enjoy planning activities or organise sport events in a special and  colorful way.I really love childrens and take care of them ,I also had an experience  of working in summer camps and have a good experience doing delicious food because I already did this stuff in other camps.I think that I gave good reasons and I hope that you will accept me. All books and other arts were created to be read and enjoyed by people. Libraries banning books, music, movies, or magazines seems unreasonable since there is such a wide variety of people and their interests. Environment is the sorrounding.there is no aleartness in our locality.they were busy in their own work.everyone were not focus or see what hapening in our place.they use to speak about how hot today is?but they dont know what makes this much hot.iam interest in planting tree and makes sorrounding clean.some people used to burn forest as if those forest is useless.man are greedy  because of all the thing  getting from the forest are free. Though people @MONTH1 check these books out, many others find them either offensive or think they should not mix with every day books. Looking for any sport make you feel good and your brain be always refresh so that you  can begin your day with any sport to making fresh and after that you can make any job with refreshment mind. If you are living in big town or small It does matter but one thing should be taking care by the people and organiser of the town, is environment.Global warming  is huge issue in today's date. Why would a book be published, or written for that matter, if we were not intended to read it? Any book could be offensive to any one person. Any article, song, or film could be offensive. But, there will always be a crowd it appeals to. And that crowd deserves to enjoy every last word. In conclusion, for me it is a lie that the public transportation has no future, however, they have to make improvements to this like the use of better ways of fuel or energy, one way is using renovable sources of energy such as solar, haeolic (wind) or hidraulic(water),Also there are biodisel, and gasoline extracted from seaweed.And the public transportation will be more important in a few years than now. The solution to library censorship is the division of books into categories and sub-categories. But i was so mad at him and so ansiouns to make his life imposible, and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the sufering i had been throug became stronger and bigger, i had made a desition i was goingo to do it, if he dedicated 4 years of his life tourtoring me and not wanting me to be happy i would the time is nesesary for him to have a miserable life and i wont stop until i had acomplished my goald This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. This major involves all, always we have to consider the all possibilities to resolve  homework , you have to know the most possible information for can resolve it. Alison felt desesparate, she notice that her husband´s car were in her house, so he was walking or someone pick up to him, she takes the phone and she call all him group of friends, nobody now anything and now they were scaried.

195	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Tennis, tennis is not jsut a sport anyone can play but it's professional sport needs to more hard trainee and more time to be perfect in it, in first why I choose tennis?, seriously in 2003 this is my first time to watch the game on TV when I saw roger federer played I think he is the one that made me love this sport, due to it's professional motion in playing the ball, from this time I was interested in this game and watching all championship, so more time, time and time it was my favoirite sport. However, if I really had to make a choice between two options, I would prefer the latter, which is taking classes in specialized single subject. There are three reasons for this idea. First of all, classes in specialized one subject is helpful for students' career. There are a few people are using puplic transport, like students and someone had low income.in my veiw, i can say might be the puplictransport going to e close because nobody is going to beclose I think one of my favorites sports of all is the atletism I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself, you have to be every day better than you where yesterday, it force you to improve every time, also is an exercise that help all your body, especially the legs because it gives them great strength, but also your hands because they have to be in a constant movement, and all the body in general because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and help you to have coordination. Maybe someone said that wide range of knowledge can help us sometimes, but we should remember that deep knowledge, not wide knowledge is base for every jobs. most of girl doesnt like this,i think that it takes us energy,we need to do exercise,reasonable diet...and so on. My town do much efforts to care of environment,they put many pins in the streets to keep it clean also they prevent private drivinig at many days to keep air clean ,they seed trees to absorb co2 and release o2 ,they build factories away from the house of population to prevent respiratory diseases which is a result of air pollution from factories,so not only my country it self but also the individuals follow a proper way to keep environment clean. My favorite way to travel is the Plane because  I like to be fast and in my life, I hate a wait in my opinion the plane is the best for me for example when you want to go  somewhere you need to reach there so quick , you don't need to take time and The plane is the best travelling in the world that the best safer than other way  , you can see on the pollution of people who got an accident , how often an accident happen by the plane so anyway if it's happen,i can't imagine it , Eventually I wish everyone who like to travel is safe and sound and safe journey. Forcing student to take classes in subject that he dislike can make student to lose his passion for learning new things. Most importantly,manually inspected on each printed sheet in case that there would exist damaged sheets.Once damaged sheets are discovered, partically separate them into good and bad ones and them burn the bad notes,making sure that the remaining sheets are of good quality . As we can see from this example, make students to specialize in one subject could be better option. In conclusion the public transport is very good and if it desapear it will be a big problem, is right that some times you need a private transport but apart from that the public transport is very use by people of all ages. Personally, in my case, I can learn different computer language such as C and Java well after I learn much about python, which is programming language that easier to learn. As example shows, deep knowledge in one specific area can help to understand other topics in different area too. Firstly,the growing number of private cars cause the big problem with traffic jam .People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam.That wastes people's time and make people feel exhausted.Not mention to say,it's definitely hard to enjoy travelling in holidays.Secondly,private  cars are the main reason for the air pollution.We should consider the protection of environment for human future,not only care about the convenience we can see for now. So, I think that specializing in one subject is the first step for student to learn things in many subjects. My advice of finding work, is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work.But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase."	2

"Dear @CAPS1 times, @CAPS2 you think computers benefit society? Well I think so! I have played this sport for twelve years ago this sport has taught me to respect the other not assault to him.there is the only reason that makes me choose this sport is I don't want to be weak I wouldn't like to be nothing in this country that has a rule Strong dominated the weak.when I put my feet in the gym i forget everything shcool,home...therefore I enjoy it.I can't imagine my life without taekwondo it is my blood,my soul.taekwondo it is not a violent sport as many people say but what you have to know is what in the brain and the heart of players.I just get the 1st degree international black belt and I would like to tell to anyone he just starting this sport use your abilities and skills for the right things. Many citizens in our own community of watertown think computers are a great resource for many things while others disagree with this completely. last summer i worked at cinema.i think it is a very good job because you can see any films you like for free.The minus of this work is very big salary and i think that i will work at this cinema on the next summer. On both a computer and the internet there are more than @NUM1 million things you can learn. When you are struggling with homework a computer is a great resource. You can quickly open @CAPS3.com and search any topic at any time. For example, if you did not know a conversion it is easily found on the internet. For another,there are many different types of programs,which can broaden our eyes,they give details of education,plus other meaningful information，such as documentaries，talk show and so on.These programs are not just for killing the time,but for educating. There are websites such as nytimes.com and cnn.com that give you daily news. The best season to sale the ice cream from the van is autumn,while that is one of the worst season for indoor swimming pool.The discrepancy of these two place is large.The best sale achievement of the van is 4500,5000,5500respectively. On the computer you can find vacation sports you want to learn about and go to. my favorite sport is swimming i swim 2 times per a week sometimes i go to the swimming pool in the same area which i work there and sometimes i go to the swimming pool of my cousin, i enjoy when i spend my time in the water and now even i am pregnant i am afraid when i swim with a group of people i keep telling them and screaming do not close with me ! In the end, computers can teach you many things. I love to listen to British English, but it’s really hard to study, all because we are all learning American English in Taiwan, so when I have the opportunity to contact British English, it’s full of tone cadence, always feel particularly charming, and British culture exudes noble temperament, so British accent sounds like there is always an indescribable elegance qualities. When he was just about cursing the final line he got hurt and his mussels was dying and star to peel off a black matter, at that point the guys in suit thought that he won’t be able to cross the line , but when they saw that he kept running, they freeze the time and run after him, he stopped for a moment but then , he start running again and when he cross the line he woke up in a red somber fluid, he was wiped out from the matrix, he opened his eyes and saw a flying robot, suddenly he was on a wood wheelchair and they said that he would never be able to walk again , besides that, he stands up and tried to walk again. Environment is the sorrounding.there is no aleartness in our locality.they were busy in their own work.everyone were not focus or see what hapening in our place.they use to speak about how hot today is?but they dont know what makes this much hot.iam interest in planting tree and makes sorrounding clean.some people used to burn forest as if those forest is useless.man are greedy  because of all the thing  getting from the forest are free. Websites that were created for this include: facebook, myspace, and twitter. These free websites let you add friends, send messages, and post pictures. Web chatting is a way to video people. this situation to create many pollution for environment so we have more conscience for the planet health Lastly, emailing is a great way to inform people. my English   language is weak , I like to improve it which complete my post graduate study,      The reason for choosing this specifically English language  in September  future I would like to get to know more information about   an English language course . Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath...deep one and started to dive . Lastly, the computer is used for business. An application called microsoft office is used in countless bussinesses, microsoft office word, powerpoint, excel and @CAPS4. Each of these are used to plan, sell, present, manage, and write about products. Microsoft is something you should download in the near future. First of all,we should thinking out a design and dicide the background colour and artwork,or even security issues.And then for the preparation of metal plates ,the skilled and machinists is considerate.Nect,printing,sheets of bank notes printed (50 bank notes per sheet)colour on both sides,and specWell,the most important step is inspection,we should printed sheets manually inspected. A production company can be face to face with a company from china without being in the room with them. I used to live for a short time in a place where word recycle was completely ignored but they used to this because that wasn't so rich. Finally, computers are used when manufacturing a product in or at a business. for carreer has 80% under 26 years old students are taken it, for the age over 49 years old only has 20%people are taken; but if you counper interest, it is totoly different; for under 26 years old have only 10%; but for over 49 years old it has 70%. People complaint about how the information about different TV shows don't contribute in the process of learning, that's why many of This programmes are considered trash, because of the multiples shows such as realities, talk shows,or showbiz that hardly ever have a good message or something interesting for people. In the end computers are a necessary item in a business. In conslusion, computers have a great affect on people. the development technology and Industry very fast , so the public transport no future , Must be Interesting the development transport Even fits the times. I like going to the cinema, get out with my friends,  to playing the counter strike, walking to the park, going the shopping and can't stand watching the blood. Lastly, businesses would not run well without a computer. At first, I had called a travel agent but he said he couldn’t be able to book me a flight before two months, so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent. Also you can interact with your friends and family, and there are many applications used for business. In my school ages I did not participate any programme even sports.Because school teachers never encourage me to participate.If they told me to attend compulsory I will do without any hesitation. Suddenly we heard the sound of running footsteps.Then there was a cry and the footsteps stopped.Nervously,we walked back.Perhaps someone had been killed,or kidnapped in the street We were going to see what happened ,and we had something to see.There was one old granny who was beat up.We try to gave her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that.Than we were trying to find help ,but nobody was opening doors.On our luck I had a mobile phone ,but Michael was saying that we need to escape because we did not know are those bullies near the corner.My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I've done that. In case of transportation technology, in this twenty first century we have various option like Plan that can fly with the cloud, train that fast and big enough that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time."	2

"Dear @CAPS1, I @CAPS2 that computers has benefits to society. First, it gives and teaches you social skills. Next, computers can help you learn new things online. Finally, computers also teach you hand-eye coordination. In the following you will see why I @CAPS2 computers have its benefits to the society. On the rest of the boring week, I was watching TV and suddenly my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet, so I decided to solve my Paris puzzles with my sister, which was less than a half solved for about one year but it had too much color in the sky so I didn't finished then a year ago. I am also committed to preparing monthly reports for newspaper supplement “The Voice of Women” which issued by the WATC “Women's Affairs Technical Committee , and I have the cooperation with the Environment and Development the magazine which issued by Center for development work ""Maan"", annd other web sites and news and media organizations. Therefore, you can learn about their culture and what they do in their country. I grew up in a parent family.Sometimes I felt that I was alone and not loved.However,we were lucky enough to have a great mother who tried  all her best to keep my older brother，my older sister and I for completing our college studies .Of course my uncle ,young brother of my mother gave a big hand to go through the hard,so that made us often help each other in my family when the member who was in hard.Especially I was the youngest member in the family ,made much more troubles when I was young . So as you can see, Computers has its benefits because it can teach you social skills. there was also a cup in it,It said""don't give up your dream,keep doing!go!we stand by you!come on""  Tom love it ,""thanks mom,thanks dad! for example, you can learn how to use a computer if you don't already know how. Also, you could play online learning games for free or buy a @CAPS3 with more options for learning. Another example is you can look up recent or past events you want to know about and research it. I do currently master but I can devote myself to the Fellowship Especially since I finished the Pre-Masters and now I need only follow-up from time to time with my guide Academic, so I have the time for the Fellowship . Finally, computers how its benefits because it teaches you hand-eye coordination. I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens.So I do not agree with this afirmation, in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport. Also if you just want time to go by you can use the computer as entertainment by chatting with other and playing games. But today, Things are getting change and technology marked a significant role in our life, Automobile segment increased its vertical and having a car becomes a need from luxory. In conclusion, computers have its benefits to the social community. Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath...deep one and started to dive . Next, you can learn about any subject online for free if your not the one paying the internet bill finally, it benefits you by teaching you hand-eye coordination. As Automotive Industries are huge in market, most of the  house holders  prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time ."	2

"Because you are the best teacher in the whole world!many of our class classmate really like you too!We know that you are going to teach  Discovery-bay  primary school .My English result is  better once  you taught me I really love you, Ms Cumings!your friend Ms Decock told me that  she is going to Australia ,and I love you two both I hope you that you will come back some times ! Millions of people read and listen to those materials every day. Invention of car has made people's lives easier.No more they have to solely depend on public transport.Though public transport are cheaper and one could get to know many companions ,increase network.But public transport has fixed schedule and on a rushing day not many can really enjoy their journey. Moreover also simple things are changed, for example the food we eat: some times ago everythingh was natural, healthy... but now everyone eat always ""junk food"" and thinghs like that, which are completely unhealthy ! Everyone has the right to read and watch what they want and not everyone will read or watch the same materials. Although some materials @MONTH1 be offensive, they should not be removed from the libraries. The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years Everyone has a right to their own beliefs and opinions. If someone wants to read a book or watch a video, they should be able to. What is offensive and what is not is a personal choice and it all depends on that person's point of view. If someone thinks the content in a book, song, or movie is offensive, then they should not read or listen to it. Reduce the fast food that make people obese and not healthy.It will be better if you gave drinks compared to the weather like whenever its winter we would like a hot drink and if it is summer we would like a chilled drink. Take, for example, the @CAPS1. There are thousands of books on the @CAPS1 and many movies as well. These materials should not be removed from library shelves because even though some people find them offensive, they can be used to teach people how horrible it was so that it does not happen again. People should inform themselves about something before they view it so that they are not offended by the content inside. The social networks such as: Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,Google plus... are connecting  us to more and more friends, companies, public figures, books, films, social organizations...we are really have many things to see, to think, to ""like"", to ""comment"" and a dozen of stuffs that we can make an action to interactive with others...so may it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves, to take care our healthy. Good Morning: This is an esay about my favourite sport,it is swimming since I was a child because always enjoy a lot and what is more I can do it alone, I never refuse to go swimming pool and less in summer, of course. Most content that some people find offensive is for adult audiences. There are not children's books that talk about things that parents would find offensive to their children. Summer holiday, I have been to Italy on holiday 3 years ago.I didn't have a long holiday ,it was just for 3 days but these 3 days were the best in my life.I must say that I went there because my sister is living there so I didn't have to book a room at the hotel and spending too much money.I went to the Vatican and Rome,I saw their massive buildings which were impressive and their old houses.The weather was fantastic ,I love bathing in the sun and resting on the hot sand on the beach. According to the problems above mentioned,various approaches that governmentshould be adopted to deal with this problem.first of all,reducing building constructure from now on,planting more trees instead.Sustainadle development should be awaness to all human and start to porteat the environment and preserve the animals. In the @LOCATION1, there is freedom of speech and people should be able to say what they want to say. n the town he tries that the people have to aware about the sitiations and they take care  the environment   On the other hand, the ask is if this solution could be enough or no. Secondly, the Hall doesn't matter with the environment; for example, the Hall stopped with garbage's selection collection when the new major assumeded the hall. we all know that do sport is very important to keep our life healthy and happy.My favourite sport actually is walking;and I prefer walking in the morning and before sundown.I like also walking in public street,gardens,clubs and on the shore.when i want to go anywhere;I do my best to go on foot.I like this sport since my childhood because I found that I can think about my good time when I was child and relax with myself to think carefully about my present and future.The walking can also fitness and do the knee stronger.It would be interesting to accompain your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time.I advice my guys who suffer from laziness and overweight,try to walk one hour at least and after that they will like this sport. It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs.In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us.In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable. The libraries are public and they are shared. we bocome not only older but also wiser .we learn but the most useful thing to learn is to get in alot of experiences & for sure to make mistakes .but we have to be honest with our selves by admitting our mistakes to avoid them in the future . Michael and Kate was so  happy, until one day that Michael said to him dream to be a super hero, Kate get so nervous saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid dream and that Michael was only dreaming but that would never happen and that super hero don’t exist."	2

Spanih´s food is fantastic, althouh there are a lot of restaurant for eat you and i think that the food is more expensive than your country.If you don´t like spanish´s food you can go restaurant the other country, but i know you love it. Computers help society by providing us with search engines and educational resources allowing us to connect easily with friends and family, helping us communicate importances and plan things and a lot more. First, computers have become a vital part of education and research a like. I have joined football-teams which is near to my home, I prefer to this team because of my family is not reach, they can not provide for my transportation fees to go exercises stadium. But in some country, You can use underground (metro) , it is very advanced than old types like Bus or Taxi,The underground is faster and clean and arranged . That's right online universities are beginning to form. This is great for moms who want to get a degree but have to stay home with their children. Also, computer technology has been applied to research in science and hospitals. New discoveries have advanced with the help of computers that will actually help people's lives! Computers are used to search for a cure to cancer disasters such as earthquakes, and even help see a disease someone has before its symptoms even begin to occur! Computers have helped save lives and benefit lives in ways people never could have imagined sixty years ago. Secondly, computers allow people to connect and reconnect with other people around the @CAPS2. I have joined football-teams which is near to my home, I prefer to this team because of my family is not reach, they can not provide for my transportation fees to go exercises stadium. The possibilities are endless. Email has also been very beneficial to society as well, as @CAPS5 helps people communicate and plan events, which brings me to my next topic. in a car accident , when she her what happened with her brother she was so nervous then the miracle happened she found a big suitcase in the train she decided to open the bag because no one was in the train so she opened the bag she surprised when she saw  a lot of money inside the bag  . squash sport also can be played individually as two players together or in team of 4 players.squash one of the very nice attractive sports i dont think the public transport does not have future, there are a lot of people who can not buy a car and has to use the communite transport. Also, is an amazing website that combines education with the aspect of @CAPS2 @CAPS5 quizzes you on different levels of general knowledge and for each correct answer, @ORGANIZATION1 donates @NUM1 grains of @ORGANIZATION1. television serves the multipurpose of entertaining and educating people.in order to cope up the competiting world and get recognized in the corperative world one must strive hard,which in turn increases their stress levels.Television has become one of the means to reduce the stress levels.besides providing entertainment television has also become a source of information. To conlude, computers have proven to benefit the @CAPS2 and all in @CAPS5, not only people but the environment, too. As long as i try to keep doing thing on a ecofriendly way i realize that i am give a little from my side and i feel careful of my environment."	2
200	"If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"Hiring Workers; Experienced Workers or Workers with Low Salary
     
     The question has been raised so far with regard to whether an experienced worker with high salary is better than an inexperienced worker with low salary or not in terms of an employer, and it is still controversial. Although healthy diet is quite expensive young people follow special diet in order to have better body shape or healthy life.Actually modern life affected on our palate changing .Instance some people who work majority of their waking houres prefer to use fast food more.Our commitments imposes us to forget ourselves and our healthy . Although some people might claim that hiring inexperienced worker with lower salary is better, I believe that experienced workers with higher salary is much better for two reasons which will be explored in this essay. To begin with, the most crucial reason is that the effiency of working is high. To be more specific, since the experienced workers are already familiar to their works, employers do not need to worry about the time limitation. For example, if the inexperienced worker has to do some complex work at first, then he or she has to do some extra studying about the method to do such work or information about that. I would like to say for anyone wants playing soccer to be very careful when he plays it because it may cause a lot of injures ,but in the same time it is very nice game. In addition to the notion of efficency, there is a possibility that workers can do a demonstration about their salary. The reason is that they may not be satisfied with their salary or the environment of their workplace. My father's experience is a compelling illustration of this. In my father's company, demonstrations do occur frequently while the workers argue that the amount of salary is too low comparing to the amount of their work. However, my father, who is an employer, always says that he cannot agree with them because they do not even do their work well. Only if the government develop more technical property,pay more attention to the environment protection ,such as build more trees and grass in the cities ,and set a special low for those missed animals will help decrease the harm that the building project brings to us. Therefore, no such problem will occur if an employer hire workers with high salary. Nevertheless, some people still argue that the company will have some economical problems if they hire workers at a high salary. Further to the trade fair of the last week where we were a pleasure to meet you and we were talking about you courses. That is to say, to educate new workers to have some experience of complicated works, much more money will be needed to give such opportunities. Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real. he said kindly:""I buy you a present,open it,Tom"" Tom opened the big bag,Oh!This is a big surprise,there was a football in it,which he always wanted to buy there were some words goal!keep doing! the development technology and Industry very fast , so the public transport no future , Must be Interesting the development transport Even fits the times. If the person want to become bowler then concentrate on running,action,stance and for batsmen need concentration on lag and bat coordination,eye and bat coordination,discover some shots which became key factor in batting. I love to work in the summer camp job to make the exercise every shop in usa should make the summer camp job , I am the right person to work because I'm very exercise and I' love to work in the kitchen, because i am the right chief in the summer camp job."	2

"The amount of computer usage has been significantly growing over the years. Adults and children are spending huge amounts of their time on computers. I have to say that study another language give you more opportunities  because on these days you need to now other language to look for a work and be more inteligent than your college to take the work and that’s great. There are many sports grounds for example tennis cort,football grounds and play equipment for child so I think my town takes care of environment that makes everyone will be able to best condition in both mind and body long time. Computers are being used for more then just work. It seems to be the peoples new way of comunication. This book made me interesting and I begging reading more and more while I read the more I love it  this time everything  did not matter to me I want to finish the book  as soon as possible I do not know the end but I want the end of the book was amazing but the same time I do not finish the book because the mystery to open up finished in. In the future,people will go out of the Earth .Because of the damage,people on the ground can't survive.When they want to find foods,there will be nothing.Even of the grass can't alive on earth.Thought,but most people do not be the member of the team of alive.Cause of lots of damage,but they didn't Take responsibility.I wonder for sixteen years.And I don't know if they were change their mind in after the next fifty years. Though computers seem to abuse the privlage of communication. For talking on an online chat sight is easier and more convient for people. The people in those charts are not always sho they claim to be. Transportation is very important in cities,villages as well as in sub-lines.Many people has no vehicles,they only depends on public transport due to some reasons.Any way in some cases,car is very useful to reach the destination very fast. These children fo not always know who they are talking to, but @CAPS3 its online they say anything that into their mind. The son of Lucy and her husband one day he went to caved holes in the dirt for make a game, he make five holes and in the last one he found a brilliant jewelry that had been generations of gods so he started throwing that for play, one time that he take the jewelry, it consume the mind of the little guy and that cause that the jewelry liberated some sounds that only giants can hear so a mountain stand up that was the face of a giant and he perceive negative waves so he kill the guy because he had the most important relic of the gods. When communicating with people on the computer the writer tends to short hand things. Such as the word ""you"" would be spelled ""u"". Environment is the sorrounding.there is no aleartness in our locality.they were busy in their own work.everyone were not focus or see what hapening in our place.they use to speak about how hot today is?but they dont know what makes this much hot.iam interest in planting tree and makes sorrounding clean.some people used to burn forest as if those forest is useless.man are greedy  because of all the thing  getting from the forest are free. We the management of The Arch London Hotel received your mail and wishes to let you know that you should make known to us the position you desired to work in via return mail along with a scan copy of your signed contract of agreement to enable us make every necessary corrections.Thank you. It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. The other matter is about our habit to eating food together with our family that were a custom in humanity life not just in our culture,but now because of hard and busy life ,we had to eat our meal  mostly days of a week. For their spelling will soon become and the vocabulary will be, or all in slang. We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben, which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye.To got to the Big Ben we took the underground, but to get to the London Eye a red bus.After 3 days we went home.I forgot to tell you something about homeless people.A lot of people are homeless, which is sad, but maybe we can change it. IN my country peole do alot of mistake and have alot of of bad habits concerning their attitude towards the rubbish ,they are always throwing their old things and rubbish in public place ,the governement also cannot do their role towards their people and their bad behaviour No one ever needs to go anywhere if all theire communication can be done at home. I start this sport since I was 10 years old.where my father was playing this sport also,but he started it when he was more greater than me,He was about 30 years old.where squash is one of the games that can be played in any age,I love this game because I find it making exercise to all the body in the same time , we are running in small place moving hands in stretched and different ways in the same time you are working your mind in the same time so it need caring and quik thinkink, as much exercise you will find down the road . The less time people spend outside the more energy is being wasted. The times @CAPS2 do go outside is for simple tasks such as taking out the trash. This is hurting our environment! There are not as many people taking care of our planet. People are not taking the to make a garden, plant some tree's or simply pick up some trash on the side of the road. pain and gain  This movie is bases quote on quote on a ""true story"" buts obviously director michael bay know for the transformers franchise puts a lot of hollywood into this movie, its about a bodybuilder named daniel lugo who decides to kidnap a rich guy and make him sign away all of his properties, which obviously its not a great plan that backfires on him, and eventualy police get him. I have learned to  get control of myself when someone teaes me , and to be alert as well .Also ,it helps to look always slim and put me away from the ghost of obesity as well .People who want to start playing karate have to be patient . So please help yourselves and the earth stop talking on the computers and get out and do something productive. The computer will always be there, but @CAPS2 only have one of us and one ofour planet. @CAPS2 dont want to destroy these over a simple piece of technology."	2

That is ludacris. There are so many alternatives then to just take those certain books off the shelves completely. Playing the cricket will also gives physical exercise to our body.we can bowl,batt,field in the cricket which  requires lot of  physical activities. Alison felt desesparate, she notice that her husband´s car were in her house, so he was walking or someone pick up to him, she takes the phone and she call all him group of friends, nobody now anything and now they were scaried. It is totally unnecessary for children to be reading such explicit material, but it is possible for us to prevent it. hello, i want the job for the summer camp i'm looking for children between 8-12 years old i will help to organise sports and evening activities and if you want i could work in the kitchen if i have the job write soon                                                                   victoria I know that libraries tend to have opposite corners of the library dedicated to adult materials and childrens materials, but there should be more strict rules of kids being in the adult section. Firstly, the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel.Secondly, the public vehicle route are more far than usual route.Thirdly,it is also crowded and no privacy.Finally,there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker. For example maybe the childs' parents only will allow him/her to get materials from the children's section in the library; therefore if that child wants a material from a different area of the library they cannot get it, unless his/her parents are their telling the librarian the child is allowed to get it. I know when i was a child and i couldn't do something that my parents were doing, it made me feel upset, but now that i look back i realize why they wanted me not to do what they were doing. One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance,  homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society. They knew if i was reading or listening inapropriate materials then i was growing up way too fast. You can see some store fridge around the market for Drinks and Dairy like milk, yogurt, cheese, butter and cream Also chest freezers for Ice creams .In a corner, they sell cosmetics and a salesperson helps customers to find their required . To conclude, lets keep those filthy books and magazines away from the younger kids. At first and important change is about eating prepared food that isn't healthy usually,its reason probably woman's life stile that is going to big change in the way that they don't like staying at home and spend their time to making food ,now they prefer to buy prepared good. Frist of all at home we recycle plastics, glasses, papers and cartons, oils, clothes, batteries, organics in an especial composting bank where we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials and finally all the other things are sends to an especial tip where we avoid to drop it anywhere."	2
203	"If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"Nowadays, there are some hot issue about job. The picture below illustrates how to make bank notes.First is to design the note,including background color,artwork and security issues.Second is to prepare mental plates as well as qulified machinists.Then is printing with special ink.When the one side is printed,raising the images slightly to make opposite to be colored.Last is the key step,inspection.It is of importance to inspect the printed sheets.If the sheet is good or partialy damaged,it can be packed and delivered by veichals after cutted in to separate notes.Otherwise ,the sheets and notes would be abandoned and destroyed in the fire. It is true that an experienced worker is better than an inexperienced worker with same salary. I don't think there is no future for public transport.Especially in urban, for example, Taipei city in Taiwan.People who lives there almost know the convenient public transport called MRT, it's fast, cheaper and doesn't have to find the parking lot. If we have to pay more for experienced worker,  many people don't prefer experienced worker than inexperienced worker. However, if I was an employer, I would prefer to hire an experienced worker at a higher salary than an inexperienced worker at a lower salary for three reasons : ability, efficiency, and safety. Hey my name is Joe and i´m 21 years old and i´l think i´l would compliment the summer camp very good, because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak. Experienced workers are people who wanted from other companies. It means that they have something better than the others. Dear USA Summer camp I reply to your advertisement for work with children this summer in summer camps, have looked after children aged 5-10 and it was a fantastic experience, worked at school in north Africa like a volunteer and learnt a lot about children,  think that i'm a suitable person for the job because use to be an energetic and cheerful person and very hardworking, love working with children and  like organising several types of activities, I'm not very good cooking but i can learn very fast. think has a future that all people use public transport then I think that maybe continue to have future but has bad and good things , for example good is easier to move in the city and you save time, and the bad , bad people attack you and steal things, but I thing ,that have future ,because a lot people even they use public transport to. We're looking for a new nice home and so we are truly interested to keep your place tide and take care about it as it were our own. When we hiring an inexperienced worker, we have to teach them how to work from beginning. Volleyball its my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I were in another world, in which I can be free and happy, apart of this, when I am bad, this is a distration of the university. So someone have to work with an inexperienced worker, and it leads efficient to lower than hiring an experienced worker. Then ,the notes will be prepared with metal plates .After that ,printing ,the notes will be printred in colour on  both sides with special ink and it will images sightly raised . Experienced workers have less possibilities that they make trouble or bad issue about work. However, compared to the line of indoor swimming pool,the difference of seasonal achievement of ice cream van is considerably large.Overall,the achievement of ice cream van is better than the indoor swimming pool,from about 1100 to 5500. It may become a lose of our company. I used my car every day however few a few I started to take public transport for I can to save up money These reasons explain why experienced workers are valuable to paid higher salary. Therefore, inexperienced workers who looking for work have to improve themselves to compete with experienced workers. Then, employers will noticed it, and try to hire them."	2

"Dear Local Newspaper: Are computers possitively affecting society? Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real. for example, lunch time travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emission of carbon mono oxide which is effected to red blood cells and irritate to breathing system. After reading this letter there will be no doubt that computers have a possitive effect on people in society. this situation to create many pollution for environment so we have more conscience for the planet health public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it is kind of becoming cheaper and also more safe but some  people prefer cars to extent do we agree with and what is our reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay  before about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was not even good facility to move from place to other and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans at the beginning the faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve it by the end nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and planes .some people prefer cars because the do like crowded places or because the find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places  to summaries it is different from some oneis opinion to another i predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end cars will disappear and will will no longer be used Everyone expects to see the flawlessly inked letters on the printer paper in whatever piece of writing it is. one day Micheal wanted to go out from his home so he called his besfriend an suggested to go out togther , his friend agreed , so Michael weared his closes , wnet out and closed the door but at this moment he knew he had made a mistake . In additio, it is easier to read someone's writing @CAPS1 its typed, especially @CAPS1 the writer has hand writing. However, computers help in more than just writing papers. MEASURES IN FAVOUR OF TAKING CARE THE ENVIRONMENT The council is carrying out a project in order to erradicate the rubbish in my town.This project is focused on separating the rubbish in each green points of the city and also they have to maintain their neighbourhood as clear as are possible. Many websites online these days have social networks such as youtube, facebook, twitter, and myspace. And to day is necessary because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversation with their you need to now more than your foreign language, because in the rest of the world and particularly in Europe people now more than two language and that great. I don´t have friends who like swimming, almost like football or similar teams sports, and always I go alone it isn´t boring for me furthermore, I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I haven´t wait anybody. although traveling by car is really interesting but still using public transport has its advantages ,by using public transport you're saving  effort when  driving a car for along distance you will get tired , some people don't have enough money to buy their own car . as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! That is a big help with everyone's social life, keeping then us ""the "" @CAPS2, online sites like eharmony or match.com take people with little time to worry about love and match them with their perfect mate. I  like to spend time cute little kids and  cooking is my favourite hobby.In the evening I would like to spend some time with those kids by organising some indoor and outdoor games for them.I would feel more energtic throughout the day If I have some busy or tight scheduled work,I have come across your advertisement For this job and I really think that I would suit this job in every aspect because I have a friendly move with people in and around me.I would be pleased to know for your positive reply. This helps people live happier lives, another possitive effect. Finally, computers possitively effect people by making research much easier. My dad always says ""You kids got it easy. @CAPS1 I was growing up, we'd to go to the library and spend hours researching before we could write our papers."" @CAPS3, its simple. Using the internet and a search engine, all you have to do is type a topic and you can get all the latest articles in just seconds. To sum it up I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convinient.Public future unless they have project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger. I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked.Pleasure to work at concerts is when  I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate.The experience  is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert. The internet is also an extremely useful help @CAPS1 the research topic is very specific, if its a certain becteria or species that a book @MONTH1 only briefly mention. The internet has a much broader range of articles, so it is much easier to find information for any topic. With research, taking less time to understand, people can spend more time enjoying the day, like playing outside, than in the library stressing because they cannot find a book on their topic. This is a strong reason why computers should not be seen as a negative effect on society. Moreover also simple things are changed, for example the food we eat: some times ago everythingh was natural, healthy... but now everyone eat always ""junk food"" and thinghs like that, which are completely unhealthy ! secondly these mode of transportation covers      as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routine who travelled by public transportation.as a consquence generally people avoid travelling by public transportation finally i can say that there are various mode of transporotation avaliable  to competition with public transportation. This process involves five main stages.First,it should take some considerations in design,including background colour,artwork,security issues.Next,skilled machinists is prepared ,in which there are metal plates.Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet).Subsequently, the technical must be used specially for distinction,for example the colour printed on both sides,Special ink is used and imges slightly raised.After this,printed sheets will be inspected carefully.According to the quality of sheets,it will be two results.if the quality is good or the bank notes is partially damaged which can be used,it would cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and disoatched.while those bad sheets will be securely destroyed. What about how hours of research are @CAPS3 two clicks away? Computers have changed our lives for the better, and we should appreciate all the do for us."	2

"we will know today some of information about Islam , Islam is great religion come from The Arabian Peninsula and its founded since 1436 years ago. Although there are materials that @MONTH1 me harmful to children, freedom of information is far more importiant than protection because censorship is unconstitutional, prevents readers from an impartial perspective, and in some cases hides pressing societal issues that are deemed improper by the censors. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 states that freedom of speech, religion and the press shall not be denied or abridged. In more general terms, the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 grants freedom of expression. The One of the most amazing thing that attractive you, is that it has  safari  which is more enjoyable thing ,at the sometime,it is introducing you to a wildlife  without needs to go out from your city. It prevents freedom of expression. Students and scholars alike cannot access all information that should be avaliable to them if not for censorship. Although private business and libraries can be permitted to censor because they have their own contracts that permit this, public libraries and schools are effectively breaching the constitution when they censor. I think in the future don't exist public transport because we will drive their car.When you drive your own transport ,a car for example, you going to from a specificlly place but in a bus you go to the bus stop and no to your house or school, work... It is better from the people be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person. Censors often ban particular books because of personal views of alleged 'immorality.' @CAPS5 a clear and complete access to all information, how can one make any valid conclusion about anything? If, for example, one wants to learn the difference between an agnostic philosophy and a deist one, but has no access to any agnostic books, which were banned by intolerant religious zealots, you cannot effectively learn anything. Every special interest group wants to ban a certain type of material. Another example of why lives are gonna changed completely in 50 years is because also that connection between others cultures make People concern more about her own health, the expectations of life and the way they want to live it, because everyday will be easier to see how much are we hearting the earth so we will see faster the impacts that this brings to our life. She always tell me some jokes but some times i laughed !,i love her so much,i don't know how will my world being like without her and i won't to know . @CAPS6 this is true. If every special interest group deems it proper to censor material that is against their interests, there will be no material left. There will be no knoledge left. Withought knowledge, we as a human race are left in the dark. Many books are banned that address great problems of society. @PERSON3's @CAPS7 @NUM1 addressed the growing problems of censorship and the dangers of technology. As the fireman @CAPS8 @PERSON4 burnt books, so ironically the novel was censored. Perhaps this is a ploy by the censors to defend theire special interest, that is censorship. In the public transport you don't have your own sit so sometimes you travel standing which is not very comfortable and in winter you don't have air conditioning so if it's cold in the outside it's cold inside the transport to, sometimes you have to travel with sick people that can transmit you the illness. A novel by @PERSON2, @CAPS9 @CAPS10, was banned. In addition, A general vision on the human innovation show that the majority of people creations have bad effect, this effect exist even in people's lives or themselves. I agree that communiting by car is easier and faster than most of the public transportation; however, there are serious problems come after it; the amount of vehicles on the roads keep increase and make congestion and pollution which are far more severe than the inconvenience causing by public transportation. My studies in tecnologico de Monterrey are demanding and challenging because it has a very high educative score all worldwide, but also has to many good things, for example we have a lot of interchanges all around the world, when you have the opportunity to do an interchange you have to deal with the language and the culture with the other country, that means you have to be responsible for studying the basics things of that country, but all of this is worthwhile because when you are there you have so much fun. I think it would be important that, not only in the family, but also in the school could be grow a new generaion sensible to ecological problems of the earth. Although there are many works that are meaninglessly violent, brutal and cruel, no book or any other material should be censored. so it become a fashion of using personal vehicle which create a lot of problem big one traffic problem..... now traffic problem is the biggest problem. When printing finished,they should inspection.It the most important step.Printed sheets manually inspected.Finally,they  found good quality sheets and some partially damaged sheeets or bad sheets.They will packaging and distribution the sheets which is good in there.In that time they at fist cut into separate bank notes ,second they packed the sheets and diapatched. My favorite sport is swimming.I engaged in swimming in nine years old.I had gotten first prize in a match.As a result,I think that I have some intellent on swimming.Since then,I meet my teacher in the pool.She teach me a lot of things,and be the most important figure in my life.She is a doctor,she told me that swimming will let my body more better.From then on,I fell my disease in decreasind and fell relax.Consequently,I need to swim usually."	2

"Dear @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 people believe that computors are harmful to our society because people spend more time on such technology. In our earth, Hunderds of millions prople living in here.Except us, There are also a large number of wildlife. Firstly,the growing number of private cars cause the big problem with traffic jam .People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam.That wastes people's time and make people feel exhausted.Not mention to say,it's definitely hard to enjoy travelling in holidays.Secondly,private  cars are the main reason for the air pollution.We should consider the protection of environment for human future,not only care about the convenience we can see for now. we bocome not only older but also wiser .we learn but the most useful thing to learn is to get in alot of experiences & for sure to make mistakes .but we have to be honest with our selves by admitting our mistakes to avoid them in the future . It is very difficult to deny the importance of family in our life,  definitely families play an essential role community structure .According to the experts we can't create  successful society without creative families , and one another specific part of your life is a good partners surrounding your daily activities. After an exhausting afternoon, Peter has a bit of luck, infact his father Jack has just came back from the work, so he could get to take the milk and giving him a passage. In conclusion the public transport is very good and if it desapear it will be a big problem, is right that some times you need a private transport but apart from that the public transport is very use by people of all ages. Legal websites allow people to be informed of a friend or family about events that have ocurred like an incident or an up coming event. @CAPS2 experts like @PERSON1, who specializes in the behavior of people, says that this is a number one cause of obeisity and prevents people from meeting other people outside or even plain exercise. I would say this isn't completely true because before even talking to anyone. Online people usually go for a jog around the neighborhood. There are denying that the environment are changed by behavior of people and animals.For instance, people need to many places to build the modern society,so they fall down lots of trees,burnning many glasses.Another factor that the animals are not control themmselves to eat the plaints lend to distriction of ecosystem . A computor can give us certain information like news and whether report. These days every smart person would go search information on a computor for not only missed news but for future forecast on whether to plan a picnic. This would be a helpful tool to our society in order to keep up with the world and not miss the latest event. I believe this is an advance in our modern day society because you could get the information you need. When you are in a rush to go to work don't you end up losing papers and files just forgetting about them? The computor can send data to a computor to conviently copy a file or document so you won't have to rush to work and worry about lost files. It has been known that thirty out of fifty people have saved themselves from losing a job from a computor. Sizdehbedar: It means Thirteenth day of spring , on this day people going picnic and spent the day out of  their homes on the nature because they believe that Thirteen number that brings bad luck for them . You could send that file and listen to it on another computor. Does why, is easy to believe that if things continue with this rhythm and transforming everything, in a closer future of 50 years everything is gonna be completely knew and different. i think that this is the guestion for every one, and the answer can't be one for all, cause, someone can use public transport, and economy by this not only money, but and the environment, but some people don't like to use p.t., cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple don't like to travell with another people. If you need certain information than you could find it on a computor without ever leaving your comfortable home. In the reconquest age the stronghold never downfall with a direct assault, finally the Castellan's army after a large siege force to the government surrender it. So go and type that letter to a representative to help people see that computors are good for our society."	2
207	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"In modern life,we rely on traffic to work or travel to everywhere.It is conveninet to travel by private cars .The price of private cars which every one can afford it,so that everyone has the private car nowadays .Some people point out private cars are going to replace the public transport . The impacts? The results? Good morning everyone,today I want to share about is my favorite sport.My favorite sport is football,why I choose it?Well,football is a international sport,people around the world will love it so much!Example like Barclay Premier League,Liga Premier,Fifa World Cup and so on.I believe that's all will delighted us.By the way,my favorite football team is Manchester United,they are brilliant,they have an amazing football players,and they are awesome. Most importantly,manually inspected on each printed sheet in case that there would exist damaged sheets.Once damaged sheets are discovered, partically separate them into good and bad ones and them burn the bad notes,making sure that the remaining sheets are of good quality . while we are spendind good time watching TV our brain is not in calm, only in an other position different to that ones in the rest od the day.That's why I think that it's a good momento to see the thing through a new glass and that can be a very high opportunity. Who says the only way to contact or communicate with someone is through letters or the phone? The technology brought upon using computers allows people to talk online with others in a fast, easy, enjoyable way. Education has a crucial part in one society and it’s future and by improving the level of educations system, students can learn more effectively in their entire education life and their career but also their skills will be improved by this process. Write a letter! last summer i worked at cinema.i think it is a very good job because you can see any films you like for free.The minus of this work is very big salary and i think that i will work at this cinema on the next summer. The computer is an easy alternative for communication. Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real. This helicopter had humid then the helicopter star to rotate in all the island then the helicopter go sinking in the water then the hurricane finished  the engineers start to distribute the food and medicine. In other way, I never be a witness , what I have to do?, tell me what cain of suit have the witnees have to wear, If I have to buyany colour of tie, the flower.... really I'm very exciting with your wedding. Good Morning: This is an esay about my favourite sport,it is swimming since I was a child because always enjoy a lot and what is more I can do it alone, I never refuse to go swimming pool and less in summer, of course. The mind is an extrordinary thing. It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs.In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us.In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable. We were all excited, those from Lala Band minunate.Their voices have positive vibration through their musical and give you a good feeling.On the scene moves very well and know how to take pleasure to the public.I am feeling wonderful and my promise is that when going to have a special occasion to go to a concert supported by Lala Band, you will be with me.As like this in all my heart.I hope as those recounted by me in this mail and you feel a slight vibration from the concert. The computer allows you to learn about far away places and important people without making that trip to the library. Have you ever heard of online colleges? They are advertised on @CAPS2.V. all the time. Some people @MONTH1 think that learning from home, laying in bed with a laptop placed in front of them is a distractive way to learn. But what about being comfortable and not intiminated by anyone else around you? this country are many interesting pLaces to visit,if you wantto have adventure you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza.If you want to have fun you may go to parque de la Costa there are many interesting rolercoasters.And if you want to go the best museum of art in Argentina you should go to malba. Hand-eye coordinatin is an excellet and wonderful thing to have. Along with videogames, computer games teach you exactly that. you are responsible for your workers and the customer satisfaccion, However is very satisfying to see how your own company is grow up and your customers return again because they loved your job. Computers are key when it comes to pysicological learing. As well, we have to promote that the people get jobs close their accommodation or get the accommodation close to the jobs, because we have too much pollution and we could reward the companies that hire staff close to the place of job, maybe in a circle of 4 kilometres, as well we could reward the people that turn their accommodation for live near to the job or for going  there by a bicycle. Hand-eye coordination allows us to catch a ball or play sports, and computers help us acheive that."	2
208	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Censorship is the most foul and terrifying part of society. It gives the students the freedom to choose his major and the teachers.In addition, it has a lot of facilities that serve students like kindergarten that takes care of children these employees, university housing, hospital the student of medicine can be application in it and it serves the people too, and a big library has many books in various languages. Until recently we had the freedom to convey our thoughts, no matter what those thoughts were, in any form of media. But now if something is found to be offensive in any way it is essentially burned. Censorship limits our freedoms, takes away our @CAPS2 as citizens and people, shields us from the truths of the world, and limits the knowledge we can take from, as well as ensuring that one day there will be nothing left of media. In this shopping center I bought new blue skirt.After that we went our favorite art-cafe.We like it because cafe has beautiful design and tasty food .After that we went to walk on embankment.It is all our plan.Hope to hear from you soon! First of all,friends are important for us,we want a friend that we can share our secrets and problems.But friends maybe in the future go away or hurt you!So you can't always based on them!For example,they need you until they find someone better than you and in the end they go away.But family never let you go or family never go away from you! Our country was built on free speech, and now it is being taken away. finally ,a public transport need more costs , because public transport (such a buses , train ) fees every year is increasing, and this problem we do not face it by private transport , Censorship ensures that no opinions will be heard, that no one's beliefs will be questioned, that no one can assume or think for themselves. Is this not what we are supposedly guaranteed by freedom of speech? We are supposed to be able to say anything we want to say. We know there are consequences for saying certain things, but we are supposed to be allowed to say them. Suddenly we heard the sound of running footsteps.Then there was a cry and the footsteps stopped.Nervously,we walked back.Perhaps someone had been killed,or kidnapped in the street We were going to see what happened ,and we had something to see.There was one old granny who was beat up.We try to gave her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that.Than we were trying to find help ,but nobody was opening doors.On our luck I had a mobile phone ,but Michael was saying that we need to escape because we did not know are those bullies near the corner.My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I've done that. There are many sports grounds for example tennis cort,football grounds and play equipment for child so I think my town takes care of environment that makes everyone will be able to best condition in both mind and body long time. We are able to see our world through different eyes when we hear or read someone else's opinions. People's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years ,Equipment and tools have evolved since the beginning of human history.In recent decades,however, developments have been particularly groundbreaking,Man has been able to invent machines ,which they have been put to work automation is  a great help to mankind,because it significantly increases the standard of living and frees people form hard work.The result is much less work and a better life. But censorship wants to take this all away from us in order to please everyone. One of the example is television, in the past we use it only for watching news and movie, but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t, now television has others function. Playing the cricket will also gives physical exercise to our body.we can bowl,batt,field in the cricket which  requires lot of  physical activities. Censorship is trying to shield us from the ugliness of this world. But today, Things are getting change and technology marked a significant role in our life, Automobile segment increased its vertical and having a car becomes a need from luxory. We don't want our children to understand the atrocities that happen in everyday life. Travelling by car is convenient but there are dis advantage as well.As our population growing fast in a family both husband and wife working and children at university able to drive, so you are looking per house least 3 cars, so imagine how busy our roads will be.As now fuel price coming down that does not mean that it will stay like that for ever, price go up and down. However, if we don't allow people to open these doors, they can never understand the world or be prepared for the experiences that are to come. ?XD)Cherry blossom is very beautiful but there are so many people.When we went to Sun Moon Lake by cable car,wind is so strong!I felt a little nervous though the scenery amazing.All in all,I stil have a memorable vacation. For example, let's look at the issue of rape. In case of transportation technology, in this twenty first century we have various option like Plan that can fly with the cloud, train that fast and big enough that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time. So,my favourite sport in the present time it is street workout.I have been exercising this sport already long time.I like to exercise on the street even in the season when the temperature outside below zero.Of course, in summer I like to exercise more than in winter but this don't stop me.I don't know myself why,but I almost every day go on the street in order to exercise.If  It is very coldly and windily outside,I don't worry about it and I'm exsercising at home.For those people, who want to start to exercise the street workout I'm advising to start with basic exerscises such as pull ups,push ups,dips and squats.That everything basic exercises and they will help you will do a good start up.After some time when you will be feeling that you are ready for more, you can start to study more difficult exercises. To begin with is design,we are able to considerate backgroud colour ,artwork,and security issues,and then,we are supposed to preparing mental plates,such as skilled and machinists. Secondly,Closed trash bins provided to the people in order to collect the waste and recycling.People come forward and utilising this bin effectively instead of throwing away.As a result of this town looks clean compare to previous decades. Other reason for my opinión is that almost all the people preffer use the visual sense and ear to other person more than write and listen for understand new things. That doesn't get rid of rape. It still exists. And if the people are uneducated on the issue of rape, how will it ever stop? How will a rape ever be able to be prevented? That I want to say, is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb's in Spanish Languaje, just Imaging you the same but not in your native lenguaje. when i ran with the ball, i feel that i hold a goal or a valuable something and i should offer my best to put it in his place and make it in right way  . Sara stood and stared  here for a few minuets and hug here and bowed here for coming  and thanks here they hadn't meet for several years after they have finished their study .Really  it was great moment and stay speaking together about many things and call the best moment that collect them together , stay speaking until the evening .and agreed to visit their collage at the weekend to recall the best memories , peter who is arranged this celebration and connected with Tia and prepared for all this happen Sara never forget that day . Not only are they well-known for its long tradition but it also famous for the hospitality of inhabitants living here which attract domestics and foreign tourists come here to see the famous sights as well as shopping for souvenirs.They are closely located the local art gallery which take about 15 minutes to go by foot. Censorship is supposed to protect the people, but it doesn't. Nowadays, the transportation become more prefect,and the people'life become more convenient.Althought this change lend the life of people efficient,the problem should not be ignored.It would really be helpful if the government make tighter resrictions,in today's world ,lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission, they are destroyed the forest,farmland and wetland,charging waster water and emitting greenhouse gas,it lead to a serious enviorment problem.So the government should oversee this companies ,and if companies do not obey the rules or laws ,it will be fined and closed. MOTASSEM is a tall guy about 175 c.m and his Weight is 71 k.g and  has a wight skin  .He love going to the beach and he love swimming .He is a casual clothes wearing such Shirt and jeans which mostly  blue,Gray and Black .If you see him you notice how he is an elegant . We live off of knowledge. And the way we obtain this knowledge is through media. Censorship takes away pieces of knowledge gradually. It @MONTH1 not seem like a lot is missing now, but as time goes on the gap will increase, and more knowledge will be taken from our grasp. Is this fair? Is this right? my favorite sport is swimming i swim 2 times per a week sometimes i go to the swimming pool in the same area which i work there and sometimes i go to the swimming pool of my cousin, i enjoy when i spend my time in the water and now even i am pregnant i am afraid when i swim with a group of people i keep telling them and screaming do not close with me ! How does cutting out knowledge ever help? other people prefer to travel by trains as it's faster and more comfortable than cars.Many countries like to travel by bikes in order to decrease the pollution which happened by car exhausted.to my point of view i prefer travelling by cars which is more comfortable. My town is very beautiful and I like it very much because it is not any dirty streets in it  The governor of my city seek to develop it and he said it will be the capital of delta actually after 30 years ago the people in my town deal with rubbish by healthy method , the citizens collecting the rubbish and threw it in big boxes far away the city. The more that becomes unknown, the more we have to fear. This is due to Lima in the beginning  has not had a pant to desing its public road s and highways, and it only has been improvising to build their way without any criteria to transport its population. !hhhh sometimes is funny but my husband he takes cars of me he doesn't allow to anyone to be much closer with me, my mother in law she likes swimming too  last night we went to the swimming pool it was a little bit cold but we liked so we went to the pool and srated to swimming i know how to swim very well but she doesn't she has to have a support otherwise she cant. It is unfair, if nothing else. Yes,I think it also can educate.As times go by,technology is rapidly improving.More and more gadgets are invented such as televisions,smartphones and so on.There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly.Using will not only gain the entertainment but also get the knowledge.For instance,there are numerous program that we can choose.It is a good time to turn to the entertaining program,when we feel bored and gaze the wall all the day.Television provides educated varieties of channels as well.Discovery channel is posture-oriented model example to educate.We can learn how do the different animals feed on themselves.Above the statements can ensure a rich and abundant live. No good comes from hiding it. However, I have no agree with this statement because the public transport is needed for someone who are no have vehicle or economic downturn. And as time goes on it can only get worse. Censorship is based off of offensiveness. Also in the sort way, we should go walking to the destination.icle If we are working with  sameone in the same jobs, and  who lives near or he is our neighbour, we can go to the work in the same car, this way we use less oil. However, everything that exists in society could be offensive to someone. We can really confirm that there is no future for public transport, if so, we will have to drive a car instead of buying a ticket for public transport and go to office, city, home and so on using private transport, however we can also think that in the centre has no parking car or it is not enough for the whole private car, thereby, if we use a public transport, we can simplify our lives and spend less simply because we are able to save money and time. This means all media of any kind should be destroyed. I love my small family.My family members are very helpful and supportive.My parents are very support.My parents are my best friends and guides.If any problems faced ,i'm went to my parents and say the problem,there are solve the problem.My family is my world.My parents are the good guides.There are my role model.some times we were go to the tour programs,it's very happy moments.My mammy told the story in night.Mom make the special foods in festivals. First, you should know is the weather, we have a very cold winter and a hot summer compared with the other countries in the middle east.If you want a city with sea you should choose any city in the west or east of Saudi Arabia.Riyadh is the capital City it's in the center of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.All the stores and malls are closed at mid night include the five prays breaks because we need to go for pray for work you need to know what the major you want to work in so I can help you to search for a good job matching you abilities. Spanih´s food is fantastic, althouh there are a lot of restaurant for eat you and i think that the food is more expensive than your country.If you don´t like spanish´s food you can go restaurant the other country, but i know you love it. Chaos would ensue. But, on the other hand, because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable; cars are so many; very noisy, unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth. The freedom to know would vaporize right in front of their eyes. I think my town really take care of the environment,because there are a lot of parkｓ in this town and these are very clean.However　some people are not care of environment　that mean some people throw garbage away in the park.I think almost everyone loves parks because a lot of people go to the park and having　lunch,picnic,excersise,nap etc.I think after eat something at the park then clean themselves is good. We cannot allow our lives to be taken over by censorship. Yes, people's feelings will be hurt, but we cannot rid our world of ideas and knowledge purely to spare feelings. These ideas and knowledge are too important to let censorship take away. Then ,preparation of mental plates and skilled machinists are the needments.Printing is the next step ,.Usually ,sheets of bank notes printed ,because there are some special require for the printing ,solour of both sides,special ink ,images slightly raised. It also tries to shield us from reality, but instead hurts us, ensuring that we will never understand our world and never be able to stop the very things that are being censored. I decided and went.It was strange because I never went to the sports.From the time I started going to karate.After one month my instructor told me that I will go to the competition.I was very worrying and nervous. All knowledge will be trashed and no one will be able to voice their opinions. A very dark future waits for us if censorship continues. Only by helping people to understand censorship and the wrong it does to society can we gain back our freedom of speech; the freedom we are supposedly guaranteed, but censorship is desperately trying to take away."	2
209	"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"We have Eather first than people thanour house.Eather is our home,we all have to protect it.But now people are distroy it.Just for mony for more house but if we destroy it we will all die our money will gone our house will gone we will have nothing.Beside some people destroy farland to build houses but if one day there is no farmland than what should we eat?Nothing at that time we can eat nothing!So what should we do? But she is boyfriend live upstate and hasn’t got a airport he’s of city because of that she was need choose by train. It @MONTH1 be at the nearest playground bouncing on the teeter-totter. It @MONTH1 be at an elegant restaurant sitting at a petite table in the distant corner. This perspective of life is inspired by contracultural movements and some people call to these people as “alternative”, but it is each day more common and it let a inclusive and diverse society. I stumbled through the doorway carrying @CAPS11 purple backpack and @CAPS11 lunch pale resting in @CAPS11 left hand. I recognized everyone from @CAPS11 previous years of elementary school, and shortly joined them after visiting @CAPS11 hook outside the door. I had been waiting anxiously for @CAPS11 turn at the fifth grade. The legendary @PERSON1, was known as the ""coolest"" teacher around. ""As you well know, rose's life is your hands"" she said and keep talking:""...You are the only one, that can save her life, but before you must comply with your promise"". while we are spendind good time watching TV our brain is not in calm, only in an other position different to that ones in the rest od the day.That's why I think that it's a good momento to see the thing through a new glass and that can be a very high opportunity. announced @PERSON1 @CAPS3 with a contagious smile. The future of public transport in developed countries is very different, because most people have a car, in   the people who live in poor countries, most people take public transport, because people doesn´t have a car and is cheaper take public transport, the pollution of public transport is huge and is growing third world countries should have, eco friendly transport. Everyone listened attentively to @PERSON1's introduction to the year. His voice caught our full attention, but not too exciting compared to our expectations. He appeared very nice as most teachers come, but still nothing spectacular. The day dragged on. However, I have no agree with this statement because the public transport is needed for someone who are no have vehicle or economic downturn. television entertains as well as it will educate the people.These days are educating themselves by watching the television.Televison not only provide entertainment it will give lots of information about the happenings around the globe.Channels like national geographic and animal planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origination of species.Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people The next day rose quickly and I trudged back to the disappointing classroom. To @CAPS11 surprise, the next day was nothing like the first. So,my favourite sport in the present time it is street workout.I have been exercising this sport already long time.I like to exercise on the street even in the season when the temperature outside below zero.Of course, in summer I like to exercise more than in winter but this don't stop me.I don't know myself why,but I almost every day go on the street in order to exercise.If  It is very coldly and windily outside,I don't worry about it and I'm exsercising at home.For those people, who want to start to exercise the street workout I'm advising to start with basic exerscises such as pull ups,push ups,dips and squats.That everything basic exercises and they will help you will do a good start up.After some time when you will be feeling that you are ready for more, you can start to study more difficult exercises. Every wall was filled with endless color. Posters layered over the plain paint with fascinating pictures and words. However, I have no agree with this statement because the public transport is needed for someone who are no have vehicle or economic downturn. Fresh popcorn overflowed from inside. But in some country, You can use underground (metro) , it is very advanced than old types like Bus or Taxi,The underground is faster and clean and arranged . Mr. @CAPS3 sat contently at his broad desk as we made our way to our seats once again. Another ones which were bad sheets and bad bank notes from damaged apparently,would be destroyed securely.This was the whole working process of the bank notes and it was consist of 7 steps. After the first couple minutes of class I had found that the rumors were true. He had a sense of simple humor that created giggles in every corner of the class. His ideas and word choice related to us as @NUM1 graders. We found his subtle jokes quite amusing to our young minds. In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life, but majority of ones is totally utopic. As Automotive Industries are huge in market, most of the  house holders  prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time . Laughter hung over our heads like a heavy @CAPS1, never continuing along. We can really confirm that there is no future for public transport, if so, we will have to drive a car instead of buying a ticket for public transport and go to office, city, home and so on using private transport, however we can also think that in the centre has no parking car or it is not enough for the whole private car, thereby, if we use a public transport, we can simplify our lives and spend less simply because we are able to save money and time. We the management of The Arch London Hotel received your mail and wishes to let you know that you should make known to us the position you desired to work in via return mail along with a scan copy of your signed contract of agreement to enable us make every necessary corrections.Thank you. Another good option is give them a difficult work for every day keep them busy, but I don't know what kind of job can be, because a person who commit a crime isn´t going to do something to help society like communitarian service. Despite the everlasting fun and games, @PERSON1 showed us what it was really like to be a learner. He cared about our future and pushed us to strive in every moment of life. He taught us to write with desire and worth. To express our feelings on paper and tell the world a story that we want heard. He would plan one on one time with students struggling in a particular subject, and next class their confidence had bloomed. I have joined football-teams which is near to my home, I prefer to this team because of my family is not reach, they can not provide for my transportation fees to go exercises stadium. I'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant its name is ""Lemon"" I go there every week it has different food from any restaurants I'd like chicken crispy with garlic sauce It's Excellent choice for me and My favorite appitizer is susage and in order that desert I'd rather ""Vadge"" cake with chocolate sauce I feel I;m at ease when I go there I enjoy  classical music over having a lunch about the service It's very good and all staff are respectable I can't imagine one week without going there that drives me nuts I advise any one to go there and enjoy  a time there , also this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really It's  excellent This strikingly thing for anyone  despite all of these advantages prices are not expensive . @PERSON1 gave us a craving to learn. @DATE1 @TIME1, I had began to walk home, when @PERSON1 @CAPS3 stopped me at the door. Abortion is an immoral act that people make as everyone has a chance to survive and nobody has the right to decide for anyone life.Abortion has to be taken seriously in order to avoid these immoral action as these fetus are being deprive of their right since they have already a life.People had to be sensitize about abortion in order to decrease the number of women being abort.Furthermore,abortion is very dangerous and a great number of women had been death with this.Children has to be protected before and after life,it is why abortion has to be stop To sum up, do sports is very important for teenagers to which the body is going to grow and do it regularly is commitment that we should take. subsequently,this step is most important.bank note should be inspected.bank notes separated into good and bad if get good quality sheets,the next stage is packaging and distribution.at this stage sheets should be cut into separate bank notes,packed,and dispatched. Already public transport have been improvement and that makes comfortable to go on a trip,but I think that will be able to become good quality more and more,because so many people expectation. ""I'm glad"" he continued, then changing the subject, ""I was thinking about having a huge dodge ball tournament at recess tomorrow. Do @CAPS10 think that would be a good idea?"" I snickered to myself, trying to comprehend the fact that an adult had said this to me, ""That would be so fun."" the development technology and Industry very fast , so the public transport no future , Must be Interesting the development transport Even fits the times. One of the example is television, in the past we use it only for watching news and movie, but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t, now television has others function. @CAPS11 face lit up. Firstly it is clear that more house and transport networks is convenient for our people,what is knowed to us is that the population growth is a big problems,which is needed for more palce to living.And builing more transport networks is also benifit for us,for example ,the high-speed rail can be shorteded our time in traveling.while the animal may not welcome to it, we all know that do sport is very important to keep our life healthy and happy.My favourite sport actually is walking;and I prefer walking in the morning and before sundown.I like also walking in public street,gardens,clubs and on the shore.when i want to go anywhere;I do my best to go on foot.I like this sport since my childhood because I found that I can think about my good time when I was child and relax with myself to think carefully about my present and future.The walking can also fitness and do the knee stronger.It would be interesting to accompain your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time.I advice my guys who suffer from laziness and overweight,try to walk one hour at least and after that they will like this sport. I can tell you that I fell I can understand over 90% when I'm listening and when I´m Reading, but my main problem with English is of course when I must speak: I fell my self horrible without confidence, I think that always I'm thinking in Epanish and after makind the translation to English, may be in this moment when I'm writing this composition I'm making the same wrong. Nevertheless travel by car is easier for commute for example, because they can choose a personal timetable without a terrible discomfort of buses; in addiction there is a fair chance that by the end of this century dwellers will stop travelling by public transport, in special way if the government have invested his money in green energy and we could discover a new green car, which in turn revolutionary our life. Gradually, from time to time, I drift back to the careless days of @NUM1 grade and @PERSON2 I still laugh at the ridiculous events that occurred in that small classroom each and every day. We can really confirm that there is no future for public transport, if so, we will have to drive a car instead of buying a ticket for public transport and go to office, city, home and so on using private transport, however we can also think that in the centre has no parking car or it is not enough for the whole private car, thereby, if we use a public transport, we can simplify our lives and spend less simply because we are able to save money and time. Laughter has left a mark on me, and those kids of @CAPS11 @NUM1 grade class."	2

However if this situation not change and if our government not take providence about this important subject will be the end of the transport public and will more convenient to use car. You should knew about the prize for coming to the museum is very cheap ($15.00) for hour if you want to stay more time the prize increase in $10.00. hello  my name is Mustafa I am 23 years old and I am Student in collage I search for job but I don't find a job I wish that my country become a great country and better and I wish to married who I love her  thank you Personally I believe that those who are not participate any activity the teachers has them to encourage .Then only they also know how talented they are.Every student should attend and show their talent.After some ages we can not attend any this type of activity because we all are become old .So let do and enjoy your young age be happier. MEASURES IN FAVOUR OF TAKING CARE THE ENVIRONMENT The council is carrying out a project in order to erradicate the rubbish in my town.This project is focused on separating the rubbish in each green points of the city and also they have to maintain their neighbourhood as clear as are possible. I have had a few disturbing experiences myself. One time when I was a young lad, I checked out a horror movie from the local library not knowing what the movie was about. The son of Lucy and her husband one day he went to caved holes in the dirt for make a game, he make five holes and in the last one he found a brilliant jewelry that had been generations of gods so he started throwing that for play, one time that he take the jewelry, it consume the mind of the little guy and that cause that the jewelry liberated some sounds that only giants can hear so a mountain stand up that was the face of a giant and he perceive negative waves so he kill the guy because he had the most important relic of the gods. Good day, My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport, Volleyball one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to practise  this sport 3 times a week since 1980,  the reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as follows : 1- make me fit and healthy  2- classy game no friction between players  3- it exercise all muscles of your body Regarding the above I advice all rookies to start practise this sport and they will get many benefits. The images from the film stayed in my head for a good month. Children do not deserve the feeling of fear for that long of a time. Next, some material in the library contain certain things that offend random people. Large public libraries contain music with explicit lyrics. When I was returning from syleth I called the girl and talk to her and assure that I got chance in university but girl says that she knew it. In addition to that, this music offends many adults as well. Adults agree that there is no reason for any rap to be released in a public place like a library. Does why, is easy to believe that if things continue with this rhythm and transforming everything, in a closer future of 50 years everything is gonna be completely knew and different. I have observed that children listening to rap at a very young age are more likely to end up turning out to be an unsuccessful individual. he said kindly:""I buy you a present,open it,Tom"" Tom opened the big bag,Oh!This is a big surprise,there was a football in it,which he always wanted to buy there were some words goal!keep doing! Personally I believe that those who are not participate any activity the teachers has them to encourage .Then only they also know how talented they are.Every student should attend and show their talent.After some ages we can not attend any this type of activity because we all are become old .So let do and enjoy your young age be happier. Images like blood can sometimes offend the people of our generation. In addition, my major is English so teachers will teach and explain by English, which I can’t catch up on lessons well in the first time. If offensive material was banned from libraries, our society would have eliminated one more problem that is taking away from our good world. Nowadays, public transport is used for many people in the cities, we can find different types of them, such as bus tube and train, but is there a future for it or not?, I am going to respond this question giving disadvantanges and advantages and  finally I give my personal opinion. Someday when I have kids, I will never let them go to certain sections of the library with this material. From the beginning of the world till now , human wants the fast income and the easy ways of live , so he tries more and more to find a solution for  his problems by creating a new ways of liveing more easy and more convenient  for him. Travelling by car is convenient but there are dis advantage as well.As our population growing fast in a family both husband and wife working and children at university able to drive, so you are looking per house least 3 cars, so imagine how busy our roads will be.As now fuel price coming down that does not mean that it will stay like that for ever, price go up and down. Most of the adults that want their children to be successful and have a good, creative mind will think twice about going to the library without censorship of certain items. I have read that libraries with bad material are much less likely to attract customers than libraries with censorship. while we are spendind good time watching TV our brain is not in calm, only in an other position different to that ones in the rest od the day.That's why I think that it's a good momento to see the thing through a new glass and that can be a very high opportunity. I think in the future don't exist public transport because we will drive their car.When you drive your own transport ,a car for example, you going to from a specificlly place but in a bus you go to the bus stop and no to your house or school, work... It is better from the people be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person. Censorship is as necessary to libraries as flavor is to food. Shelves that contain inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only make their number of customers drop. If you think that this is only going to help libraries, I dare you to go ahead and try it out. Everyone has their own opinions, but I am a firm believer in censorship at public and private libraries. In this shopping center I bought new blue skirt.After that we went our favorite art-cafe.We like it because cafe has beautiful design and tasty food .After that we went to walk on embankment.It is all our plan.Hope to hear from you soon! A library is a great place to be, but the libraries without censorship are an utter disappointment. After all, it is your life, and you get to choose the way you want your children to act. Disturbing materials are only going to bring a negative effect on these minors. I hope to see the amount of censorship rise in libraries. If it does, people will see a dramatic change in all of my ideas discussed."	2
211	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"I do not agree about smoking on campus Nonsmokers are more than smokers in campus So smokers damage to nonsmokers about health And because Smoking is bad for health, for their health, must quit smoking. I had truancy and did not pay attention to studies.That really the biggest harm to a hard-working woman whom my mother tried all her best to feed me up and help me complete my studies.All the members of my family never give me up,and I finished my college studies ,too .I have a good job now.I do really thank my mother and all the members for paying the patient and exertion to me .Now we have  great relationship with each other and treasure the happiness  we get not so easy.So,are the members of my family my best friends？I'll answer you ：there's not much better answer than Yes！ now days young people are influence towards the western culture so,they are getting more fashionable.youngster are interested to wear different stylish and colored clothes.they are happy with wearing different color clothes.they didn't want to wear our cultural dress such as sari,dhoti,choli and many more.they only like to wear shirt,pant skirt,t shirt and many more.youngster are influence by watching different programmes on  television. No matter what year, its lowest level always in Jan-Mar.May be because this paragraph of time the weather was cold, the purchaser greatly reduced.We can be seen from the diagram,  the highest peak in the has increased year by year, as the low as. Thirdly,Public toilets has been opened for the public to elminate attitude of urinating in the public places.Town council not only encourage people to planting or garndening,it subsidise money for their green improvements.Example,free fertilizers,water pump failitiesand pesticides. Stress? Peer pressure? Michael went into the teacher office,but he found that his teacher isn't here,maybe teacher went to the bathroom,suddenly,the door is opened by teacher,a teacher who wore bikini came into sight,this incident came as quite a surprise to Michael,she flirted with Michael,Michael felt excited but run out of the office,but he had regret for his action,Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Tobacco contains nicotine, a drug that is addictive. Once you start smoking, it is very hard, but not impossible to quit. We can really confirm that there is no future for public transport, if so, we will have to drive a car instead of buying a ticket for public transport and go to office, city, home and so on using private transport, however we can also think that in the centre has no parking car or it is not enough for the whole private car, thereby, if we use a public transport, we can simplify our lives and spend less simply because we are able to save money and time. one day Micheal wanted to go out from his home so he called his besfriend an suggested to go out togther , his friend agreed , so Michael weared his closes , wnet out and closed the door but at this moment he knew he had made a mistake . That was me, I never liked studying, I never found myself in those subjects, but it wasn't the big deal to me, I hated is being seen as unsuccessful or a loser, as I wasn't that, I knew that I'm clever enough to study all these subjects and do well in exams so I can get high marks but they're all didn't get that, they judged me for my marks but marks don't form brains or thoughts, marks isn't the only way that makes you great now and then in the future. we bocome not only older but also wiser .we learn but the most useful thing to learn is to get in alot of experiences & for sure to make mistakes .but we have to be honest with our selves by admitting our mistakes to avoid them in the future . As a college student, I have seen firsthand the prevalence of smoking. other people prefer to travel by trains as it's faster and more comfortable than cars.Many countries like to travel by bikes in order to decrease the pollution which happened by car exhausted.to my point of view i prefer travelling by cars which is more comfortable. In a campus survey I conducted of 15 college students in February 2002, eight students said they were current smokers. I surveyed eight males and seven females. My survey included 18 questions revealing gender, age, class, familial history of smoking, frequency of smoking, desire to quit, methods used to quit, awareness of hazards, etc. I surveyed several of my classmates in class, a few sorority sisters in our suite, and random students at the HUB."	2

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear Newspaper, I am writing this better to explain to you how more people in our society would benefit from using computer you can do work in less time it would take to do it manualy. You can interact and make more friends by talking or web chating. Not to forget that it is more entertaning. For some reasons, I really liked to play basketball, first, playing basketball can train my muscle and make the body more healthier ; the second, my classmates and I all know how to win a game through the basketball game because the basketball game is a teamwork. To help us with tasks or for our personal use. FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY´S all begins in 1981 when freddy fazbear's pizza open, the establishment it's a pizza restaurant but this pizza restaurant in had robots, in 1981 there were four animatronics and their names are Chica , Foxy, Bonnie and Freddy. Lets say that you are having a buisness meeting and you have to write a five page report with pictures and a graphs. First I will ask a question to you if this is your own house,you buy it with a lot of money and will you broke it with no reason? But in some day tow guise with quad bike and they saw some thing wrong they sad what's that , they sow dead body , they skared and run to ther camp . With graph making software, you can easily plug in the data you have collected and the computer will do the rest. my favourite sport is swimming , it makes me feeling comfortable and left me in a good mood , i go to swim twice a week , and my advice to anyone want to start to enjoy every moment of it Some people say that a tripp by car is more convenient that by the public transportation, but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations.It is true that travel to a nearby place from your city, it  is more comfortable getting there by car, and the ease of have your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time paying  cabs. Then the engineers call to other sector to ensure the doubt of Atlantis then the professional say that other was correct. For other hand, People make other inventions for improving the world and reduce pollution, for example, In this time we have created electric cars or organic food, these things are very useful in future, because we will need to reduce pollution. With a computer you can easily talk to a friend as to having to write a letter or talk on the phone with a computer you can either chat with a person with writing or even being able to see them on you computer screen. looking at the information in more detail.Initially,bank note should be considered the design such as background colour ,artwork,and security issues.then,the preparation of metal plates is next stage.bank note should be skilled and machinists.thereafter,this stage is printing .worker should pay attention to colour on both sides,special ink , and images slightly raised. Our Mistakes mistake made us better than before if in life we had't got any mistake  we wouldn't succeed that's why  the mistakes are very important in life and I believe  our mistake improve us so but in another way there just one mistake and you could not come back or arranged your mistake Being able to see the person at your convinience to talk without having to leave you house is a very good thing to have. The benifit are major and it doesn't cost anything to chat. So if you want to work in Egypt you must have a complete information about the job (location ,salary,incentives, Allowances , work environment,position titles , company type,policy ,mission,vision)                                                                                               With best Wishes                                                                                                Sameh Sabbagh What about entertainment? The computer is a very valuable too! but we can fun, we can play games or watch videos at as convinience. They don't cost a lot to download at all, they can be played with friends on a web chat or by yourself. television entertains as well as it will educate the people.These days are educating themselves by watching the television.Televison not only provide entertainment it will give lots of information about the happenings around the globe.Channels like national geographic and animal planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origination of species.Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people I used to live for a short time in a place where word recycle was completely ignored but they used to this because that wasn't so rich. Playing games were ever you go is good and again don't art to play or. looking at the information in more detail.Initially,bank note should be considered the design such as background colour ,artwork,and security issues.then,the preparation of metal plates is next stage.bank note should be skilled and machinists.thereafter,this stage is printing .worker should pay attention to colour on both sides,special ink , and images slightly raised.

213	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I think it is fact that everyone agree with that KAIST is great university at many point of views. However, it is also fact that we cannot satisfied with this university at all of the points. IN my country peole do alot of mistake and have alot of of bad habits concerning their attitude towards the rubbish ,they are always throwing their old things and rubbish in public place ,the governement also cannot do their role towards their people and their bad behaviour Among them, I would change something about cafeterias in KAIST. First of all, all of the cafeterias in KASIT are far away from the Mir building which I'm living in. Nowadays, public transport is used for many people in the cities, we can find different types of them, such as bus tube and train, but is there a future for it or not?, I am going to respond this question giving disadvantanges and advantages and  finally I give my personal opinion. It means if I want to eat meal inside of KAIST, I have to use 20minutes to walk. Because of this, many students in Mir building often pass the meal, and this fact may affect on students' health. That I want to say, is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb's in Spanish Languaje, just Imaging you the same but not in your native lenguaje. Then the engineers call to other sector to ensure the doubt of Atlantis then the professional say that other was correct. However the best option is that you came here and after I present my friends and their fathers because they can help with your job. Negaticvs about the online lerning are dat your not listening to much from ea real person and more from a Computer, if you dont have any listening things in the app you dont lern how to pronounce the words. They are at least 6000won. To summarize, our present cafeterias in KAIST are quite difficult to go there and expensive. These facts affect students bad. Based on these reasons I want to change our university's cafeteria if I can."	2

"Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. It teaches hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Computers are one of the best technology invention yet to come that benefits society. First off, computers teach hand-eye coordination. My studies in tecnologico de Monterrey are demanding and challenging because it has a very high educative score all worldwide, but also has to many good things, for example we have a lot of interchanges all around the world, when you have the opportunity to do an interchange you have to deal with the language and the culture with the other country, that means you have to be responsible for studying the basics things of that country, but all of this is worthwhile because when you are there you have so much fun. finally ,a public transport need more costs , because public transport (such a buses , train ) fees every year is increasing, and this problem we do not face it by private transport , However, if would be a lot more trouble if you didn't have any knowledge about computers are where the helpful keys are. This sport cause fresh and jolly me and I think will exercise cause healthy.if you start volleyball, you need a ball and piece of ground that separate with tie. If somebody wanted to take a nice, relaxing vacation/honeymoon with their beautiful wife they would need to know the weather forecast so they would know what clothes to bring, and how much money they need to bring to visit all the luscious, freshest restaurants, hottest stores in this enormous populated city. Without a doubt, I would love to take a vacation, but if it's going to cost a fortune I might have to re-consider this amazing trip. Lastly, you can talk online with other people. Not only are they well-known for its long tradition but it also famous for the hospitality of inhabitants living here which attract domestics and foreign tourists come here to see the famous sights as well as shopping for souvenirs.They are closely located the local art gallery which take about 15 minutes to go by foot. Now it's time to decide! But she is boyfriend live upstate and hasn’t got a airport he’s of city because of that she was need choose by train. In my opinion computers are great for society and we should keep having them around because they teach hand-eye coordination, and give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Yes,I think it also can educate.As times go by,technology is rapidly improving.More and more gadgets are invented such as televisions,smartphones and so on.There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly.Using will not only gain the entertainment but also get the knowledge.For instance,there are numerous program that we can choose.It is a good time to turn to the entertaining program,when we feel bored and gaze the wall all the day.Television provides educated varieties of channels as well.Discovery channel is posture-oriented model example to educate.We can learn how do the different animals feed on themselves.Above the statements can ensure a rich and abundant live. This is certainly a great form of technology people should have."	2
215	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"when I find me in London, I'm going to the buckingham palace located in the city of westminster and I'll see your art gallery and tourist attraction of the British monarchy continue in London, I will visit to the largest parks in London, the hyde park that having a full day of guided outdoor games and activities for perservation thereof park follow in London I'll go for a walk to arrive at the big ben that is the most beautiful bullding in all its splendour when I will take pictures later, I'll take the underground of London that is a public fast transit system, I'm trawiling in it when I'll leave of the underground in the station wembley park I going to the wembley stadium where I will enjoy an evening of football, the match started at 8:00pm Some universities insist that the students have to expand their knowledge by learning and integrating various fields. However, in my opinion, specializing in one subject have several fascinating advantages for students. The first reason is that students can save their time to study. other people prefer to travel by trains as it's faster and more comfortable than cars.Many countries like to travel by bikes in order to decrease the pollution which happened by car exhausted.to my point of view i prefer travelling by cars which is more comfortable. For example, in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, my major, lots of information have to be studied to familiarize with concepts, memorize formulas, and solve various application problems. Students in this major need enough time to study through all these processes. If students study deeply in their one subject, students will be able to become experts by practicing and learning enough about their major. In addition to saving study time, students can get less stress from studying. When students take lots of subjects, assignments and tests in various fields increase; in addition, these tasks and exams differ in the conditions required to complete the subject, such as enough time for coding in computer engineering and the ability to solve various problems in mathematics. To achieve these subjects with different personalities, students need a lot of effort and talent; as a result, the stress that students receive increases. Therefore, it is very stressful for students to accomplish various subjects at the same time. Yesterday ,I had a wonderful day  .In the morning I went to a Galician basketball training with a coach of Spanish selection ,when  finished went to my parents to a hotel to eat and stay with some friends , after the food meet with  friend´s of my parents and went to a theme park and we rode to a rollers coaster, it was very exciting and we ate a chocolate ice cream, it was delicious .At night we went to a match  of Spanish basketball league, Obradoiro versus Real Madrid and that match won the team of Real Madrid and then I went home to sleep. Besides, they argue that students can find and enjoy their true interests by taking a variety of subjects. it can never be regained even the strongest monarchs have been helpless to prevent time.So should be careful about the importance of time .I hope to not waste it and use it as the best use for giving opportunity for rising .Those who waste it ,will be behind and they will fail to make a mark in their life.The great men and successful guys became fame and rose by a suitable use for time .They guide and source of inspiration for a new generation. the most family member I love and think she is the best friend of mine , my sister , she is elder me about 12 years , I can tell her any thing about my life , my self , my feelings ,hhh also i think if i felt in love she would be the first to know that . The people of my town try to plant plants in the centre or somewhere is too smoke, so they try to keep the air at recommended levels.on the morning a lot of people go on footto the work or to the school or ride a bike or they take the bus.The people try to move the local factories out of country where is less air polluted ,less smoke,less cars and more forests and plants. we can see that there are lots of serious and frequently weather disaster happened in decades, such as typhoon, hurricane, wild fire and mud slide."	2
216	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Smoking has been a serious problem for too long a period. Some people say that a tripp by car is more convenient that by the public transportation, but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations.It is true that travel to a nearby place from your city, it  is more comfortable getting there by car, and the ease of have your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time paying  cabs. I used my car every day however few a few I started to take public transport for I can to save up money What has been taken into consideration in this rule is first and foremost the health of people. Smoking has been criticized for decades. I have to start saying that I never imagine swimming like my favorite sport, because until my back´s injury, I practiced other sports, I most like extreme sports like downhill, skateboarding martial arts like Aikido, jiujitsu or ninjutsu, but for my injury I have to start swimming and now I love it. It gives the students the freedom to choose his major and the teachers.In addition, it has a lot of facilities that serve students like kindergarten that takes care of children these employees, university housing, hospital the student of medicine can be application in it and it serves the people too, and a big library has many books in various languages. Playing the cricket will also gives physical exercise to our body.we can bowl,batt,field in the cricket which  requires lot of  physical activities. FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY´S all begins in 1981 when freddy fazbear's pizza open, the establishment it's a pizza restaurant but this pizza restaurant in had robots, in 1981 there were four animatronics and their names are Chica , Foxy, Bonnie and Freddy. Therefore, when a person is enjoying his cigarette in restaurants, where people may not able to stay away the smoking immediately, s/he is putting the people around her/him into danger, including those who never lay their hands on the cigarette. So, it is reasonable to ban this behavior which is in no regard of other people. In the second place, the smog and smell produced by the cigarette may make people feel uncomfortable. Usually, a popular restaurant is crowded with people, which has already declined the quality of the atmosphere in these places. If the smog given out by cigarettes adds to it, many people can barely step enjoy their dishes. I know that I am a suitable person for this job, and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job, because I have been travelled for all the world and in this experience, I have seen in the necesity on work to fiance my journey, so the I have dedicated to work on summer camps, and I have a lot of experience in this. The sport is very importatnt of our body it has many benefits to emprove our selves and give us self confedant so we should practice any sport we love because it can change our mind to the better. It's definitely a catastrophe to me if I have to put up with the smog during my dinner. In conclusion, I'm fully convinced that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the countries."	2
217	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"I definitely agree with it. In fact, although it is hard to achieve, I hope that smoking can be completely banned at all public spaces someday. Although some people think smoking make them feel comfort and relax, the truth is, cigarettes still do hardly anything good but harm our health. And the most important of all, people should have the right to refuse to breathe in the second-hand smoke. I grew up in a parent family.Sometimes I felt that I was alone and not loved.However,we were lucky enough to have a great mother who tried  all her best to keep my older brother，my older sister and I for completing our college studies .Of course my uncle ,young brother of my mother gave a big hand to go through the hard,so that made us often help each other in my family when the member who was in hard.Especially I was the youngest member in the family ,made much more troubles when I was young . After all, if the whole restaurant is full of smoke, how do you enjoy the smell of food and taste it in good mood? the movie I´m going to be reviewing is ""the purge""  I actually loved it quite a lot, I just loved all the suspense and the parts they leave you hanging, it´s just way too interesting, the movie is about the american government who annually gives 12 hours where all crime, even murder, is legal, and there are no medical services during that long period of what they call ""the purge"" and anyone can join it, you can kill whoever you want. Moreover, it is obvious that smoke or breathe in the second-hand smoke harm our health. One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance,  homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society."	2

"They told her that her brother had a car accident first of all she shocked  Then she went quickly to the train station and she bought ticket to London when she was in the train she had other phone cell . Everyone eagerly waiting for the ambulance arrival but still not yet reached the reason is our college location is little far from the city that's why it is getting late. Computers teach hand-eye coordination and allow people to learn information from all over the world. Lastly, computers allow people to communicate through internet. Advances in technology improve society and the over all way of life around the globe. This afirmation: travelling by car is so much more convenient say everything, for example if we think a lot of time we spent on wait bus to arrive our destiny, the traffic is a lot of things that everyone prefer  buy car it more practical and fast. Computers show these advances greatly. In our earth, Hunderds of millions prople living in here.Except us, There are also a large number of wildlife. Typing skills are a great example. basketball needs that the person should be tall enough to play it .i like basketball because it makes me happy,fit,have self_confidence and makes me active .if anyone want to play basketball ,he should do many exercises and try to be able to play it because everything is difficult at first but we shouldn't give up . However if this situation not change and if our government not take providence about this important subject will be the end of the transport public and will more convenient to use car. On the rest of the boring week, I was watching TV and suddenly my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet, so I decided to solve my Paris puzzles with my sister, which was less than a half solved for about one year but it had too much color in the sky so I didn't finished then a year ago. as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! These advances in computers can also allow people to learn worldwide information. In those days almost 80% of people have assured feel preocupation about their bodies and their alimentation, for this they convidenced me that they will try improve their habitual alimentation everyday and their will do sport more frequently. It would be very hard to do that report without a computer. I think it would be important that, not only in the family, but also in the school could be grow a new generaion sensible to ecological problems of the earth.

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A regular day for a person, with a computer, includes at least three hours using the computer per day. There are some big shelves in center of market are divided to some different parts for kinds of goods like Dried fruit, nuts, flour, condiment, beans, grains, rice, etc. Just think about it, just sitting in a chair with your eyes gluded to the computer when you could be exercising, spending time with family and friends or enjoying nature? After all do we really need a computer? At first, I had called a travel agent but he said he couldn’t be able to book me a flight before two months, so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent. However, we can prevent it! We are certainly not helping this issue when we have childre. But we don't have forgotten the cotamination by cars, We can use more the bicycle or public transportetion. We are so fortonate, our town has at least two physical fitness buildings for anyone can attend instead of using the computer. My favorite way to travel is the Plane because  I like to be fast and in my life, I hate a wait in my opinion the plane is the best for me for example when you want to go  somewhere you need to reach there so quick , you don't need to take time and The plane is the best travelling in the world that the best safer than other way  , you can see on the pollution of people who got an accident , how often an accident happen by the plane so anyway if it's happen,i can't imagine it , Eventually I wish everyone who like to travel is safe and sound and safe journey. There are running program held at our local beach, @LOCATION1, where you can exercise or even run a small competition! For other hand, People make other inventions for improving the world and reduce pollution, for example, In this time we have created electric cars or organic food, these things are very useful in future, because we will need to reduce pollution. Teachers, parents, children writers everyone lets stay away from the computers and stay fit! We have Eather first than people thanour house.Eather is our home,we all have to protect it.But now people are distroy it.Just for mony for more house but if we destroy it we will all die our money will gone our house will gone we will have nothing.Beside some people destroy farland to build houses but if one day there is no farmland than what should we eat?Nothing at that time we can eat nothing!So what should we do? More and more people are making less effort to see people in person. I'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant its name is ""Lemon"" I go there every week it has different food from any restaurants I'd like chicken crispy with garlic sauce It's Excellent choice for me and My favorite appitizer is susage and in order that desert I'd rather ""Vadge"" cake with chocolate sauce I feel I;m at ease when I go there I enjoy  classical music over having a lunch about the service It's very good and all staff are respectable I can't imagine one week without going there that drives me nuts I advise any one to go there and enjoy  a time there , also this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really It's  excellent This strikingly thing for anyone  despite all of these advantages prices are not expensive . Ferrari making one of the fastes cars on the word, but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac, how they were in the past.If sameone like cars then should go to Formula 1 race to hear the bolid engine sound, I think that is the best voice which I have ever heard in my life.Formula 1 it is also  dangerous sport, the driver are exposed to the risk of  accident at high speed. Everybody needs to socialize face to face. George's restaurant is a very pleasant place with many tasteful recipes from all around the world to enjoy alone or with your company your dinner.The Head-chef is an experienced and skillful man in his work.The food ,his team of chefs,prepare is always magnificent and the decoration a piece of art ,not to mention that the decoration is fully engaged in the Head-chef .Not only the food but also the restaurant itself is a very beautiful destination . Instead of talking to people online we could be enjoying with those same people at an amusment park, a restaurant, at a park or simply in our barkyard/house. The world is so beautiful with so many places to see but society is too busy to see it because we're on computer for a long time. Our computers use up so much energy and is a threat to the world, @CAPS2 @CAPS3! At the end, the kind of live that we will see in fifty years from now will have a lot of stuff to help the people to have a more comfortable, easier and faster way of live, but this will be only to meke more money and consume more and more, also the things will be faster of waste to make the people to change their apparel more often and create a consumerism. On a computer you can see a magestic places like beaches but you can't interact with them. If we get off our computer we could be swimming at a beach or a pool! I think that any one wants to start sport can play squach which  gives stretched  and  healthy body,in the same time this sport can be played for a long time of period without caring about the age. @PERCENT1 of residents in @LOCATION1 own computers and spend a lot of thier day on it. We could be improving obesity, spending more time with family and friends, and exploring Nature! Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately.He had to buy a present for his girlfriend´s birthday but it was Sunday and all stores were closed so he had to found a solution.A few hours,he was walking by a garden,and suddenly,he saw the most beautiful flowers that he has ever seen,so he picked them up.However,flowers weren´t enough so he decided to think in anything else.Several hours later,he found an open sweet shop and he bought some bonbons for her.Finally,he had found the present and before the end of the day he ran quickly to his girlfriend's house.If you don't want to pass this situation,you must always do things with time."	2

"!hhhh sometimes is funny but my husband he takes cars of me he doesn't allow to anyone to be much closer with me, my mother in law she likes swimming too  last night we went to the swimming pool it was a little bit cold but we liked so we went to the pool and srated to swimming i know how to swim very well but she doesn't she has to have a support otherwise she cant. all my class called me creep ugly geek but still little good only when a teacher want from them a research or the exams are next couple days but Michael trying to stop me doing that because they never become my friends and i was bigger to do this things ;    that day i just finish help younger student to understand his  math lesson  My friend Michael asked me to do the same to give her answer sheet for all final exams i was in bi shook why she  want that from me  any way i collect my courage told her that was wrong and become to do that in college better to start study  now and I'll help her to study the hard lessons (i was very sad to say no & she asked me that)she become very angry and told me i should help her because we she was my best Friend then i told her that why i told her NO and she told me i hate you Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. One positive effect it has on people is that they can communicate. This perspective of life is inspired by contracultural movements and some people call to these people as “alternative”, but it is each day more common and it let a inclusive and diverse society. If someone doesn't have a phone or car, they can simply go online, write a message, and click the send button. This is an easy way to communicate with someone who lives half way around the world @CAPS2 well. If you have family members who live far away, you can also send them pictures of yourself, friends/family, and places you've been to. They can receive them and also send pictures back. Another positive effect computers have on people is that they can learn new things. The internet allows you search different topics and basically has everything and anything you could ever think of. If you go on @ORGANIZATION1 and type in a word like 'dog,' you'll see a bunch of websites that will take you to other websites that are just about dogs. ?XD)Cherry blossom is very beautiful but there are so many people.When we went to Sun Moon Lake by cable car,wind is so strong!I felt a little nervous though the scenery amazing.All in all,I stil have a memorable vacation. The internet lets you explore new things and help find ideas. You name it; they got it. The computer also cames in handy when you have nothing to do. Environmental changes really need in the current situation.People contribuation is very important in this matter.The report explains how my town people taking care of my surroundings and to preserve this planet in a betterway. Playing computer games can teach you techniques to help play a game better, @CAPS2 well @CAPS2 keep you busy. It is a time when children must choose, which people are good or bad, which way they will go to difficult situation for example they will be drink alcohol or they will have fun without any suplements. I went to a  awesome concert of points of view and I know that I look forward to telling you how it was.But let me tell you it was a concert that the  performed Lala Band and I have taken and I especially, I was the cameraman.It was an excellent night.The concert was evening began at 20:00 and came a lot of persoane. If you're also in the mood to write a story, you can open a word document or if you just want to type whats on your mind. @CAPS2 you can see, I think the computer is a facinating tool to use. When I want studying for exams  going to the living room and sitting front of TV In addition, there is a small blackboard for my littel brother because my mother wants my prother learn Arabic and English letters. Just remember, whenever you can, go out and play or hang out with friends and family."	2

"In the end, large colleges admit largest number of students, so the student may do establishing friendships more from different nationalities, also it serves the community by graduating many students in various majors. hello, i want the job for the summer camp i'm looking for children between 8-12 years old i will help to organise sports and evening activities and if you want i could work in the kitchen if i have the job write soon                                                                   victoria People should be exercising, and hanging out with friends and family, computers dont even teach you that much if you really think about it. MOTASSEM is a tall guy about 175 c.m and his Weight is 71 k.g and  has a wight skin  .He love going to the beach and he love swimming .He is a casual clothes wearing such Shirt and jeans which mostly  blue,Gray and Black .If you see him you notice how he is an elegant . But, the public transportation have a lot of future bacase a lot of reassons, first the time, if the place you want to reach finally is really far the different type of vehicles of public transportation will get you there faster than your car, also the complications about the field, like if you want to go from America to Europe there is no highway that cross the ocean you need an airplane and unless you have one, you will cannot reach travel between continents with your car, a different reasson is politics, because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska you will not need to pass through Canada, the commodity is a really important reasson because drive for 8 hours is exhausting and it will be unsafe also, the economics is a factor to, because the attrition of your car it will be more that in the normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do, it will be expensive that in public transportation. In this generation, more kids are overweight and obese that any other other generation. People get so caught up in what they are doing on the computer that they forget to exercise each day, or at least every other day. Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe, in fact there is some important tournament where participate all important Europe team,They are called ""Champions League"" and ""Europa League"".football is a team sport in fact in this sport participate everyboby without exclude nobody. People already spend way to much time watching t.v. It rots your brain and studies acually show that people are less aware and less connected to the world and the people around them. However the best option is that you came here and after I present my friends and their fathers because they can help with your job. FILM: LUCY (2014) TThe plot of this film is about a 25 naive woman that was living and studying in Taiwan and one night went out for clubbing and met a nutter guy that involved her in a seedy drug smuggling issue with a Corean criminal band that forced her to be a mule drug. Computers @MONTH1 be exercising your brain, but they're not exercing you and that's what really counts. Even if you were on the computer doing research for a school project, the computer still wouldn't help you. Maintaing cars are expensive.Public transport you do not need to worry about any petrol filling, checking tyre pressures, getting tired after driving long journey.In future cutting down public transport affects many of the people.Elderly people wont able to drive always depends on public transport.If public transport stop services people who are not able to drive will  affect a lot. No progress will happen without plan .Each one has a dream want to achieve it but first of all he need to put a plan and also cognitive one . You might look at it and read it, and even if it sounds good to you, that doesn't mean that it's right. I will tell you a review of a thriller, the thriller is Hunger games it is about some capitals and people are choised and play on a game, you have to kill persons for they don't kill you, is a movie that have suspense because you want to know ho survey, in the movie someone love someone and protect each others, is very cute but on the 3 movies they are bad moments with the family, capitals, Friends, etc. I am also committed to preparing monthly reports for newspaper supplement “The Voice of Women” which issued by the WATC “Women's Affairs Technical Committee , and I have the cooperation with the Environment and Development the magazine which issued by Center for development work ""Maan"", annd other web sites and news and media organizations. People just type what they are looking for into the google search box and press enter. Strange things happen in the house, they are ""intruders"" in the house, anne saw many times someone called victor who ""play`s"" and the mother thinks she is lyeing but after a while she believe her and started searching for the intruders. Then all of these different windows are popping up and you are far from where you were. People then just give up and start goofing off on the computer because they don't feel like trying to get back to that page. for example,using wind Energy or Solar Energy for electricity generation we will be used less fuel what is affected in emissions. People should be focusing on family and friends rather than playing games on the computer. When alison knock on his parents door she noticed that there were many people in her parents house, a man open the front door.When she entered  the house ,a man was looking at her with a bad face,when suddenly this man shot with a gun to Alison father. It's better to invite them over and have some fun playing board games or just talking in person for a change. Even if your spending time with your family or friends you're probebly thinking about the computer the whole time that they are there, so go out and do something for change, a little fresh air wouldn't kill you. You should go to an amusement park, ride some rides with your cousins, do something that will keep your mind off the computer. People don't realize it, but after spending so much time with your family, rather than your computer, you will acually notice what you have been missing out on for so long. As you can see, computers aren't helping anyone. It's either not exercing, getting false information, or not spending time with your own family! Seems to me that having computers around isn't everything that it's cracked up to be."	2
222	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"My name is Abrar saeed Al-mubarak.I'm 13 years old.I live in Saudi Arabia(Riyadh)  .And i'm in grade nine.I have 9 sisters with me we 10 .And 9 brothers.I really love to learn English lounge & French lounge spinach lounge  .And I speak Arabic . Almost anyone has access to movies, magazines, newspapers, music, books, television and radio. While these examples @MONTH1 seem relatively innocent, there are many cases where they can be found very offensive. Strange things happen in the house, they are ""intruders"" in the house, anne saw many times someone called victor who ""play`s"" and the mother thinks she is lyeing but after a while she believe her and started searching for the intruders. To my mind our lives has been improved in these years by smarphone, satnav, digital TV, Internet.. Let's suppose a teenager of twenty-first century during the Middle ages.. don't get out alive without Wi-fii! According to the information donne, the most used is the car thus most of the families has one, but the public transportation is getting more and more common for those ones who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectfully with the planet. Certain materials, such as books, music, movies or magazines should not be removed from the shelves, even if they are found offensive. The act of censorship in libraries, or anywhere, should be looked down upon. But a good change of our habit is attention to calery food and healthy food because of get information on internet and another media that are accessible way for all people easily these days. If someone finds a book offensive, then the solution is simple: don't read it. Others @MONTH1 find the book to be inspirational and uplifting, and taking the option of reading it away from the person is wrong. There are many forms of entertainment that could be taken the wrong way and be offensive to people. first we uses Internet to discover the world's news, from Internet we can check and read world's most famous newspaper such as new York times, the sun and also electronic newspaper.Internet also can be used to learn and to educate yourself, internet allow us to read books, magazines and short stories.Internet is the most effective way to start a business and to look for a job, many people uses Internet to work , and they earning money every month.Internet is a way to make new friends all over the world through social websites such as Facebook,twitter, and you tube.As a conclusion internet is making things better and easier, life now is always connected to the Internet. Taking away all offensive books would do away with a large portion of books available in libraries. one day Micheal wanted to go out from his home so he called his besfriend an suggested to go out togther , his friend agreed , so Michael weared his closes , wnet out and closed the door but at this moment he knew he had made a mistake . The book should not be taken away from other people just because someone @MONTH1 be offended by it. Everyone has a different view on things. Many people @MONTH1 think one way about something, while other people think of it completely different. This is why all different forms of books, magazines, radio and music could be offensive to people. For example, a person @MONTH1 be offended if a book talks about a certain topic while another person thinks nothing of it and reads on. This person @MONTH1 enjoy the book and pass it on for others to enjoy. Looking for any sport make you feel good and your brain be always refresh so that you  can begin your day with any sport to making fresh and after that you can make any job with refreshment mind. Just because something is offensive to one person, does not mean it is offensive to everyone. I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong. Third, this is the most important step that printed sheets manually inspected,the this sheets are classified three areas.The number one called good quality sheets,they will be packed and dispatched.The next called partially damaged shees,and bank notes separaed into good and bad, good sheets will be cutted into separate bank notes and packed,the bad one will be destroyed by fair.The number three called bad sheets ,they will be securely destroyed. Firstly, the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel.Secondly, the public vehicle route are more far than usual route.Thirdly,it is also crowded and no privacy.Finally,there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker. If a person finds a book, for example, to be offensive, they can easily stop reading the book and pick another one. No one is forcing them to read something they don't want to. The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots. But now I really enjoyed, and me best friend both for me ticket for a theatre to see the musical show ,which was amazing, for cuople of hours I didn't move, was a brilliant present."	2

"Wouldn't you agree that computers are needed in our life. The social networks such as: Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,Google plus... are connecting  us to more and more friends, companies, public figures, books, films, social organizations...we are really have many things to see, to think, to ""like"", to ""comment"" and a dozen of stuffs that we can make an action to interactive with others...so may it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves, to take care our healthy. Although healthy diet is quite expensive young people follow special diet in order to have better body shape or healthy life.Actually modern life affected on our palate changing .Instance some people who work majority of their waking houres prefer to use fast food more.Our commitments imposes us to forget ourselves and our healthy . My first reason why I agree that computers benifits society is because of the communications. Firstly, staff and Personnel design the background colour , the artwork and the scuriity issues on the bank notes,which is also  done in process of other card,such as notes for supermarket.Then in the preparation process, skilled machinists prepare of metal plates for printing.After that sheets of bank notes are printed,there are differences and specials for it, it use special ink ,and print colors on both side,images are slightly rised. For example if you had a loved one in the military you could use the computer to communicate with him with a webcam. Nowadays a person's worth seems to be judge  according to the social status and material possessions, that is mostly to happen in high class famiies, as they are foccus on achievements as power, political influences etc. Also you could use computers to communicate with somebody selling something you @MONTH1 be or, you could get more detail about that product by talking to the owner of it through maybe email. many countries are truly started to concern no environment and worried about the globe warming ,In schools teachers are doing their best  to educate children how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy,also they train them how to plant trees in public gardens of their towns ,Although  government strict so many laws and taxes in the people how do not pay their taxes to the council for cleaning of the rubbish from towns and villages,in the biggest polluted city in the world people started to use bicycles and cycling instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city,also they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive. We can change  everything hurt us if we need if we have volition The reasons for  stress are more diverse perhaps because  we have an  exam period,  family proplems or because we think in negative way,  or we destroyed  ourselves  in long hours of working and canceld our needs  for enough comfortable,  and  lots of reasons to stress...   We must get  out of  the stress quickly before  lose ourself because it's very hurtful period, for example you can read a  book,  doing sport,  play music,  eating delicious food, remmeber  all the positive thing was took place with you,  talk about someone who trust for him,  take off every thing make you upset and make you life tiring,  go out and eat meal with your best joking friends,  and  there a lot of you have to do...   Remmeber the stress is not  lasting thing,  and you can avoid  it  But if you  are willing  to live in happy life. For some students instead of study in classroom all day they could be learning from computers and it could be more to the students so maybe they would understand topics better. One of the example is television, in the past we use it only for watching news and movie, but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t, now television has others function. He selected people to into in a chinese room, there was a computer in chinese language with diferente symbols, the american was a diferente behavior, they did not understand what was in the computer screen. My third reason would be buying and selling products. Many people all over the world go on the internet to buy or sell products. Like ebay that is a website many people items on to make money and other people can buy them. firstly, that private transport provide a comfortable mean to travelling from one place to another without sharing stranger people a way and by using this kind of transport also comfortable in free with choosing time of a trip."	2

I know I do! I know that people shouldn't be to computer, talking to people. But its a great way to stay in touch with people. They have awesome websites like skype and oovo that allows you to chat with other people over. Friendly, educated people agree that this is a good way to catch up with old friends from highschool or even way back to grade school. According to the problems above mentioned,various approaches that governmentshould be adopted to deal with this problem.first of all,reducing building constructure from now on,planting more trees instead.Sustainadle development should be awaness to all human and start to porteat the environment and preserve the animals. Newly explain, now they not online and got so close they ! Personally I know that I go to @DATE1 camp every year and make new friends. Internet websites like facebook helped me keep in touch with her. This is due to Lima in the beginning  has not had a pant to desing its public road s and highways, and it only has been improvising to build their way without any criteria to transport its population. Good morning everyone,today I want to share about is my favorite sport.My favorite sport is football,why I choose it?Well,football is a international sport,people around the world will love it so much!Example like Barclay Premier League,Liga Premier,Fifa World Cup and so on.I believe that's all will delighted us.By the way,my favorite football team is Manchester United,they are brilliant,they have an amazing football players,and they are awesome. Without a doubt it will certainly help you; hand eye coordination and keep you talk or recconect with people. Most importantly it gives people the ability to learn about the wonders of far away places. So dont make the wrong choice, and appreciate and use all this computers have to offer."	2
225	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Even though do not everyone doing that,so how much public office is care of environment is important and this town is care of that a lot.Every morning some peasons are coming park and cleaned that makes feel really thanksgratitude. This is a great advancement in our society! Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. @ORGANIZATION1, computers are making a great impact! Firstly, computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination. public transport is very crowded so you may not have a seat .I hate public transport as I was attacked by mad man once .also taxi is  not a good transport .I wish I have my own car soon to get rid of public transport . Statistics show that sports players who own computers are @PERCENT1 more talented at things requiring their hands (like baseball or basket ball) than those who do not own computers. Owning a computer improves the way you use your hands in other activities too. Something as simple as driving a car doing the dishes is made easier thanks to the improvement in hand-eye coordination computers bring. This is a fantastic effect that computers have on people. cars are faster than public transport so cars are more convenient than public transport it is easier ,faster and more comfortable especially in long distances so governments should improve public transport as not all people have cars This splendid information is easier to aquire thanks to the technowlogy of computers. my father  my father name is Zaheer arat.he is very loving and caring.they gives us all the facilities one should have and dream of these things.he provides all the facilities to us of internet and books so that we can learn better and can be good students and get good marks in the examination.he always encouraged us and said don't afraid of anything because you are braver than anything else.my brothers and me proud of my father.he is very hard working and brave.he has the smiley face.he always tries to laugh other people with their jokes.he always listens to us what we want.he never ever ignore us. I had a terrible experience in this Chinese New Year!Because Norovirus infected me!At first,I had a high fever but I thought if I take some medicine I will be fine.Therefore,my condition took a sharp turn for the worse.I cannot eat anything even in New Year's Eve and I was so tired that I cannot play poker with my cousins.Though everythings were depressing,I still have a wonderful winner vacation with my family:we went to  Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village(九族)to visited its blooming cherry blossom. In old times luxuries were not considered as compare to Heslth but now every one prefer to save time and maintain privacy which one can only afford by using her/his private transport so gradually public transport losing its charm. I went to a  awesome concert of points of view and I know that I look forward to telling you how it was.But let me tell you it was a concert that the  performed Lala Band and I have taken and I especially, I was the cameraman.It was an excellent night.The concert was evening began at 20:00 and came a lot of persoane. Finally, computers have a positive effect on people because they help them communicate with each other. In this view, I consider, though, there is lots of sports on Televison, they are not too much, because the people have looke for it. As Automotive Industries are huge in market, most of the  house holders  prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time . The creator of the haven and the earth, the creator of soles , the one who make earth rotate around it self and around the sun.What we belief as Muslims that, we have created by one who don't have other with him the one who create our father (Adam ) and created from him (Eve) and they were in the Paradise and instructed to not eat from the tree but the Satan deceive them so they brought to this life and generations came from them and had sent the prophet and messengers ( Moses, Jesus, Mohamed, others.. who they worship the same one) with Miracles and evidence of the truth, to guide the people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to the Paradise and who follow other paths which it will guide to the hell. Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people; and even allow people to talk online with each other. So, @PERSON2, the increasing number of computer users is a beautiful thing! Ask yourself this, how would computers have a positive effect in your life?"	2

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever wondered what effect computers have on people? i dont think the public transport does not have future, there are a lot of people who can not buy a car and has to use the communite transport. Computers are one of the main reasons of why kids do not exercise and become obese, it can effect students' grades, and by being on the @CAPS6, you are isolating yourself from your loved ones. First of all, more and more kids are using computers way more often than they should. The result of this, you @MONTH1 ask? Since computers are used daily, especially by young adolescents, it is likely for that child to become obese. Nowadays,an increasing number of people are concerned about the phenomenon that armland ,forest and wetland is disappearing for some long-term human activities,for instant housing and transport networks is builded by destroying the balance of environment. After speaking with @PERSON1, graduate from @LOCATION1, he told me that when children spend more time on the @CAPS6, they are doing nothing but staring at a bright screen that can damage their eyes, and not spending their time outside enjoying the beautiful weather. As a consequence, kids start to gain body fat from sitting on a coach staring at the @CAPS6 all day instead of exercising! Strange things happen in the house, they are ""intruders"" in the house, anne saw many times someone called victor who ""play`s"" and the mother thinks she is lyeing but after a while she believe her and started searching for the intruders. Moreover also simple things are changed, for example the food we eat: some times ago everythingh was natural, healthy... but now everyone eat always ""junk food"" and thinghs like that, which are completely unhealthy ! And to day is necessary because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversation with their you need to now more than your foreign language, because in the rest of the world and particularly in Europe people now more than two language and that great. This shows that even ""A"" students are getting bad grades from being on the @CAPS6. Second advantage is Internet by website, such as twiter, facebook... You allow speak with your quick friend, or you can meet ith them by website, therefore you do not call by telephone, so internet is too much cheap. This shows that by always going on the @CAPS6 you hurt your academic skills. My last and final reason of why computers have a negative effect on children is because it harms your social skills of being on outgoing, talkative individual! Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath...deep one and started to dive . This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Spanih´s food is fantastic, althouh there are a lot of restaurant for eat you and i think that the food is more expensive than your country.If you don´t like spanish´s food you can go restaurant the other country, but i know you love it. You will end up never spend time with them and you will never call your friends to see what they are up to if you keep on going on the @CAPS6. Furthermore, if your mom or dad tells you to get off your @CAPS6, you become cranky and rude to your family just becuase you want to go back on your favorite electronic device. when I find me in London, I'm going to the buckingham palace located in the city of westminster and I'll see your art gallery and tourist attraction of the British monarchy continue in London, I will visit to the largest parks in London, the hyde park that having a full day of guided outdoor games and activities for perservation thereof park follow in London I'll go for a walk to arrive at the big ben that is the most beautiful bullding in all its splendour when I will take pictures later, I'll take the underground of London that is a public fast transit system, I'm trawiling in it when I'll leave of the underground in the station wembley park I going to the wembley stadium where I will enjoy an evening of football, the match started at 8:00pm So, in summing up, computers are a negative effect on many young individuals, and the reasons for this are that you have less time to exercise, it harms your grades, and you are not able to be as interactive with people by being on the @CAPS6. The real question is, though, is do you think computers have a negative or positive effect on people?"	2
227	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Success Results From Careful Planning
Many people want to success, so they study and work hard. To start with,there are a wide range of troublesome it maybe leadding to this phenomeon.Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the persent day cities are already packed with places of residence,commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce.Additionally, people now continues destroyed more agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their need,which will distory the ecosystem  diversity and biodiversity especially the endangered species. One they animals went with Ana and give her an incentive for being an athlete or make something else than stay sleeping. So my idea is aii the coutries allthe people stop to use farmland,forest andwetlang to build houses grow more trees portect our world,our homestar! First of all, people who have careful planning are always prepared. As they make plans and think about the plans in their daily lives, people with plans are usually very goal-oriented; therefore, they have high  possibilities to catch chances. I like going to the cinema, get out with my friends,  to playing the counter strike, walking to the park, going the shopping and can't stand watching the blood. In addition to prepared attitude, people who have careful planning think about alternative ways when their plans go wrong. Nevertheless travel by car is easier for commute for example, because they can choose a personal timetable without a terrible discomfort of buses; in addiction there is a fair chance that by the end of this century dwellers will stop travelling by public transport, in special way if the government have invested his money in green energy and we could discover a new green car, which in turn revolutionary our life. People who prepare these situations less fail to do or get something they want, and this phenomenon leads them to success. Some argue that big chances and luck is needed to success; however, people who have no plans cannot even notice these chances. public transport is very crowded so you may not have a seat .I hate public transport as I was attacked by mad man once .also taxi is  not a good transport .I wish I have my own car soon to get rid of public transport . To sum up, people who have careful planning always have prepared attitude, and they also have some alternative plans. Therefore, careful planning makes people closer to their goals and success. But, on the other hand, because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable; cars are so many; very noisy, unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth."	2

"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 our technology advance, so do are lives. although traveling by car is really interesting but still using public transport has its advantages ,by using public transport you're saving  effort when  driving a car for along distance you will get tired , some people don't have enough money to buy their own car . It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. Computers give us a bright future. First many people, actually @PERCENT1 of the worlds population are generally stationary, and line in a local town or city environments. At first, I had called a travel agent but he said he couldn’t be able to book me a flight before two months, so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent. What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player ,i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families, From there, @CAPS3 can look at different topics in a wide spread point of view. In doing this @CAPS3 will connect to other ways of life. On one hand you put all your things in the car and drive anywhere you want to, on the other hand if you feel not very well to drive, you have no money to buy a car or the downtown of your city is closed for all the means of transport except for the public ones: tram, bus or trolley bus is your wayout. @CAPS4, another particularly handy function of the @CAPS5 through computers is @CAPS3 can communicate with people who live far away, when @CAPS3 couldn't visit otherwise. A @LOCATION2 study showed that actually @PERCENT2 of use of the computer is communication with sites like facebook or @CAPS9. A scientist in @LOCATION3, @PERSON3, says @CAPS3 @CAPS2 humans tend to enjoy communication because it gives @CAPS2 a sense of unity. This is why so many companies are realizing that sites like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS6, and @ORGANIZATION1 are gaining in popularity."" I had truancy and did not pay attention to studies.That really the biggest harm to a hard-working woman whom my mother tried all her best to feed me up and help me complete my studies.All the members of my family never give me up,and I finished my college studies ,too .I have a good job now.I do really thank my mother and all the members for paying the patient and exertion to me .Now we have  great relationship with each other and treasure the happiness  we get not so easy.So,are the members of my family my best friends？I'll answer you ：there's not much better answer than Yes！ one day he got fight with her sister, even he made her cry.both of them stop talking to each other and after some day the boy need laptop of her sister sukh. Without computers, this couldn't be possible. Some people say that basket it's only for tall guys but it isn't true, in the A league in Italy we have different players not very tall like 1 meter and 60 , so if you love this game you can play it no matter what find only a ball and a hoop and play it. People can travel through the city easily and safely.For instance Melbourn,the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area.Therefore people don't need to drive cars for travelling in the city.The last point is people go for long journey by public transport.Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive. Just ask @PERSON2, who's voice reached out and caught the attention of a major record company. It is a time when children must choose, which people are good or bad, which way they will go to difficult situation for example they will be drink alcohol or they will have fun without any suplements. Firstly,design the bank notes' backgroud colour it is artwork security issues.Second preparation metal plates.It's skilled machinists.Then the sheets of bank notes printd .Printing colour on both sides and sprcial ink or images slightly raised. About half of computer use, "" says @CAPS1 to computer weekly, @PERSON4,"" is using blogs and videos to state one's ideas."" I am on third year at the university, I don't know what will be the master than I go to make, but I want a master relationed with programming. Self-expression is very important to society, and this is why computers have such an affect on people. @CAPS2 it is clear, computers have a positive affect on people and society. They allow us to learn about faraway places, communicate with others, and inspire the world around us with our ideas. Welcome to the future."	2

There are denying that the environment are changed by behavior of people and animals.For instance, people need to many places to build the modern society,so they fall down lots of trees,burnning many glasses.Another factor that the animals are not control themmselves to eat the plaints lend to distriction of ecosystem . He selected people to into in a chinese room, there was a computer in chinese language with diferente symbols, the american was a diferente behavior, they did not understand what was in the computer screen. it's for this reason that I think the public transport is a great benefit for the society, and a good way for move us of the one place at other,  I suggest that  the government  has to give more means for the purpose of improving the public transport. When you have skill to read a book and in that  moment you are searching for good job you can find  a lot  jobs because you can develop easy when you compare with another person that they have been searched  job to Without computers, many people would lack hand-eye coordination. If you are driving a car on the highway, when suddenly a car swerves onto the wrong side of the road and is heading toward you, you need to react fast. Without hand-eye, you could die. There are company so much,they make our life polluted.To take care of the environment,each of us has to do anything such as propaganda to the people in the country,...about my village, we use banana leaf stead of nilon, garbage desposal sensibly...and so on. My name is shousheng and live in Montreal Canada.Alrough Canada is an English country however in Montreal, the offical language is Freach. But, on the other hand, because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable; cars are so many; very noisy, unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth. Without it, people probably wouldn't be able to research a country with ease or learn about other people. Firstly,the growing number of private cars cause the big problem with traffic jam .People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam.That wastes people's time and make people feel exhausted.Not mention to say,it's definitely hard to enjoy travelling in holidays.Secondly,private  cars are the main reason for the air pollution.We should consider the protection of environment for human future,not only care about the convenience we can see for now. Like who won the election, or who won the sports championship. This is terrible, you do not have privacy authought the society have a blame, because if they do not take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored. The computer gives people the opportunity to chat online with other people. Some they @MONTH1 know in real life, or some they met online. It expands peoples interactive life, helping them make new friends. Though this is great thing to have acces to, it is still important to socialize with people in person, rather than socializing online. This town is located in the central zone of the Afghanistan with 4462(km²) space, and has more than seven Million populations, the economic and security situation is not suitable and these factors have directly effect in to the carefulness of environment. You can visit old city and watch old buildings and castel,you can watch the beautiful view from bridges over the water.Young people may like to take a walk in king garden,there is sakura trees.If you like night life you can go to some bars and night clubs that are open till morning.But there are two places that i meant in the beggining,its a big zoo called Kolmorden and biggest aquapark in Scandinavia that called Rusha. when i ran with the ball, i feel that i hold a goal or a valuable something and i should offer my best to put it in his place and make it in right way  . I support the advancement in computer technology because it gives people greater reflexs, gives people the opportuniyt to research faraway places, and gives people access to the internet to chat with people online. These are three huge advantages than using computers give people."	2
230	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"While smoking is indeed a proven health hazard, not only for the smoker but also in the form of secondary smoke on people in the vicinity, it does have its benefits and function in society. Smoking is a social activity - smokers usually do not smoke alone; they form a group that is just like any in society with a common topic or activity that includes and excludes people. In its worse form, it can even be a form of networking, of socializing (or, ironically smoking) your way to the top, a way of getting to know people in a relaxed, accepting atmosphere of common interest. Playing the cricket will also gives physical exercise to our body.we can bowl,batt,field in the cricket which  requires lot of  physical activities. To start with,there are a wide range of troublesome it maybe leadding to this phenomeon.Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the persent day cities are already packed with places of residence,commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce.Additionally, people now continues destroyed more agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their need,which will distory the ecosystem  diversity and biodiversity especially the endangered species.

231	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"My town do much efforts to care of environment,they put many pins in the streets to keep it clean also they prevent private drivinig at many days to keep air clean ,they seed trees to absorb co2 and release o2 ,they build factories away from the house of population to prevent respiratory diseases which is a result of air pollution from factories,so not only my country it self but also the individuals follow a proper way to keep environment clean. There are somes students who prefer to study alone, and not in a group. television entertains as well as it will educate the people.These days are educating themselves by watching the television.Televison not only provide entertainment it will give lots of information about the happenings around the globe.Channels like national geographic and animal planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origination of species.Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people They also believe that most of the students they study with would stop studying in the middle of the process, which would  affect them. Lastly, They also belive that if they study together in a group, they would not learn things in depth. Altough these reasons may seem quite fair in first glance, I belive that these reasons contains some logical errors, which is why I think that studying with a group of students is much better than studying alone. We can change  everything hurt us if we need if we have volition The reasons for  stress are more diverse perhaps because  we have an  exam period,  family proplems or because we think in negative way,  or we destroyed  ourselves  in long hours of working and canceld our needs  for enough comfortable,  and  lots of reasons to stress...   We must get  out of  the stress quickly before  lose ourself because it's very hurtful period, for example you can read a  book,  doing sport,  play music,  eating delicious food, remmeber  all the positive thing was took place with you,  talk about someone who trust for him,  take off every thing make you upset and make you life tiring,  go out and eat meal with your best joking friends,  and  there a lot of you have to do...   Remmeber the stress is not  lasting thing,  and you can avoid  it  But if you  are willing  to live in happy life. Maintaing cars are expensive.Public transport you do not need to worry about any petrol filling, checking tyre pressures, getting tired after driving long journey.In future cutting down public transport affects many of the people.Elderly people wont able to drive always depends on public transport.If public transport stop services people who are not able to drive will  affect a lot. Studying in a group can enhance the overall speed of learning. If we are studying alone, we cannot get help from anyone even when we are stuck. In contrast, if we study with the group of students, group members can help each other to move on, by sharing the understanting. From the beginning of the world till now , human wants the fast income and the easy ways of live , so he tries more and more to find a solution for  his problems by creating a new ways of liveing more easy and more convenient  for him. Secondly, some students fear group studying because other students in group may stop learning in the middle stage. They believe this could affect them, as well. There are many accidentally problems encountered by international students studying in Australia.It is believed that the most important one of the problem is culture barrier.Because of different culture backgrounds,the talking  style of internaional students who come from different countries are various. looking at the information in more detail.Initially,bank note should be considered the design such as background colour ,artwork,and security issues.then,the preparation of metal plates is next stage.bank note should be skilled and machinists.thereafter,this stage is printing .worker should pay attention to colour on both sides,special ink , and images slightly raised. This phenomenon can be explained by the ""collaborative work effect"". Collaborative work effect is the effect that people tend to work harder if there are co-workers who work on the samething. Co-workers would motivate each other while working, which makes less failure within the group. Firstly,hyrid cars only allowed to use during weekends as result of this most people not using there cars all the week. Last, and most importantly, some students may think that if they study with a group of students, they would not learn things in depth. Then ,the notes will be prepared with metal plates .After that ,printing ,the notes will be printred in colour on  both sides with special ink and it will images sightly raised . First of all,we should thinking out a design and dicide the background colour and artwork,or even security issues.And then for the preparation of metal plates ,the skilled and machinists is considerate.Nect,printing,sheets of bank notes printed (50 bank notes per sheet)colour on both sides,and specWell,the most important step is inspection,we should printed sheets manually inspected. If we want to understand some concept in depth, we may just ask ""I want to know this concept in depth."" For some reasons, I really liked to play basketball, first, playing basketball can train my muscle and make the body more healthier ; the second, my classmates and I all know how to win a game through the basketball game because the basketball game is a teamwork. Now, compare to the process of studying alone, we can always get a great help from our group members. If you are living in big town or small It does matter but one thing should be taking care by the people and organiser of the town, is environment.Global warming  is huge issue in today's date. finally ,a public transport need more costs , because public transport (such a buses , train ) fees every year is increasing, and this problem we do not face it by private transport , i think that this is the guestion for every one, and the answer can't be one for all, cause, someone can use public transport, and economy by this not only money, but and the environment, but some people don't like to use p.t., cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple don't like to travell with another people. It may also help students to finish studying until the end,  and accomplish the goal. Finally, students can teach their group members so they can learn in depth compare to studying alone. Next time if you have to study something, you may make a study group to study together, which will be a great help!"	2

"Most modern day book, movies, music, etc. Alison felt desesparate, she notice that her husband´s car were in her house, so he was walking or someone pick up to him, she takes the phone and she call all him group of friends, nobody now anything and now they were scaried. In this view, I consider, though, there is lots of sports on Televison, they are not too much, because the people have looke for it. Why? Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive. But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem. There are examples of how each catagory is in today's society. Take the book 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', written by @PERSON1, for example. one of the most amazing parts of the film is when Teresa calls Cruel for go for them and take them again to the Cruel building and like all of them doesn't wanna go with them they start a war and they take Mihno with them and at the end Thomas decide to go after them and he give a super great speech for all the persons go with them and help him to get back Mihno, and what i really want to see in the next film is that if Thomas is mad at Teresa( i never like her) and if they get free and the world comes back to the normal world. Travelling by car is convenient but there are dis advantage as well.As our population growing fast in a family both husband and wife working and children at university able to drive, so you are looking per house least 3 cars, so imagine how busy our roads will be.As now fuel price coming down that does not mean that it will stay like that for ever, price go up and down. Abortion is an immoral act that people make as everyone has a chance to survive and nobody has the right to decide for anyone life.Abortion has to be taken seriously in order to avoid these immoral action as these fetus are being deprive of their right since they have already a life.People had to be sensitize about abortion in order to decrease the number of women being abort.Furthermore,abortion is very dangerous and a great number of women had been death with this.Children has to be protected before and after life,it is why abortion has to be stop If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read. Travelling by using any transport has become in one of our needs, in the past people used to take hours waiting for the public transport, now, we can afford any of those modern car at the agency. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'leagally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has exsisted for years. I can tell you that I fell I can understand over 90% when I'm listening and when I´m Reading, but my main problem with English is of course when I must speak: I fell my self horrible without confidence, I think that always I'm thinking in Epanish and after makind the translation to English, may be in this moment when I'm writing this composition I'm making the same wrong. Nowadays, public transport is used for many people in the cities, we can find different types of them, such as bus tube and train, but is there a future for it or not?, I am going to respond this question giving disadvantanges and advantages and  finally I give my personal opinion. That is the fault of the parents. Following your letter , I want to tell you about The apartment is very Beautiful not big or small medium-sized left inside two rooms, a bathroom and a dining hall and an external director categorize overlooking a beautiful view I am sure he will like it  to come and Tri condo b soon ,n the end, I would say that I miss you too much and I hope to see you soon. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the @CAPS15. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay. The other matter is about our habit to eating food together with our family that were a custom in humanity life not just in our culture,but now because of hard and busy life ,we had to eat our meal  mostly days of a week. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. we can see that there are lots of serious and frequently weather disaster happened in decades, such as typhoon, hurricane, wild fire and mud slide. Environment is the sorrounding.there is no aleartness in our locality.they were busy in their own work.everyone were not focus or see what hapening in our place.they use to speak about how hot today is?but they dont know what makes this much hot.iam interest in planting tree and makes sorrounding clean.some people used to burn forest as if those forest is useless.man are greedy  because of all the thing  getting from the forest are free. as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! Thank you  very much Joe for think in me for to be your witnees, I feel very proud that you think in me for to be your witnees and of course I accept and I will  be in Toronto for your wedding. As long as i try to keep doing thing on a ecofriendly way i realize that i am give a little from my side and i feel careful of my environment. Sometimes the employers do strike and we clients do not known in time as a result we can not get on time to work,that is one of the disadvantages of using public transport. So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned. We separated paper from glass and also to plastic.The garbage picks up paper once a week,plastic two times at month and undiferretiated three times a week to all people who live in my country.My district makes clean my village and it usually tries to make attractive with new social initiatives for the community. Then the engineers call to other sector to ensure the doubt of Atlantis then the professional say that other was correct. the actions of this film took place in Alexandrie city of Egypt and it talks about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they didn't have much money to produce their own albums , that sort of bands is   famous between the youth and they call it ""under ground bands "" .their songs give a big concenet to the political and social stituation in Egypt and they become famous after the25 january revoulation , why I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society , there is no chance for the youth and if they found it , they face lot of problems to save it and they didn't find time for other activties and in sometimes they worked in thing which  they never learn or love Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their @CAPS15 view it in the first place."	2

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, walking into a room seeing people interacting with their computer screen I earning new and exciting, information they can everyday. The question is what effects do computers have on people? We were all excited, those from Lala Band minunate.Their voices have positive vibration through their musical and give you a good feeling.On the scene moves very well and know how to take pleasure to the public.I am feeling wonderful and my promise is that when going to have a special occasion to go to a concert supported by Lala Band, you will be with me.As like this in all my heart.I hope as those recounted by me in this mail and you feel a slight vibration from the concert. when am in the court other side participants are fear take off my service ball and am very at my position to cover the entire court. The village I live, there is a lot of vegetation for that reason we try to protect environment, some of the things we do is to give mantainance every week to the vagetation zone checking if there is any garbage, to avoid this we teach the younger´s enviromentalist actions so they don´t throw cans,paper,or,candies to the floor they also can help the older people, there are cases which a person throws garbage to the street´s,floor or to the vegetation to avoid that happening again we have a punishment that is to pay some money if the don´t they wont be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again, unless they were visitors, in that case we told him or her the way we live in the village and, we give him or her advises to keep a beautiful place without garbage. Computers have tought a very valueable to every user; hand-eye coordination! Whetver it's clicking a link to a site that you found on @ORGANIZATION2, or playing the matching same of bejeweled, you are learing hand-eye coordination. A cording to recent studies, over @PERCENT1 of people interviewed said they had excellent hand-eye coordination and @PERCENT2 said it was on the computer. Sure we all need to get exercise outside, but the computer can be helpful as long as we don't let it overwelm us. The sport is very importatnt of our body it has many benefits to emprove our selves and give us self confedant so we should practice any sport we love because it can change our mind to the better. Because you are the best teacher in the whole world!many of our class classmate really like you too!We know that you are going to teach  Discovery-bay  primary school .My English result is  better once  you taught me I really love you, Ms Cumings!your friend Ms Decock told me that  she is going to Australia ,and I love you two both I hope you that you will come back some times ! Picture this scenario if you will; A student at @ORGANIZATION1 has to do a project on the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1. He goes to the library to check out the encyclopedias but... they are out of date. He then goes to the computer lab and finds it on @ORGANIZATION2 like that! George's restaurant is a very pleasant place with many tasteful recipes from all around the world to enjoy alone or with your company your dinner.The Head-chef is an experienced and skillful man in his work.The food ,his team of chefs,prepare is always magnificent and the decoration a piece of art ,not to mention that the decoration is fully engaged in the Head-chef .Not only the food but also the restaurant itself is a very beautiful destination . Certainly text sources can give the same accurate information, but the computer is fast and easy. When you need information on the line. about my rest of family , as I said before they are just a relatives , but even if they are not friends almost ,but I do love them to much ,first one is my aunt ,the dead one ,and the other who still alive ,but i don't feel that felling of love towards my uncle , I do love him ,but he is just my uncle no more . not only can you get information on certain people and places on these machines, you can also learn what's the newest fads, what's carrently happening in @LOCATION2, and the latest @CAPS6 gossip. I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked.Pleasure to work at concerts is when  I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate.The experience  is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert. This amazing device can also let you talk to people online! There are many ways to do this. Travelling by car is much more convenient but all know really there is no future for public transport.When we talk about public transport,there are many people and everyone travel but i think we do not feel relax are there and if we talk about travelling by car.It is the best or much more convenient for us.Because we can travel any where but in public transport we can not travel to any other sites I reduce use of innecesary power at home, in other words,I turn on light that I need for the while i use it;I take less warm shower; I hit only neccesary rooms. I remenber a time when I was bored so I decided to do my homework. The problem was I forgot what it was! the citizens in the town must participate in this , the citizen will take the responsibility for specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish into correct place and clean tree and plant more of it . now days young people are influence towards the western culture so,they are getting more fashionable.youngster are interested to wear different stylish and colored clothes.they are happy with wearing different color clothes.they didn't want to wear our cultural dress such as sari,dhoti,choli and many more.they only like to wear shirt,pant skirt,t shirt and many more.youngster are influence by watching different programmes on  television. The people of my town try to plant plants in the centre or somewhere is too smoke, so they try to keep the air at recommended levels.on the morning a lot of people go on footto the work or to the school or ride a bike or they take the bus.The people try to move the local factories out of country where is less air polluted ,less smoke,less cars and more forests and plants. When I was returning from syleth I called the girl and talk to her and assure that I got chance in university but girl says that she knew it."	2
234	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"But in some day tow guise with quad bike and they saw some thing wrong they sad what's that , they sow dead body , they skared and run to ther camp . For poly students like me, we have many breaks in a year. Is summary,people taken many intiative steps and moving forward to have safe and attracticve eniroment surrondings. This way, we do not have to rely on our parents to give up all the pocket money. Volleyball its my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I were in another world, in which I can be free and happy, apart of this, when I am bad, this is a distration of the university. By having a part time job, students are also able to learn social skills and how to interact with other people and try out the different kinds of job until we find one that is suitable for them. We can also know what are our forte and what field should we work in when we graduate from our tertiary education. So for finish competition with pleasure I needed work out plan witch is diary day by day about our jogging distance, time, mood during work out. We separated paper from glass and also to plastic.The garbage picks up paper once a week,plastic two times at month and undiferretiated three times a week to all people who live in my country.My district makes clean my village and it usually tries to make attractive with new social initiatives for the community."	2

When I was returning from syleth I called the girl and talk to her and assure that I got chance in university but girl says that she knew it. People's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years ,Equipment and tools have evolved since the beginning of human history.In recent decades,however, developments have been particularly groundbreaking,Man has been able to invent machines ,which they have been put to work automation is  a great help to mankind,because it significantly increases the standard of living and frees people form hard work.The result is much less work and a better life. Overall, computers are the best thing that has ever happened to mankind. First and foremost our children today are already struggling in their educational systems. But with new computers they strive to meet every goal. when am in the court other side participants are fear take off my service ball and am very at my position to cover the entire court. The reason is the next, three days ago, he was working when a girl of his job asked him whether he had girlfriend and he told, I had one, come on you know my ex-girlfriend then she only walked without tell nothing. Learning to type gives these children better opportunities for success in later life. Family, say your child is out @NUM1 school day. Normally, they would miss their homework. But now, they can check it online and get back to their crucial studies when they are feeling better unless you want to risk tommorow's future workforce, computers are in essential tool for us, and our children.

Then peter stared "" happy birthday my lovely sister"" peter said and gave here key of a car Sara was so amazed and hug here brother and grateful him . I had truancy and did not pay attention to studies.That really the biggest harm to a hard-working woman whom my mother tried all her best to feed me up and help me complete my studies.All the members of my family never give me up,and I finished my college studies ,too .I have a good job now.I do really thank my mother and all the members for paying the patient and exertion to me .Now we have  great relationship with each other and treasure the happiness  we get not so easy.So,are the members of my family my best friends？I'll answer you ：there's not much better answer than Yes！ Firstly, the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel.Secondly, the public vehicle route are more far than usual route.Thirdly,it is also crowded and no privacy.Finally,there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker.

MEASURES IN FAVOUR OF TAKING CARE THE ENVIRONMENT The council is carrying out a project in order to erradicate the rubbish in my town.This project is focused on separating the rubbish in each green points of the city and also they have to maintain their neighbourhood as clear as are possible. Lets face it, computers are faster then us; way faster. But this is a god thing, because faster proccesing means faster research. While a simple machine @MONTH1 not tell us the cure through its proccesing speed. Some people say that basket it's only for tall guys but it isn't true, in the A league in Italy we have different players not very tall like 1 meter and 60 , so if you love this game you can play it no matter what find only a ball and a hoop and play it. Two minds are better than one. Even a scientist can not know everything.

236	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Should we censor the materials in libraries? i was at this team for 5 years and the made me even better in football.I played my first match at 16 years old and i felled very special because i was 16 and i was capable of putting 3 goals. last year I saw a movie called ''side by side'' , and talked a little of life in old history  , and coincidence I was having this matter in school, then it helped me a lot. The best season to sale the ice cream from the van is autumn,while that is one of the worst season for indoor swimming pool.The discrepancy of these two place is large.The best sale achievement of the van is 4500,5000,5500respectively. Books have been around for centuries. They are passed on, shared, and enjoyed by people all over the world. Books contain important information, stories, and tales of people's past times. Therefore, I do not believe that certain books should be banned from libraries. my English   language is weak , I like to improve it which complete my post graduate study,      The reason for choosing this specifically English language  in September  future I would like to get to know more information about   an English language course . My favourite sport is playing tennis.I play it three times a week (on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays) in the club of tui.I had been playing tennis from 2 years ago with two of my best friends.I enjoy playing tennis because it is a sport that requires skills, concentration and speed.I am not very good at all but I like to play it with my friends and do matches on Saturdays . when you have desire to do something, somehing you always dream to achieve it , something is touch you inside when not only do it but also when think about. Magazines are a great tool to advertise and talk about some major topics happening around the world. Magazines are a great thing to read when you want to catch up on news, sports, or just other miscellanious topics. Actually, we have a lot of problem with traffic: lots of cars in the railway and it don't running; the number of cars in the street cause a dirty pollution;  crawded railways causes a later destination. Dear Jo, As you know, my grandmother actually lives in France with my cousint Jonh, unfortunately he has to make three months course outside of the country, Jonh will leave France next weekend, but instead it is not possible, I have to go and look after her because none of my family cant waist three months over there. By getting rid of magazines, you take away company's freedom of press, which is a major issue. Refering to the previous paragraph, technology is growing, and it is very easy to just go and look at news, sports, and other topics on the @CAPS1. That is why I do not think magazines should be taken out of libraries. My final discussion is music. Music has also been around for many centuries and it has done many things. Football is my favorite sports In my life.so,I pay more attention to it than any other things you might think of.I had been following series of football's events in and around the world at large.I took this time to command people who are sacrificing their entire life of the betterment of sportsmanship.With all that,I do have my favorite club team n country as well.And also have my favorite players,Ronaldinho,Messi and Eto'o.My favorite club is Barcelona and country is Cameroon although that I am from Liberia.I know football doesn't go by sentiments but the love of choice and what desire you the best.What really makes me to love Barcelona is that they play the football,instead of them running around.They always bring talented players that will make the club be more improved tactically.people always say this;""Barcelona doesn't buy players""it's not like,they are lacking money.We do essential purchasing of players to save more money.You have to save money for players to enable you to pay them on time.As normal humanbeings,you have to know how to spend money,where,when to spend it.it's not because you have more money then you lavish it.So,i love my team and my staff and how they run things in my team.The facts should not be hidden Barcelona is the best club team in the world,you like or not. Reduce the fast food that make people obese and not healthy.It will be better if you gave drinks compared to the weather like whenever its winter we would like a hot drink and if it is summer we would like a chilled drink. By saying this, I do not think music should be taken out of libraries either. However, I have no agree with this statement because the public transport is needed for someone who are no have vehicle or economic downturn. We all enjoy it, but have different versions that we enjoy. Therefore, I do not think it would be wise to take away music from libraries. In conclusion, libraries are nothing without all the history, stories, news, and music that is inside of it. Censoring the libraries would not be a good idea and it would most likely upset many people. It is true that with technology that libraries @MONTH1 eventually become extinct. Firstly, staff and Personnel design the background colour , the artwork and the scuriity issues on the bank notes,which is also  done in process of other card,such as notes for supermarket.Then in the preparation process, skilled machinists prepare of metal plates for printing.After that sheets of bank notes are printed,there are differences and specials for it, it use special ink ,and print colors on both side,images are slightly rised."	2
237	What is a good hobby for college students? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"  As our society becomes more and more competitive, college students struggle to get a good credit at each of their lectures. Studying hard, students get enormous amount of stress, and many of them start to consider how they can release their stress in appropriate ways. Nowadays a person's worth seems to be judge  according to the social status and material possessions, that is mostly to happen in high class famiies, as they are foccus on achievements as power, political influences etc. After considering merits and demerits of the hobbies that students usually do, I think riding a bicycle is a perfect hobby for college students. First of all, students can fulfill the time that they should spend working out to maintain their health. Many college students do not enjoy playing sports and have no time to exercise during the semester. The One of the most amazing thing that attractive you, is that it has  safari  which is more enjoyable thing ,at the sometime,it is introducing you to a wildlife  without needs to go out from your city. After all the lectures end, they have to do the assignments. last summer i worked at cinema.i think it is a very good job because you can see any films you like for free.The minus of this work is very big salary and i think that i will work at this cinema on the next summer. Further to the trade fair of the last week where we were a pleasure to meet you and we were talking about you courses. The last mistake that I have had to have been when I changed the telephone company because since I changed I have many troubles. ""Annabelle"" is a horror movie which i am going to watch this Saturday.I am wondering if i will be scared after the movie.The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was closed in a museum from Conecticut where she is visited  by a preist  who blesses her twice a month.John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife :a beautifull colection doll dressed in a wedding dress.Unfortunatelly,in a horribble night the couple""s house was invided by a satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them.The satanists invoced an eavel entity that is capabale of the worst things...Annabelle.After Mia gives birth to her doughter Lilly,Annabelel wants to kill her.Even the preist doesn's know how to help the unhappy familly.Everyone is terryfied and find out that a demon is attached by the doll.Idon't know the end of the story but i don;t think that is a happy one... In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that doesn't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used,so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground. They are called below: 1- chaharshanbeh soori 2- Norouz 3- sizdehbedar  chahrshanbeh soori:  It meaning Tuesday night of week and take place on last Tuesday night of the year .at this night people make a bonfire and jump over the fires and say to fire :I give you my sign of sickness(yellow color)and you give me your healthy sign (red color)and eat some special foods . As the result, I became more and more fat and I felt that I was becoming unhealthy. After that I start to go out and ride a bicycle after I had done all the tasks that I had to do. Since then, I was able to be in shape and get some energy to move on to the next day. hello  my name is Mustafa I am 23 years old and I am Student in collage I search for job but I don't find a job I wish that my country become a great country and better and I wish to married who I love her  thank you In addition, bicycle is not a heavy exercise, so students can enjoy it easily. i dont think the public transport does not have future, there are a lot of people who can not buy a car and has to use the communite transport. Although healthy diet is quite expensive young people follow special diet in order to have better body shape or healthy life.Actually modern life affected on our palate changing .Instance some people who work majority of their waking houres prefer to use fast food more.Our commitments imposes us to forget ourselves and our healthy . If the hobby makes students suffer from a pain or too exhausted, students have trouble doing assignments or studying for the exam. In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life, but majority of ones is totally utopic. However, unlike those, riding a bicycle is good to enjoy and is a appropriate exercise for college students. This book made me interesting and I begging reading more and more while I read the more I love it  this time everything  did not matter to me I want to finish the book  as soon as possible I do not know the end but I want the end of the book was amazing but the same time I do not finish the book because the mystery to open up finished in. For instance, one of my friends , Kim loved playing soccer with friends. Whenever he have some time to play it, he was always in a soccer field. I thought that it was very good to have a field sport that one can do as a hobby. my advice is be patient, be smart this sport not easy but it's need more trainee, more time to be one of the greatest player in the game my favourite sport is swimming , it makes me feeling comfortable and left me in a good mood , i go to swim twice a week , and my advice to anyone want to start to enjoy every moment of it The gym has many problems that we are gouing to explain : the first problem is that we don´t have enough aparatous for all of the students  the second problem is about that same aparatous are not working well because the school didn´t the manteinace long time ago For the first problem in my opinion , the school have to buy some others aparatus because there are not enough for all of the students For the second problem the solution for me is to hire someone to do the maintenance and say to all of the students to take care of the machines of the school I hope my proposal wiil be useful for you I look forward to hearing from you soon Sebastián Ferrari Now, he is very satisfying at riding a bicycle, because he can do exercise and not become too tired. Like this, student can enjoy bicycle easily. For these reasons, I think that riding a bicycle is the best hobby for the college students. However, public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a new car and for the adventurer who want to have an exciting travel for then to see more action.Like watching outside or sight seeing,to mingle and meet different people.In addition to this I also admire the bullet train in japan which u consider fast and safe public vehicle Ive'd known."	2

However, when it comes to polluting the air that billions upon billions depend on, it becomes nothing less of a grave matter with which everyone is rightfully entitled to an opinion. While some may enjoy having their lungs turn to ash and their lifespan shortened by years, others are more concerned about health of their own and the world. Asking about whether or not smoking should be banned is just the same as asking the Pope if he's a Christian. There are many sports grounds for example tennis cort,football grounds and play equipment for child so I think my town takes care of environment that makes everyone will be able to best condition in both mind and body long time.

This afirmation: travelling by car is so much more convenient say everything, for example if we think a lot of time we spent on wait bus to arrive our destiny, the traffic is a lot of things that everyone prefer  buy car it more practical and fast. I think that the  public  transport always going to be so important in our life  because  not all the people have the possibility to buy a car because the public transport is more expensive than a car, so for that reason the public transport in the future  could be exist, because public transport is a necesity in all the world not only for the money but too for the facility to take a bus or any other public transport Do you have no shame for the diners who just want a good meal or atmosphere? Let me just say that I don't have anything against smokers but learn to do it in the right time and right place. Nobody wants to inhale your smoke.

Even related budgets are being cut a lot. In old times luxuries were not considered as compare to Heslth but now every one prefer to save time and maintain privacy which one can only afford by using her/his private transport so gradually public transport losing its charm. There are two reasons for spending this money for our basic needs on Earth.

What people can get right now through space exploration is just scientific progress. Some claim that these advances can bring resources from space or move to new planets outside of Earth, so it is worth spending a lot of money. Education has a crucial part in one society and it’s future and by improving the level of educations system, students can learn more effectively in their entire education life and their career but also their skills will be improved by this process. Everything about space exploration is just a probability. Rather than space exploration, people should focus on solving many problems that human needs to be solve; plague, war, hunger poverty and climate change. The next reason is that human has not yet fully grasped the Earth. i love my family special my little sister, she has sixteen years old, i consider my best friend because i used to tell her everything of my life. However, the advances in technology have uncovered new oil fields and found alternatives such as oil sands; therefore, oil is still abundant and reserves are unpredictable. In addition, people do not know the sea too. Otherwise the public transport don't pollute but the car pollute so for us travelling by car is better than travellng by public transport but for the atmosphere is better travelling by  public transport than travelling by car Recently, people use submarines for exploring deep sea, so can get information little by little. The mas was armed try to steal the backpack.But he not be fixed that the man was a camera in his head and hi action was filmed. If the public transport will be by higher quality, faster and fewer rates, majority of citizens will be prefer: is more calm to relax and read a newpaper or a magazine during the way in a collective transport than an indiivdual one; moreover, the time spend up to go and came back will be reduced, because it promotes less car in the railway. Instead, focusing on the Earth will still have some unknown places to explore and help solve many of human's problems. Firstly as everybody know the cost of the fuel is increasing more and more,  adding to those the bill that own a car will bring, it became immediately clear that it is cheaper go around by public transport."	2
240	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"After WHO designed pandemic situation, various changes have occurred. I grew up in a parent family.Sometimes I felt that I was alone and not loved.However,we were lucky enough to have a great mother who tried  all her best to keep my older brother，my older sister and I for completing our college studies .Of course my uncle ,young brother of my mother gave a big hand to go through the hard,so that made us often help each other in my family when the member who was in hard.Especially I was the youngest member in the family ,made much more troubles when I was young . In this regard, at the first time, many colleges delayed their classes. However, as pandemic situation lasts longer, many colleges suggest the online method instead of traditional method. Let’s discuss about the several benefits of taking online courses. this situation to create many pollution for environment so we have more conscience for the planet health To listen the face-to-face lecture, students must go classroom on time. If they have trouble to adjust their time table, they need to run from previous classroom to next classroom in order to arrive the place without being late. Today personal vehicle become pride of the life , mean if a person is on there personal vehicle they are look as higher status in the society . I'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant its name is ""Lemon"" I go there every week it has different food from any restaurants I'd like chicken crispy with garlic sauce It's Excellent choice for me and My favorite appitizer is susage and in order that desert I'd rather ""Vadge"" cake with chocolate sauce I feel I;m at ease when I go there I enjoy  classical music over having a lunch about the service It's very good and all staff are respectable I can't imagine one week without going there that drives me nuts I advise any one to go there and enjoy  a time there , also this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really It's  excellent This strikingly thing for anyone  despite all of these advantages prices are not expensive . It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. The mas was armed try to steal the backpack.But he not be fixed that the man was a camera in his head and hi action was filmed. Some online class progress without any fix time. So,my favourite sport in the present time it is street workout.I have been exercising this sport already long time.I like to exercise on the street even in the season when the temperature outside below zero.Of course, in summer I like to exercise more than in winter but this don't stop me.I don't know myself why,but I almost every day go on the street in order to exercise.If  It is very coldly and windily outside,I don't worry about it and I'm exsercising at home.For those people, who want to start to exercise the street workout I'm advising to start with basic exerscises such as pull ups,push ups,dips and squats.That everything basic exercises and they will help you will do a good start up.After some time when you will be feeling that you are ready for more, you can start to study more difficult exercises. With this change, students usually adjust their schedule. MOTASSEM is nice and lovely fiance he love his job as he is Patient will dong has jop .he is  a  hard worker he has amazing laughs     .When you started  talk with him you will be inspire by his knowledge and his way of talk he have the talent to Convinces  thought. In this point of view, online lecture makes their time table more flexible. No progress will happen without plan .Each one has a dream want to achieve it but first of all he need to put a plan and also cognitive one . There is so much information on online sites such as Youtube, Google. as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! Them they drink a cafe that give them many energy to construct faster the building, this café has a combination for the people can to live all the night. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately.He had to buy a present for his girlfriend´s birthday but it was Sunday and all stores were closed so he had to found a solution.A few hours,he was walking by a garden,and suddenly,he saw the most beautiful flowers that he has ever seen,so he picked them up.However,flowers weren´t enough so he decided to think in anything else.Several hours later,he found an open sweet shop and he bought some bonbons for her.Finally,he had found the present and before the end of the day he ran quickly to his girlfriend's house.If you don't want to pass this situation,you must always do things with time. To summarize, the changes of way to open the class result in various advantages. Students gain various choice among the place where they take the class in. Adjusting their time table became capable. Fifty minutes passed ,when my body no longer was sore.I decided to walk to the end.Constantly,I just walked like without terminal contest.While I strugged to walk.Finally,I saw a light to appeare my eyes and I woke up. If we improve the way of online course, we can overcome this situation."	2
241	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"    University students encounter many problems and stress. The best thing that make most students relax and enjoy is food. However, students also have problems during their meals. Have you ever experienced a crowd of people during lunch time in school or university? The answer is simply; this museum has many types of momias.In 1810 have been a war for indepedent of Mexico many people were fight with other people; for example: Miguel Hidalgo is considerate: ""The father of indepedent"" and he was to fight with monarquia Spanish. I am the one who had encountered this problem since primary school until university. Therefore, if I could change one crucial thing about my university, I would like to make a change in cafeteria with these three aspects. First of all, an increase in cafeteria’s capacity is important. about my rest of family , as I said before they are just a relatives , but even if they are not friends almost ,but I do love them to much ,first one is my aunt ,the dead one ,and the other who still alive ,but i don't feel that felling of love towards my uncle , I do love him ,but he is just my uncle no more . I think if the university could build a new cafeteria at the place near the East cafeteria, students would be more comfortable for their lunch. I will tell you a review of a thriller, the thriller is Hunger games it is about some capitals and people are choised and play on a game, you have to kill persons for they don't kill you, is a movie that have suspense because you want to know ho survey, in the movie someone love someone and protect each others, is very cute but on the 3 movies they are bad moments with the family, capitals, Friends, etc. They have to wait until that time. This also brings about crowded people in the cafeteria. Good morning everyone,today I want to share about is my favorite sport.My favorite sport is football,why I choose it?Well,football is a international sport,people around the world will love it so much!Example like Barclay Premier League,Liga Premier,Fifa World Cup and so on.I believe that's all will delighted us.By the way,my favorite football team is Manchester United,they are brilliant,they have an amazing football players,and they are awesome. Currently we have got more than six different types of banks in our streets but as far as I know it is not sufficient to meet the needs of the environment because nowadays we do produce a lot of different materials, all of them overproduced and we do only learn this education in our home in our childhood, accordingly I am one of the few worried teenagers in the world about it so I really do help the environments as far as I can. Finally, I would like to add a new rule for using cafeteria during lunch time. Sometimes, students who had already finished their lunch do not give their seats to other students who haven’t had their meals yet. Those students continue to talk to their friends after finishing their lunch, so other students do not have a seat. This behavior should be prohibited during rush hour such as lunch time, and the rule should be set. I have to say that study another language give you more opportunities  because on these days you need to now other language to look for a work and be more inteligent than your college to take the work and that’s great. Another good option is give them a difficult work for every day keep them busy, but I don't know what kind of job can be, because a person who commit a crime isn´t going to do something to help society like communitarian service. So, lets start, Most of the Metro cities are now days attract people of city towards Metro only not just because of the fare but because of the time that it saves. I think if the university cafeteria could be changed in these ways, students would feel better about their lunch and have more time left to do other activities during their break time."	2
242	Lifetstyle: Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"Get Up Early and Start the Day's Work
There are various types of people in the world and each of lifestyles is also different. Secondly,Closed trash bins provided to the people in order to collect the waste and recycling.People come forward and utilising this bin effectively instead of throwing away.As a result of this town looks clean compare to previous decades. I just finish my lunch time, and before prepare everything to go to work I was thinking of you and I wanted to give you a small surprise with this fantastic photos, I hope you like it. In my opinion, working on the daytime has several benefits. First of all, human body's biological rhythm is focused on the daytimes. Almost every person would experience it is more tired and exhausted after woke up for the all night, for preparing the exam, doing assignments, etc. This is because the rhythm has broken. Once the rhythm has broken, it is difficult to get back the original pattern, and it may cause the decline of the efficiency of work. In addition to the biological rhythm, working in the daytime gives more energy. Most of people are woke up in the morning and start to work from the morning to the evening. It can be easily observed that there are lots of busy people doing their job and work for the daytime. Working alone until late at night might be lonely; it may cause depressed feelings. The social networks such as: Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,Google plus... are connecting  us to more and more friends, companies, public figures, books, films, social organizations...we are really have many things to see, to think, to ""like"", to ""comment"" and a dozen of stuffs that we can make an action to interactive with others...so may it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves, to take care our healthy. Some jobs might need the time to concentrate on the creativity such as the musicians, artists, and so on. However, waking up alone until the late at night occurs too many thoughts that do not need to be considered. in my personal obinionits better to lern froma teacher not only dat you lern to pronounce the words correctly you also lern from a personwhat is in my opinion way better i thin k we spend enougth time on smart phones so i dont think its the best if we use them to lern as well. my town tries all the time to make our town more beautiful and comfortable by taking more care of the environment,they provide us by good buses which are friends to the environment and offer the tickets for this buses in a cheap price,they also trying to find the best way to make the rubbish more useful by the recycling,also the people tries all the time to find the best way for keep our village clean;they never throw the rubbish in the streets or the gardens,also they take care of the fuel in their cars to not to be bad for the environment,so,it's our duty to take care of our village and the whole environment beside the government. One day many years ago in something place that a don't remember the name I woke up one morning more earlier than usual then I went to the kitchen and shout the name of my mother...but no one answered, and the first thing that I imagine is that they come to the town, quickly I went out to find they... But there was no one, absolutely no one, I'm scary, I yell and scream, look and look but I had no result  Suddenly I felt a warm hand that touched my shoulder and very slowly turn but the only thing I saw was a shadow that was holding a knife     I woke up and realised it had all been a bad dream The most important step is inspect the notes which are good quality sheets and which are bad sheets.If the sheets are good,those sheets are then cut into separately and packed into cars in order to dispatach all over the city.If the sheets are bad,those sheets are then destroyed through burning. For example, the planetarium in a navigate room for learnt about the position of star, four small boats use for practiced the leadership and navigation in Pontevedra  river, or even the simulation for maked the situations which are seldom happen. Most importantly,manually inspected on each printed sheet in case that there would exist damaged sheets.Once damaged sheets are discovered, partically separate them into good and bad ones and them burn the bad notes,making sure that the remaining sheets are of good quality ."	2
243	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I have learned that some experts say that people spend too much time on computers when they could be excercising or with friends and family. I, on the other hand, think otherwise. Computers are a great way to learn and communicate with others, here's why: @CAPS3 of all, I would like to say how much computers help us in school. Most students use them every day. We can study for tests by looking for websites with lots of information and we can also research topics that we don't understand. Playing the cricket will also gives physical exercise to our body.we can bowl,batt,field in the cricket which  requires lot of  physical activities. Another way we use computers in school is when we have to make projects. Nowadays a person's worth seems to be judge  according to the social status and material possessions, that is mostly to happen in high class famiies, as they are foccus on achievements as power, political influences etc. Environmental changes really need in the current situation.People contribuation is very important in this matter.The report explains how my town people taking care of my surroundings and to preserve this planet in a betterway. If the teacher sets up a blog, students can always see what the class is doing, what the homework is, and find cool links that will help them understand certain topics better. Another point I would like to mention is that the experts say that computers deprive us of time with family and friends when the truth is, its the opposite, computers actually take communication to a whole new level. Them they drink a cafe that give them many energy to construct faster the building, this café has a combination for the people can to live all the night. A second way to communicate with friend is by @ORGANIZATION1, a cheap and easy way to contact friends outside the country. i was at this team for 5 years and the made me even better in football.I played my first match at 16 years old and i felled very special because i was 16 and i was capable of putting 3 goals. Secondly,tourism,especially in developed countries,has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view.There are countries,such as Greece or Bulgaria,in which the econmoy relies merely on tourism.If tourism influences the econmy,it thereby influnces the environment,and if it influences the environment it influences the transport.How?people become more careful at their historcal sites,this way preserving them;Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale:At a small scale,in cities, in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently.At a large scale,people can now travel in almost any possible way:on land,on sea or air.Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations. People can travel through the city easily and safely.For instance Melbourn,the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area.Therefore people don't need to drive cars for travelling in the city.The last point is people go for long journey by public transport.Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive. Hey my name is Joe and i´m 21 years old and i´l think i´l would compliment the summer camp very good, because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak. You could just go to a search engine and search any topic in the world and you're bound to finds hundreds of results. people that they play in this categorie are fameous althoug you can see them on tv.if you want to be a big football player you must to practise more time and yoor life should to be healthy. I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens.So I do not agree with this afirmation, in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport. Next, there are websites that allows you to ask questions and get answers just as fast. You might have to check your sources to make sure they're reliable, but I believe it's still worth it. Lastly, if you are getting ready to go on a trip, you can check flight information with the click of a button. Michael went into the teacher office,but he found that his teacher isn't here,maybe teacher went to the bathroom,suddenly,the door is opened by teacher,a teacher who wore bikini came into sight,this incident came as quite a surprise to Michael,she flirted with Michael,Michael felt excited but run out of the office,but he had regret for his action,Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Also 'internet' in our days helps to get information all over the world, and if you wish to get involved then go to the www.bbc.co.uk.These sites are free way to find most adequate information about actual events both in society and technical life. Next time, think twice about what you hear about computers because they really aren't all that bad for you. MOTASSEM is nice and lovely fiance he love his job as he is Patient will dong has jop .he is  a  hard worker he has amazing laughs     .When you started  talk with him you will be inspire by his knowledge and his way of talk he have the talent to Convinces  thought."	2

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 a world where nobody has any hand-eye coordination @CAPS6 they try to cath a ball it slips away. We as a human who live in these days , we live rely on technolgy, every aspect of our live are supporting by technolgy. !hhhh sometimes is funny but my husband he takes cars of me he doesn't allow to anyone to be much closer with me, my mother in law she likes swimming too  last night we went to the swimming pool it was a little bit cold but we liked so we went to the pool and srated to swimming i know how to swim very well but she doesn't she has to have a support otherwise she cant. In later time, society feel the need for change about iniquities that pass in the country and the Mexican Revolution explotes, the building is abandoned because the government and country dont have money for construction, to the point the building  metal estructure was used as weapons. For example, they help with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Computers have a positive effect on people and the society. Michael went into the teacher office,but he found that his teacher isn't here,maybe teacher went to the bathroom,suddenly,the door is opened by teacher,a teacher who wore bikini came into sight,this incident came as quite a surprise to Michael,she flirted with Michael,Michael felt excited but run out of the office,but he had regret for his action,Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. However, you can make it better by using computers and that is a fact. At first, I had called a travel agent but he said he couldn’t be able to book me a flight before two months, so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent. For example, my mom used to have horrible hand-eye coordination but now that she uses a computer and it is much better. Oprah said, “ @CAPS6 I was young I couldn’t catch a ball but now that I’m older and using computers I’m the best.” @NUM1 out @NUM2 people agree that computer help hand-eye coordination. Next, computers help other people learn about faraway places. I start this sport since I was 10 years old.where my father was playing this sport also,but he started it when he was more greater than me,He was about 30 years old.where squash is one of the games that can be played in any age,I love this game because I find it making exercise to all the body in the same time , we are running in small place moving hands in stretched and different ways in the same time you are working your mind in the same time so it need caring and quik thinkink, as much exercise you will find down the road . Summer holiday, I have been to Italy on holiday 3 years ago.I didn't have a long holiday ,it was just for 3 days but these 3 days were the best in my life.I must say that I went there because my sister is living there so I didn't have to book a room at the hotel and spending too much money.I went to the Vatican and Rome,I saw their massive buildings which were impressive and their old houses.The weather was fantastic ,I love bathing in the sun and resting on the hot sand on the beach. Yes,I think it also can educate.As times go by,technology is rapidly improving.More and more gadgets are invented such as televisions,smartphones and so on.There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly.Using will not only gain the entertainment but also get the knowledge.For instance,there are numerous program that we can choose.It is a good time to turn to the entertaining program,when we feel bored and gaze the wall all the day.Television provides educated varieties of channels as well.Discovery channel is posture-oriented model example to educate.We can learn how do the different animals feed on themselves.Above the statements can ensure a rich and abundant live. Firstly, staff and Personnel design the background colour , the artwork and the scuriity issues on the bank notes,which is also  done in process of other card,such as notes for supermarket.Then in the preparation process, skilled machinists prepare of metal plates for printing.After that sheets of bank notes are printed,there are differences and specials for it, it use special ink ,and print colors on both side,images are slightly rised. Finally, computers allow people to talk online. @PERCENT3 of people on facebook have at least one friend who live out of this country. one day Michael decided to make a surprise party to sinha to make her happy and feel his love more so he arranged everything and to keep it surprise to her he was busy all the time and did not show off all the week as usual .that make sinha worried and suspect that Michael do not love her any more and know another girl and she become extremely sad and even it become worse when Michael asked her to go to his apartment to make  the surprise to her  but he did not answer his phone after that . The best season to sale the ice cream from the van is autumn,while that is one of the worst season for indoor swimming pool.The discrepancy of these two place is large.The best sale achievement of the van is 4500,5000,5500respectively. Now @CAPS3 a world where every country got along because of online friendships. Where adults could play a game of baseball because they got their hand eye-coordination back. Where students could learn about distant places they didn’t know existed. In public transport people bound to share transport means with strangers and also we have to persue company policy or regulations,but with their own transport we don't have to bother about these things we travel when we want and when we have time. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places and allow people to talk online. So @CAPS1 @CAPS2 computers do benefit the society."	2

"After 4 days all came with spectacular pictures, portraits of people, large sculptures, to a student, her name was Sandra, she arrived with a piece of crumpled paper, old in which only had a name written in a style different letter, only there reflected, exposing the moment everyone laughed at her for her work, but the teacher said: Art is complex, and seeing that everyone laughed with the work of his partner, can see that nobody understood the real meaning, since art is different for each person, each creates a different definition, so we must respect each of them understand that each person is a different world and everyone is art. Today personal vehicle become pride of the life , mean if a person is on there personal vehicle they are look as higher status in the society . People who live on opposite sides of the world can communicate in an instant, for free. But what effect does this have on people? The film is a romantic movie, It is talking about one man, Noa, who lives in a small shore town when he felt in love with a rich girl, but like always the girl´s parents did not like Noa´s life because the girl´s father thinks that Noa is not enough good for their daughter. I don't think for some people it is. To start with basic, some people get too obsessed with computers. If they have life problems then they @MONTH1 seek the solitude and privacy of unfiltered and limitless internet. Only if the government develop more technical property,pay more attention to the environment protection ,such as build more trees and grass in the cities ,and set a special low for those missed animals will help decrease the harm that the building project brings to us. In fact, studies show that due to non posonal ways of communicating such as text messaging, email, or chat rooms, can severely restrict a pasons way of connecting with other people. Don't get me wrong here. I do use sites such as facebook to talk to people. So, I'm not going to state that online talk is bad. it's for this reason that I think the public transport is a great benefit for the society, and a good way for move us of the one place at other,  I suggest that  the government  has to give more means for the purpose of improving the public transport. In conclusin,the whole part of process is an unreversed schedule.It cosumemed the power which contained the humanity and machinic.Nevertheless,in my opinion the most precious of the revolution is the modern security measure through such a muti-developed society. It's done in moderation though. Getting information from the computer is very debatable. Some could say that the people being informed is a good thing, which I agree. Some others could say that knowing too much will make our egos so big that we will be ignorant. For all the people I advise to start to play or watching football because for me it is a very good sport , but you can play a good football only if you really like it , because first football is fun . In conclusion the public transport is very good and if it desapear it will be a big problem, is right that some times you need a private transport but apart from that the public transport is very use by people of all ages. One once I find computers to be great in is originallity. other people prefer to travel by trains as it's faster and more comfortable than cars.Many countries like to travel by bikes in order to decrease the pollution which happened by car exhausted.to my point of view i prefer travelling by cars which is more comfortable. She told me not good at all, but my was good and she also added that you may got the chance and finally I got it.After three days later our result has been published and I got the chance but the girl didn't. Even though do not everyone doing that,so how much public office is care of environment is important and this town is care of that a lot.Every morning some peasons are coming park and cleaned that makes feel really thanksgratitude. that I like. I can also share what I've made so everyone can see it. Or listen to it. In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life, but majority of ones is totally utopic. In conclusion, I think computers are a great tool for use in moderation. Some people who are obsessed, it can be problematic. The reason is the next, three days ago, he was working when a girl of his job asked him whether he had girlfriend and he told, I had one, come on you know my ex-girlfriend then she only walked without tell nothing."	2

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"An day in the morning Paxton waited to Long y the writer, but he listened that called him suddenly he goes for the beach and is killed for the shadow Authors, artists, phtographers, etc. so, i`m rely thinking left this sport.Everyday i get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends.i`m exercising more and more again to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world.i`m champion in my sport so, i`m seek to do all my effort to be the first one in the world.finally I did not find encourage of my family or my teachers. Why should the consumers not have the same right to choose what they expose themselves to? in my personal obinionits better to lern froma teacher not only dat you lern to pronounce the words correctly you also lern from a personwhat is in my opinion way better i thin k we spend enougth time on smart phones so i dont think its the best if we use them to lern as well. public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it is kind of becoming cheaper and also more safe but some  people prefer cars to extent do we agree with and what is our reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay  before about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was not even good facility to move from place to other and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans at the beginning the faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve it by the end nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and planes .some people prefer cars because the do like crowded places or because the find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places  to summaries it is different from some oneis opinion to another i predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end cars will disappear and will will no longer be used If a parent really abhors a certain genre, then it is up to that parent to create a surrounding in which they feel that their child is safe. It is true that we are a lot of users that want to use the car but, and that amount is  growing up; as well there are a lot of people that don't have the posibility to have a car and some use the public transportation because many reasons like the price, because it is easier to get to the place by public transportation rather than car, because the traffic, some times for people it is so exhausting to drive lots of hours an even some times the public transportation is faster. In my experience, I know that when I was to young to understand the happenings of @NUM1, my parents intercepted the stories from me. However, I think the tools should be improved, such as killer’s knife and actors'costumes, the knife looks like as brittle as a handicraft, I believe those are seconded-handed clothing. The other matter is about our habit to eating food together with our family that were a custom in humanity life not just in our culture,but now because of hard and busy life ,we had to eat our meal  mostly days of a week. after that the celebration was began and a lot of their friends have attended each one presented a gift for Sara , she was very delighted and suddenly the doorbell been rang  she was her old friend Tia .

There is a maturity level that goes into making descisions on your own; if you are mature anough to decide who you want to run your country, how could you not be mature enough to decide something as insignificant as music choice? Authors, artists, composers, and phtographers, all by living in @LOCATION1, all have the right to the freedom of speech and freedom of expression. my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long. However the best option is that you came here and after I present my friends and their fathers because they can help with your job. Every month Huang Ji Huang always make a special offer from their cutomer , and for this month Huang Ji Huang will give 20% discount for customer who spend 500 IDR above, for a complete  informatioj you can check it on the website or call the restaurant. Why should the government have total control over the @CAPS1 are exposed to? If this were to happen, could it easily be taken too far by power hungry poloticians? If difficulties was told to the families, the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation. American prides itself in being a 'mixing pot', and being accepting. If @LOCATION1 were to be like @LOCATION2, that would mean the restriction of expression and originailty throughout the country. This book made me interesting and I begging reading more and more while I read the more I love it  this time everything  did not matter to me I want to finish the book  as soon as possible I do not know the end but I want the end of the book was amazing but the same time I do not finish the book because the mystery to open up finished in. Would you be proud to live in a place where people don't have the opportunity to express themselves to others freely? I wouldn't. I know that I am a suitable person for this job, and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job, because I have been travelled for all the world and in this experience, I have seen in the necesity on work to fiance my journey, so the I have dedicated to work on summer camps, and I have a lot of experience in this. It is discrimination agaisnt composers of a certain genre of works. It is the removal of choice from @CAPS1' lives. It is denying the composers their right to freedom of speech. We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben, which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye.To got to the Big Ben we took the underground, but to get to the London Eye a red bus.After 3 days we went home.I forgot to tell you something about homeless people.A lot of people are homeless, which is sad, but maybe we can change it."	2
247	"If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"While I were in ANDRAPRADESH every year we have Christmas function in December although we are not interested to attend Drama they were not leave us without participation even simple character.They gave me a character like THE GOD .Firstly I never aware about how act and do this particular character.And from October to till December we practise everyday after our study hour up to eleven ""O""CLOCK.DAY BY DAY  I learn and finally I did my role well.Then I think myself why I wasted all my school days . Since both side have advantages and also disadvantages, it is hard to choose one of them. Some people insist that inexperienced workers with low salary are better to hire, I argue that experienced workers with high salary are much better to hire. First of all, people who believe that low salary workers are better insist that the low salary workers are better only because they can save money through low salary. This perspective of life is inspired by contracultural movements and some people call to these people as “alternative”, but it is each day more common and it let a inclusive and diverse society. When we hire a experienced worker, we can save time for employees to get used to their jobs. At that time they can do their jobs and make more money. One thousand people by eighteen and more are questions in my town about their way takes care of the environment.Investigation reveals the youngsters are more than ever power to  save the world from waste and pollution. This sport cause fresh and jolly me and I think will exercise cause healthy.if you start volleyball, you need a ball and piece of ground that separate with tie. For example, there are two hamburger restaurant. I love my small family.My family members are very helpful and supportive.My parents are very support.My parents are my best friends and guides.If any problems faced ,i'm went to my parents and say the problem,there are solve the problem.My family is my world.My parents are the good guides.There are my role model.some times we were go to the tour programs,it's very happy moments.My mammy told the story in night.Mom make the special foods in festivals. In contrast, Restaurant B has an experienced worker who takes minutes to make a high quality hamburger and if you ask some question about restaurant, answer to all of your question. Customers would like the B restaurant and B might earn money. On one hand you put all your things in the car and drive anywhere you want to, on the other hand if you feel not very well to drive, you have no money to buy a car or the downtown of your city is closed for all the means of transport except for the public ones: tram, bus or trolley bus is your wayout. They know the problems of the company because they worked at similar job or same company for long years. There are many accidentally problems encountered by international students studying in Australia.It is believed that the most important one of the problem is culture barrier.Because of different culture backgrounds,the talking  style of internaional students who come from different countries are various. These answers to the question may result in increase of the quality of company and this company might become a better one when employer accept them. As aforementioned paragraph precisely describe, I want my employees to become more professional. I do prefer workers with many experience and low salary but these workers do not exist in real world. I will tell you a review of a thriller, the thriller is Hunger games it is about some capitals and people are choised and play on a game, you have to kill persons for they don't kill you, is a movie that have suspense because you want to know ho survey, in the movie someone love someone and protect each others, is very cute but on the 3 movies they are bad moments with the family, capitals, Friends, etc. Which one do you prefer?"	2

For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"Hi, Jenny Well, as you asked me Jenny, the most brilliant actor than see before is Vin Deasel, it is an excellent professional and he protagonized a great deal of movies like the saga of Fast and Furious, Ridic , Nannies bulletproof and other extras films. I knew @CAPS9 they were about to tell me. so, i`m rely thinking left this sport.Everyday i get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends.i`m exercising more and more again to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world.i`m champion in my sport so, i`m seek to do all my effort to be the first one in the world.finally I did not find encourage of my family or my teachers. In my opinion ,Volleyball must then be considered among high-risk sports according to the frequency and gravity of our surgical findings.my advice for who starts this sport you will get fresh after you play this game and makes you doing your work in relaxetion way . They were getting a divorce @CAPS11 the time to tell me had come. As each of my parents gathered around me, I knew that they were about to say something I wasn't ready to hear. In all over the world people always need advices to keep looking after their environments .First ,the municipal should do workshops in schools and universities providing students by tips that should help us to make our environment clean .Second ,they should make awareness campaigns about environment ;for example , telling people to put their rubbish in waste papre basket which helping workers to recycling it easily .Finally ,to stay healthy we need a healthy environment . Michael and Kate was so  happy, until one day that Michael said to him dream to be a super hero, Kate get so nervous saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid dream and that Michael was only dreaming but that would never happen and that super hero don’t exist. But that was the exact opposite of @CAPS9 was going on right now. Above all,the design is the most previous way we should know,which is considered with the background color and artwork.Secondly,we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinsts.And the we need printing and inspection.Eventually,the most essential part comes out,we need significate the quality of the sheets.If it's good,packing and distributin whereas the others shoulde be distroyed as well. I choose the wheel because is the most useful invention ever because thanks to it the human works make easier by example a way to move heavy objects, compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today the wheel was invented at a relatively late point of human history, he oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia. i dont think the public transport does not have future, there are a lot of people who can not buy a car and has to use the communite transport. But she is boyfriend live upstate and hasn’t got a airport he’s of city because of that she was need choose by train. When alison knock on his parents door she noticed that there were many people in her parents house, a man open the front door.When she entered  the house ,a man was looking at her with a bad face,when suddenly this man shot with a gun to Alison father. In my opinion, public transport in my country will never improve because my country is so poor and beside it is considered one of third world countries and another think must be taken into consideration is they the politicians are horrible they have destroyed my country I got that one parent would move away, that I wouldn't always get tucked into bed at night by a duo of love, I just didn't understand @CAPS7 this had to happen. My poor little brother. Only four, how could they possibly explain this to him. Coat of arms of the city of Rybinsk is a scarlet heraldic shield,over which - green with golden beach pier for which the output is black rebelling bear holding in the left leg on the left shoulder golden ax, undertwo silver starlet When I was returning from syleth I called the girl and talk to her and assure that I got chance in university but girl says that she knew it. I wanted to go far, far away from the troubles occurring at home. The other chart is about employer support, under 26 years old is the most higterst because it almost have 70%, the scentd higterst is age 26-29 years old; it has 50% of people are taken; niy yhe most lower is 35% age of group are 30-39 years old. I bought shoes, clothes and GPS watch,I told myself:now it is a challenge, I must defeat myself .The first day is so painful, I was tired to die when I just ran nearly 3km, but things becomes better and better, and now I could run 10km. @CAPS7 did they think those statements made @CAPS6 better? Because @CAPS6 really didn't help. My parents had fallen out of love with each other, @CAPS11 the hope I had that they would get back together was diminishing faster than the amount of rain forest left in @LOCATION1. I used all of the things except two.I didn't have the Internet when I was child.And also we couldn't choose  programmes.I played in the street and walked to school alone.I'm thinking what kind if things were more dangerous for me?It was so dangerous when my friends and I swam in the Tobol river.We jumped into the water and caught crayfish.When I remember that moment I am exciting.I guess everychild want to investigate the world.We have to help them,to show and explain.What kind of risks they can get if to do that. @CAPS11 more importantly than my home, my heart. You should knew about the prize for coming to the museum is very cheap ($15.00) for hour if you want to stay more time the prize increase in $10.00. Then ,preparation of mental plates and skilled machinists are the needments.Printing is the next step ,.Usually ,sheets of bank notes printed ,because there are some special require for the printing ,solour of both sides,special ink ,images slightly raised. ""@CAPS8 @CAPS3 feel like crying, laugh. Remember all the good times that we spent together as afamily."" One by one, each memory began to flood back into my mind. @CAPS8 dad jumped into the pile of leaves we had collectively raked. Some public transports  as trains do not contaminate as cars or motorbikes.Many people said that public transport is not confortable, thats true, from my point of view bus is not so unconfortable. @CAPS11 especially the wedding that brought the two of them together in matrimony. That sacred bond that only ministers can ensue on people. Firstly, Django Unchained remembered us the hard life suffered by black people in the past, due to a great introduction without dialogues, where black people were unchained while they came back to be selling to an owner farm, it being matching with an amanzing soundtrack as identity Tarantino´s films. I began to laugh, @CAPS11 then to cry. My parents weren't sure @CAPS9 to think about my sudden change of emotion. While I were in ANDRAPRADESH every year we have Christmas function in December although we are not interested to attend Drama they were not leave us without participation even simple character.They gave me a character like THE GOD .Firstly I never aware about how act and do this particular character.And from October to till December we practise everyday after our study hour up to eleven ""O""CLOCK.DAY BY DAY  I learn and finally I did my role well.Then I think myself why I wasted all my school days . @CAPS11 I, still thinking that none of these memories would be had again, I then realized something. The film is a romantic movie, It is talking about one man, Noa, who lives in a small shore town when he felt in love with a rich girl, but like always the girl´s parents did not like Noa´s life because the girl´s father thinks that Noa is not enough good for their daughter. That @CAPS8 someone slipped on a piece of paper, @CAPS6 would be funny. My tears had stopped spewing out of my eyes like a dam in desperate need of repair, @CAPS11 the realization had finally set in that we would be okay. We as a human who live in these days , we live rely on technolgy, every aspect of our live are supporting by technolgy. people ,espicially grnerator's owner, start using Canaopies, using very long pipes to get rid off as possible as they can from the polution. television entertains as well as it will educate the people.These days are educating themselves by watching the television.Televison not only provide entertainment it will give lots of information about the happenings around the globe.Channels like national geographic and animal planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origination of species.Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people The statement that said to me, @CAPS6's okay to be sad, but that as long as @CAPS3 have laughter in your life, everything @CAPS1 be alright. n the town he tries that the people have to aware about the sitiations and they take care  the environment   On the other hand, the ask is if this solution could be enough or no. If @CAPS6 had not been for her, I would of kept on with the water works @CAPS11 never stopped for just a second to think about all the hilarious times we had had together. So, as far as laughter goes, don't forget to just take a moment out of every day to remember each punch line to every corny joke, @CAPS6 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4."	2
249	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in @NUM3 grade go on the computer each night to complete homework and to connect with friends and family? I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. I studied in Kuwait schools , after that I joined Damascus university , the faculty of human medicine , I graduated from it in 2008 with very good grade , then I got the Master's degree in laboratory medicine from the same university (Ministry of Higher Education ) in 2013 with Excellent grade . Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life. This town is located in the central zone of the Afghanistan with 4462(km²) space, and has more than seven Million populations, the economic and security situation is not suitable and these factors have directly effect in to the carefulness of environment. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. As every year the twenty three of April, day of book, in my school all the student of fifth and sixth of primary do short story competition and the winner have a gift. Then ,the notes will be prepared with metal plates .After that ,printing ,the notes will be printred in colour on  both sides with special ink and it will images sightly raised . This helps people stay connected. My name is shousheng and live in Montreal Canada.Alrough Canada is an English country however in Montreal, the offical language is Freach. Above all,the design is the most previous way we should know,which is considered with the background color and artwork.Secondly,we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinsts.And the we need printing and inspection.Eventually,the most essential part comes out,we need significate the quality of the sheets.If it's good,packing and distributin whereas the others shoulde be distroyed as well. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben, which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye.To got to the Big Ben we took the underground, but to get to the London Eye a red bus.After 3 days we went home.I forgot to tell you something about homeless people.A lot of people are homeless, which is sad, but maybe we can change it. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. while we are spendind good time watching TV our brain is not in calm, only in an other position different to that ones in the rest od the day.That's why I think that it's a good momento to see the thing through a new glass and that can be a very high opportunity. This is teaching them hand-eye coordiantion, and how to type. The computer is not @CAPS5 used for just communication. It's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. ""@CAPS6 and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy, ""says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. But in some day tow guise with quad bike and they saw some thing wrong they sad what's that , they sow dead body , they skared and run to ther camp . Everyone eagerly waiting for the ambulance arrival but still not yet reached the reason is our college location is little far from the city that's why it is getting late. Further to the trade fair of the last week where we were a pleasure to meet you and we were talking about you courses. Dear Sir or Madam Reference to your advertisement I would like to apply for the position to work in AMERICAN SUMMER CAMPS,I am John from  the capital city of south state in India, I worked in middle aged  school for about 2 years, where I had experience which will be suitable for the current position. I want to turn to his hobbies, when he isn't working, he is riding on a bike, every evening he takes the bike and rides across some paths for more than forty kilometers by day, so he is very good rider and its quite strong to ride with him. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. I think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone."	2

"The innovation of computers was a great leap into discovery. Unfortunately, the negative aspects of this magnificent invention detract from the novelty. first my favorite sport is futboll and i like for many reasons for example while you are watching a match you´re going to feel exited and entretaining besides that fubol has the best fotboll player than ever who is leo mesy he's the best and he s able to awesome stuff when he´s playing. looking at the information in more detail.Initially,bank note should be considered the design such as background colour ,artwork,and security issues.then,the preparation of metal plates is next stage.bank note should be skilled and machinists.thereafter,this stage is printing .worker should pay attention to colour on both sides,special ink , and images slightly raised. Negaticvs about the online lerning are dat your not listening to much from ea real person and more from a Computer, if you dont have any listening things in the app you dont lern how to pronounce the words. Environmental changes really need in the current situation.People contribuation is very important in this matter.The report explains how my town people taking care of my surroundings and to preserve this planet in a betterway. Apart from that you see new places and you have fun, you also lern others cultures, historicals facts, you also lern to respect others peoples and thirs costums. Indeed, for some the addiction is awful enough that the person only moves to get food, use a restroom, go to bed or when a parent demands it. All of the day's food settles into the stomach and little to none of it is burned off. Meanwhile, in some of the more severe cases the person is so entranced that bedtimes are pushed later. Tennis, tennis is not jsut a sport anyone can play but it's professional sport needs to more hard trainee and more time to be perfect in it, in first why I choose tennis?, seriously in 2003 this is my first time to watch the game on TV when I saw roger federer played I think he is the one that made me love this sport, due to it's professional motion in playing the ball, from this time I was interested in this game and watching all championship, so more time, time and time it was my favoirite sport. Nowadays the computer detracts from the sleep and exercise that the body requires. Even nature suffered from the advent of computers. I screamed, my anger had dominated my mind i didnt had no longer control over my actions, i was afarid of what i had become and what i could do, but i could not control my self and the only thing i could think of was him suffering with a slow death and the satisaction i would feel when i finally had my revange, the best revange. This major involves all, always we have to consider the all possibilities to resolve  homework , you have to know the most possible information for can resolve it. Oftentimes parallels can be drawn between the wild and the tamed. Attached as people are to computers, they cannot experience the world to the fullest. There are many accidentally problems encountered by international students studying in Australia.It is believed that the most important one of the problem is culture barrier.Because of different culture backgrounds,the talking  style of internaional students who come from different countries are various. The experience is not the same. Invention of car has made people's lives easier.No more they have to solely depend on public transport.Though public transport are cheaper and one could get to know many companions ,increase network.But public transport has fixed schedule and on a rushing day not many can really enjoy their journey. I have played this sport for twelve years ago this sport has taught me to respect the other not assault to him.there is the only reason that makes me choose this sport is I don't want to be weak I wouldn't like to be nothing in this country that has a rule Strong dominated the weak.when I put my feet in the gym i forget everything shcool,home...therefore I enjoy it.I can't imagine my life without taekwondo it is my blood,my soul.taekwondo it is not a violent sport as many people say but what you have to know is what in the brain and the heart of players.I just get the 1st degree international black belt and I would like to tell to anyone he just starting this sport use your abilities and skills for the right things. Reduce the fast food that make people obese and not healthy.It will be better if you gave drinks compared to the weather like whenever its winter we would like a hot drink and if it is summer we would like a chilled drink. Even family and friends suffer when computers are around. Many people barely pay attention to conversation while focusing on the screen. They tend to onlypretend to listen half the time. At first, I had called a travel agent but he said he couldn’t be able to book me a flight before two months, so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent. Frequently, during conversations without a computer nearby, the mind is focused on something from earlier that day. Relationships are suffering, and computers are at fault. Computers are sucking in society, more of it each day. Much of what is done on computers, like the study of faraway places, can easily be found in books. I don't think there is no future for public transport.Especially in urban, for example, Taipei city in Taiwan.People who lives there almost know the convenient public transport called MRT, it's fast, cheaper and doesn't have to find the parking lot. Through all of this, they have returned little to society. Why does the world continue to put up with computers and their negative effect on humanity?"	2

On the rest of the boring week, I was watching TV and suddenly my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet, so I decided to solve my Paris puzzles with my sister, which was less than a half solved for about one year but it had too much color in the sky so I didn't finished then a year ago. According to the information donne, the most used is the car thus most of the families has one, but the public transportation is getting more and more common for those ones who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectfully with the planet. Nowadays a person's worth seems to be judge  according to the social status and material possessions, that is mostly to happen in high class famiies, as they are foccus on achievements as power, political influences etc. Altogether I had a very enriching experience being a private tutor, as I loved learning and academia in general, and in the process I developed important interpersonal communication skills, for example being articulate and patient. Of course, having a stable source of income did not hurt either."	2
252	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"However we the people have really important part of making it worse.Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh, clean and safe environment to their people.Recycling item can be a good step to start with clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking care by my city.Everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of province government.People is not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere. Computers have a very positive effect on people, such as informing them on news, traffic, and weather right away, interacting with others, and learning new facts. In conclusion, we are assisting to a new tend in transport, every time, they are faster and more developer, with the latest technology included but at the oppossite case, we find also a contradiction, as we found an other trend for the tradictional transport which avoid the pollution in order to respect the Earth They are a daily tool that millions of people use positively. One way that people use computers positively is by using it to be informed by news, traffic, and weather. For example, say there are signs of a hurricane going to hit near their homes. My name is Anna,I am a very cheerful person and I have a creative personality so I enjoy planning activities or organise sport events in a special and  colorful way.I really love childrens and take care of them ,I also had an experience  of working in summer camps and have a good experience doing delicious food because I already did this stuff in other camps.I think that I gave good reasons and I hope that you will accept me. I like a car as well,but when I have to driving a car I have to think about parking a lot and I can't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am having travel,so the public transport is making connection with human beings.It is why I think public transport is really important for public and there are a lot of important thing is having a possble in the future. People would be well aware of the facts by reading an article online. Computers help by informing people about danger so they and their families are not harmed not only doe computers help inform people about any danger through news and weather, but @CAPS4 their daily lifestyle. My father drives into work every morning, and is always looking online for any traffic updates so he can avoid them and get to work on time and safely, without computers people would be unable to know directly the harms and difficulties they @MONTH1 face. Fortunately  Kabul structured  by Mountains and have mountainous climate, approximately this town  have 15 (mm) Raining per year the remarkable Agricultural area and forestry all around the town have a positive effect for the Kabul city environment and producing  Fresh air for the citizens of the mentioned town It helps to make people more social, by chatting with their friends. Another example is, say you haven't seen a close family member or friend in a long time. Video chatting and instant messaging will help you catch up and develop a stronger realationship nobody wants to waste time in life not speaking for a long period of time to a close friend or family member, right? the first day we went to Taormina and Giardini Naxos, the day after we visited Siracusa, the third day Agrigento and The valley of the temples and the last day we saw Marsala and Trapani. Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe, in fact there is some important tournament where participate all important Europe team,They are called ""Champions League"" and ""Europa League"".football is a team sport in fact in this sport participate everyboby without exclude nobody. I reduce use of innecesary power at home, in other words,I turn on light that I need for the while i use it;I take less warm shower; I hit only neccesary rooms. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""Computers are what helps my students grow. I have them use computers everyday for reports and to extend their learning"". They are @CAPS4 helpful to students because the internet now contains textbooks they use in class. That way, the won't need to lug around heavy books, and strss out for forgetting them, @CAPS4, if the student doesn't understand material learned in class, they can look online for extra help and guidance, malking their knowledge grow further. Adolescent has always been the hardest part throughout anybody's whole life.. turning out in a fleeting glimpse into an adult, perceiving the other side of life,how tough and complicated it is, trying to deal with its different circumstances.. at this point you merely have a brief look at your whole life, many questions spinning in your head, accusing yourself of being a lost cause, wishing if you could turn the clock back,,but it's all no good.. then you find yourself standing ahead clouds of reality, which sucks.. life is stages, this stage of your life is timeless, no way out.. at some point you wish if it was all illusio, you need a time machine makes it possible to go back in time when you could see the purity of life.. However..here you are completely different made of life lessons, preferring to make a stiff upper lip..cowering in your own reality. I think that the  public  transport always going to be so important in our life  because  not all the people have the possibility to buy a car because the public transport is more expensive than a car, so for that reason the public transport in the future  could be exist, because public transport is a necesity in all the world not only for the money but too for the facility to take a bus or any other public transport The biggest anecdote, that I have with my friend, was our trip to Disney world.Where we could visit all the parks of Disney , like Animal Kingdom ,Hollywood studios and Magic kingdom.In adittion we could visit others parks, like Universal and Bush Garden."	2
253	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"We can really confirm that there is no future for public transport, if so, we will have to drive a car instead of buying a ticket for public transport and go to office, city, home and so on using private transport, however we can also think that in the centre has no parking car or it is not enough for the whole private car, thereby, if we use a public transport, we can simplify our lives and spend less simply because we are able to save money and time. There are best professors, new experiment machines, and various supporting systems. However, kaist students generally feel one problem while studying here, meal. There are several problems in our meal system, and I think we should make more restaurants to solve this problem. I had a terrible experience in this Chinese New Year!Because Norovirus infected me!At first,I had a high fever but I thought if I take some medicine I will be fine.Therefore,my condition took a sharp turn for the worse.I cannot eat anything even in New Year's Eve and I was so tired that I cannot play poker with my cousins.Though everythings were depressing,I still have a wonderful winner vacation with my family:we went to  Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village(九族)to visited its blooming cherry blossom. There are about 3000 people in university, but there are only 3 restaurants inside school. Because of this, lots of people come to restaurant and makes a long line at lunch or dinner time. Environment is the sorrounding.there is no aleartness in our locality.they were busy in their own work.everyone were not focus or see what hapening in our place.they use to speak about how hot today is?but they dont know what makes this much hot.iam interest in planting tree and makes sorrounding clean.some people used to burn forest as if those forest is useless.man are greedy  because of all the thing  getting from the forest are free. Therefore, they only have one hour to have a lunch. Michael is a good boy and he always listen to his mother .on time Michael was very angry as he got a bad score in his test .when he was home his mother was cooking she asked him what is the wrong ? In these diagrams below,the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly.The first step,the bank notes should be desinged concidering some constructions,like background color,artwork and security issues,After it was prepared,skilled machinists would make preparaation of metal plates in the second step.Then,sheets of bank notes would be printed by 50 bank notes per sheet,which have colour imagines on both sides in special ink.After printing well,these sheets would be manually inspected closely.It was the most important step during the whole processing.And then,some  sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets  which would be cut into and separated into equal ones andpacked and depatched to where they are demanded. i like volei because it was part of my life and of life of my mother, is my favorite sport, but i like over sports too, same i don't play volei because I'm bad, and my friends that know, don't like of  peoples bad of volei.I'm watching they playing, they're really very good, but when play over school, they're very bad There are 3 restaurants and places like Lotteria or Subway, but they are spread in school. Because school is big and students don't have much time, they can only eat what they usually eat from next to their class or dorm. This make students not to be happy for meal, and to think about various food they want to eat. In those days almost 80% of people have assured feel preocupation about their bodies and their alimentation, for this they convidenced me that they will try improve their habitual alimentation everyday and their will do sport more frequently. My favorite way to travel is the Plane because  I like to be fast and in my life, I hate a wait in my opinion the plane is the best for me for example when you want to go  somewhere you need to reach there so quick , you don't need to take time and The plane is the best travelling in the world that the best safer than other way  , you can see on the pollution of people who got an accident , how often an accident happen by the plane so anyway if it's happen,i can't imagine it , Eventually I wish everyone who like to travel is safe and sound and safe journey. my favourite sport is swimming , it makes me feeling comfortable and left me in a good mood , i go to swim twice a week , and my advice to anyone want to start to enjoy every moment of it Finally, restaurants except for big 3 ones don't provide enough meal. Michael decided to open the door and back for her, he thought better the things he do not want to leave her again, he like her, he knows himself and he wants to know her, he have kept all his feelings for a long time. However if this situation not change and if our government not take providence about this important subject will be the end of the transport public and will more convenient to use car. However, these sandwiches are too small for students to be full. Coat of arms of the city of Rybinsk is a scarlet heraldic shield,over which - green with golden beach pier for which the output is black rebelling bear holding in the left leg on the left shoulder golden ax, undertwo silver starlet There were restaurants which sell ttukbegi(korean food) or big kimbab in past. My favorite sport is swimming.I engaged in swimming in nine years old.I had gotten first prize in a match.As a result,I think that I have some intellent on swimming.Since then,I meet my teacher in the pool.She teach me a lot of things,and be the most important figure in my life.She is a doctor,she told me that swimming will let my body more better.From then on,I fell my disease in decreasind and fell relax.Consequently,I need to swim usually. We need more restaurants like this to get enough food. For this reasons, more restaurants are needed in Kaist. I reduce use of innecesary power at home, in other words,I turn on light that I need for the while i use it;I take less warm shower; I hit only neccesary rooms. Deliver is not also a way to solve this problem. Meal is one of the most important problems to students because this can also affect the efficiency of study. If there are enough restaurants in school, students will happily have meals and study better, and become  better researchers."	2

They are an amazing marvel of science that greatly benefits man-kind today. Some people say that a tripp by car is more convenient that by the public transportation, but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations.It is true that travel to a nearby place from your city, it  is more comfortable getting there by car, and the ease of have your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time paying  cabs. people that they play in this categorie are fameous althoug you can see them on tv.if you want to be a big football player you must to practise more time and yoor life should to be healthy. The service is very bad the drivers are very angry and stressed out these do not lead with cauition, in Toluca exist report of high rates of accidents by buses. I would like to say for anyone wants playing soccer to be very careful when he plays it because it may cause a lot of injures ,but in the same time it is very nice game. For example, the search engine, @ORGANIZATION1, is an easy to use website that can be very helpful. If there is a concept or problem that you are having trouble with, just type it into @ORGANIZATION1 and links to websites pop up that will help answer anything that you would like to know. Transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible This website is an all purpose dictinary, @CAPS2, encyclopedia and translator. I even have an application for it on my cellphone. He is hobbies  listen to music, play  computer game, watch the football match and watch  TV. Social networking websites, like facebook, games websites like @CAPS3, and also websites like @CAPS4 can be very tempting and distracting when you should be doing homework. Procrasination is very easy to give into. She always tell me some jokes but some times i laughed !,i love her so much,i don't know how will my world being like without her and i won't to know . Transportation is very important in cities,villages as well as in sub-lines.Many people has no vehicles,they only depends on public transport due to some reasons.Any way in some cases,car is very useful to reach the destination very fast. One of the example is television, in the past we use it only for watching news and movie, but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t, now television has others function. We are lucky enough today that most large books can be formated onto a computer. Instead of carrying a @NUM1-pound text book, you can just use a @NUM1 megabyte book on the internet. This makes travel to and from school much easier. First, you should know is the weather, we have a very cold winter and a hot summer compared with the other countries in the middle east.If you want a city with sea you should choose any city in the west or east of Saudi Arabia.Riyadh is the capital City it's in the center of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.All the stores and malls are closed at mid night include the five prays breaks because we need to go for pray for work you need to know what the major you want to work in so I can help you to search for a good job matching you abilities. in modern day there is very little public transpotr are used,ganeral public prefer much faster and conveninece  ways of traveling  around.though the pulic transport are used in mager citys to avoied traffic conjustion,it is wlidly reconizge that public transport are eco friendly. The island was flood but the island had a levee that prevent a flooding then in many year a engineers star constructing a building to had more money then in the city put many advertising in all thing : ball, balloon, movies ,etc. But this can also keep us from going outside, excersising, and seing real people in real life. This need for the computer can be bad. The social networks such as: Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,Google plus... are connecting  us to more and more friends, companies, public figures, books, films, social organizations...we are really have many things to see, to think, to ""like"", to ""comment"" and a dozen of stuffs that we can make an action to interactive with others...so may it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves, to take care our healthy. Its  popularity spreads all over world too.There are many reasons behind it to be popular.Everyone is able to enjoy the excitement throughout of this game the session.The people who eager to play football must follow some basic rules which are described below: 1.A football player should be punctual and hard-working. For other hand, People make other inventions for improving the world and reduce pollution, for example, In this time we have created electric cars or organic food, these things are very useful in future, because we will need to reduce pollution. Facebook, for instance, is very addicting. You are looking at a virtual landsacape. This first reason is all actors shown their talent in this film directly and audience can follow their steps and the story certainly, this essential element which also makes a big success to the film. Overall, computers are great, but you have to know when, and how long to use it. It has several benefits such as entertainment, communication, and information. But all of these things can be just as distracting as they can be helpful. Sometimes, some tv shows are so great that helps you in determinate class,for example, Animal Plante can help you in biology, The History can help in history, etc... In my opinion the television can be good as books, and can also be a form of learning as good as only reads books, because TV is something fun, so you can learn and have fun at the same time. I hope that society can think of the pros and cons of the computer."	2
255	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"one day Micheal wanted to go out from his home so he called his besfriend an suggested to go out togther , his friend agreed , so Michael weared his closes , wnet out and closed the door but at this moment he knew he had made a mistake . Of course, it seems to relieve their mind to smoke cigarette. Sometimes the employers do strike and we clients do not known in time as a result we can not get on time to work,that is one of the disadvantages of using public transport. I think that smoking should be completely banned at public place in country. There are some reasons supporting my idea. This experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister (I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money. When i was arrived at home, i was started to read the news paper, so i found from there The International Student Magazine have to organize a short story competition, and I decide to call Michael to tell him about this contest. Second, to smoke a cigarette cost a lot of social expense. The survey of the Ministry of Health and Welfare shows that smoking area is the most expensive money to clean the surroundings because of time and employee. I believe that the people in a future they will begin to travelling shared car more time and they use less the public transport as the train, the bus, underground, etc. According to the National Emergency Management Agency, it says that fire in restaurant is caused by the light of a cigarette thrown away carelessly. There are many sports grounds for example tennis cort,football grounds and play equipment for child so I think my town takes care of environment that makes everyone will be able to best condition in both mind and body long time. To our relief,she was saved and when we went to granny room,we saw smile on her face.We were also happy,but in Michael head came a lot of things.He knew that if we escape at that moment when the granny was at the ground,she would most probably die.Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake."	2

"First of all,we should thinking out a design and dicide the background colour and artwork,or even security issues.And then for the preparation of metal plates ,the skilled and machinists is considerate.Nect,printing,sheets of bank notes printed (50 bank notes per sheet)colour on both sides,and specWell,the most important step is inspection,we should printed sheets manually inspected. This wonderful network is here in our computers. Computers benefit society because they help @CAPS3 connect with far-away places, develop hand-eye coordination and get work done faster. In the days before computers we were isolated in our immediate area. In other way, I never be a witness , what I have to do?, tell me what cain of suit have the witnees have to wear, If I have to buyany colour of tie, the flower.... really I'm very exciting with your wedding. @PERCENT1 of money donated to @ORGANIZATION1 an organization that assists in global disasters comes from online. When he was just about cursing the final line he got hurt and his mussels was dying and star to peel off a black matter, at that point the guys in suit thought that he won’t be able to cross the line , but when they saw that he kept running, they freeze the time and run after him, he stopped for a moment but then , he start running again and when he cross the line he woke up in a red somber fluid, he was wiped out from the matrix, he opened his eyes and saw a flying robot, suddenly he was on a wood wheelchair and they said that he would never be able to walk again , besides that, he stands up and tried to walk again. Travelling by using any transport has become in one of our needs, in the past people used to take hours waiting for the public transport, now, we can afford any of those modern car at the agency. Three robots in specific hour make a show with instruments like a band.Foxy the pirate makes a show individually in her pirate cove, The children loves Foxy because plays with the kids making questions about the pirates and count a pirate story. The gym has many problems that we are gouing to explain : the first problem is that we don´t have enough aparatous for all of the students  the second problem is about that same aparatous are not working well because the school didn´t the manteinace long time ago For the first problem in my opinion , the school have to buy some others aparatus because there are not enough for all of the students For the second problem the solution for me is to hire someone to do the maintenance and say to all of the students to take care of the machines of the school I hope my proposal wiil be useful for you I look forward to hearing from you soon Sebastián Ferrari The computer's intricate experience helps future engineers or even pilots develop a focus and hand-eye coordination that could save lives. However if this situation not change and if our government not take providence about this important subject will be the end of the transport public and will more convenient to use car. In addition, stress is a clear disadvantage of compete because competitiors are trying to win and this can frustrates.But, some people do not think this like this and take it more simply Finally, I think that to compete in sports has some benefits and disadvantages, but when is controlated there are some benefits that help you to whole you life. he states. ""@CAPS4 soldiers have excellent eyes for controls and amazing reflexes, making them natural pilots."" @CAPS5't our community have the opportunity to excel as well? the actions of this film took place in Alexandrie city of Egypt and it talks about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they didn't have much money to produce their own albums , that sort of bands is   famous between the youth and they call it ""under ground bands "" .their songs give a big concenet to the political and social stituation in Egypt and they become famous after the25 january revoulation , why I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society , there is no chance for the youth and if they found it , they face lot of problems to save it and they didn't find time for other activties and in sometimes they worked in thing which  they never learn or love now days, there are many type of transport in the world ,bus taxi,train but train more conform then else , I always used bus in city. Before computers @CAPS7 and calculating took @PERCENT2 more time but now they get our work done quickly and without error. @NUM1 year old author @PERSON2 states ""@CAPS4 computer helps me type @CAPS4 writing a lot faster and it is done right more importantly."" @CAPS7 and typing is just more efficent when you are using a computer accountants, students and even the journalists for your own newspaper need the computer to work faster and more efficently. This sport cause fresh and jolly me and I think will exercise cause healthy.if you start volleyball, you need a ball and piece of ground that separate with tie. Computers are too important and beneficial to lose. It is very difficult to deny the importance of family in our life,  definitely families play an essential role community structure .According to the experts we can't create  successful society without creative families , and one another specific part of your life is a good partners surrounding your daily activities. So explain in your next article that we need our computers. Computers are necessary in our community and we would be last without them!"	2
257	"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"""@CAPS1 to @CAPS2"" @CAPS3 you ever seen the little signs that say, ""@CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS2""? People often @CAPS3 them in their homes as a reminder on how one should @CAPS4 their life. I want to say something about the learning of the English Languaje, is hard to get to me for the next reasons: First reason; the grammar that the learners, teachers or institutes teach, is  like the Spanish Languaje, my native Languaje. Laughter keeps the soul young, the heart happy, and the spirit joyful. Without laughter, one @MONTH1 feel that they @CAPS3 an emptiness inside that they are unable to fill. To begin with,the format of the bank notes needs to be designed,factors of considerations including the background colour,the artwork and the security issues.Sencondly,equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps.Thirdly,print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink,where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes. I used all of the things except two.I didn't have the Internet when I was child.And also we couldn't choose  programmes.I played in the street and walked to school alone.I'm thinking what kind if things were more dangerous for me?It was so dangerous when my friends and I swam in the Tobol river.We jumped into the water and caught crayfish.When I remember that moment I am exciting.I guess everychild want to investigate the world.We have to help them,to show and explain.What kind of risks they can get if to do that. So my idea is aii the coutries allthe people stop to use farmland,forest andwetlang to build houses grow more trees portect our world,our homestar! Finally, Taiwan still suffers economic slump, but we have so many businesses likes to innovate, market their product, customers likes to buy it. I am also committed to preparing monthly reports for newspaper supplement “The Voice of Women” which issued by the WATC “Women's Affairs Technical Committee , and I have the cooperation with the Environment and Development the magazine which issued by Center for development work ""Maan"", annd other web sites and news and media organizations. i love my family special my little sister, she has sixteen years old, i consider my best friend because i used to tell her everything of my life. What more could someone want? The weather was always nice and warm as well, so I had no complaints. It was a beautiful evening, my brother, his best friend, and I decided to take the golf carts out for a spin. Although the public transport is slow but it also do not take a long time of people to reach their destination because public transport nowadays are developed more fast and enough. Now, @ORGANIZATION1 must @CAPS3 seen something in the road because he told me to stop, then he hopped out. In a recent time privet transport is more convenient than public transportation,although public transport  like buses, train ,ferries and intercity rail are consuming less time and energy but sometimes its create problems. As I did that, he frantically jumped on the hood like a cat that had just been frightened. I then decided to slam on the brakes, and when that happened, @PERSON1 launched off like a rocket, but then tried to hop back on the hood. We have Eather first than people thanour house.Eather is our home,we all have to protect it.But now people are distroy it.Just for mony for more house but if we destroy it we will all die our money will gone our house will gone we will have nothing.Beside some people destroy farland to build houses but if one day there is no farmland than what should we eat?Nothing at that time we can eat nothing!So what should we do? I would go a few inches or so, then slam on the brakes! At that point I was practically crying from laughing so hard. First of all,swim can help your health.The research declined that swim can decrease disease.Second,swim can relax yourself.When you in the water,you will feel relax.Third,swim can get more friend.You can go to the swimming club,that is a way to meet people with interesting of same.You can try this sport from now on. the movie I´m going to be reviewing is ""the purge""  I actually loved it quite a lot, I just loved all the suspense and the parts they leave you hanging, it´s just way too interesting, the movie is about the american government who annually gives 12 hours where all crime, even murder, is legal, and there are no medical services during that long period of what they call ""the purge"" and anyone can join it, you can kill whoever you want. All I remember hearing was a @CAPS8 @CAPS9! and then a loud shrilll. He was laying face first, cart on his back, and I had no idea what to do! Reduce the fast food that make people obese and not healthy.It will be better if you gave drinks compared to the weather like whenever its winter we would like a hot drink and if it is summer we would like a chilled drink. Nowadays the public transporte isn't hardly necessary for our life.However,a lot cities have a problem about traffic,cause of this trouble that citizen don't use public transporte such as autobus, taxi, or even metro.Consequently,gorvernment start to support and take care of the public transporte. secondly these mode of transportation covers      as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routine who travelled by public transportation.as a consquence generally people avoid travelling by public transportation finally i can say that there are various mode of transporotation avaliable  to competition with public transportation. My brother finally got up and @PERSON1 was yelling, ""@CAPS10't move @CAPS11!"" You can see some store fridge around the market for Drinks and Dairy like milk, yogurt, cheese, butter and cream Also chest freezers for Ice creams .In a corner, they sell cosmetics and a salesperson helps customers to find their required . My brother was trying to tell me that we should lift the heavy cart from his back but in my head, I knew that both of us together wouldn't @CAPS3 been able to do that. it can never be regained even the strongest monarchs have been helpless to prevent time.So should be careful about the importance of time .I hope to not waste it and use it as the best use for giving opportunity for rising .Those who waste it ,will be behind and they will fail to make a mark in their life.The great men and successful guys became fame and rose by a suitable use for time .They guide and source of inspiration for a new generation. Biting down on my lower lip, closing my eyes tightly, I pounded the gas to the ground, flying backwards off of his helpless body. Luckily no damage was done, and @ORGANIZATION1 was perfectly fine. A gigantic weight was lifted from my back and I was able to breathe again. Looking back, I am able to @CAPS2 and joke about that wonderful day that went so wonderfully wrong, though I am very thankful that nothing extremely harmful happened to the poor guy I dreadfully ran over that day. I can tell you one thing, as the day carried on, we had a blast.

Elizabeth apparent to be a very sweet girl, but Jason is not convince, because when he kiss her, he doesn’t feel nothing, he doesn’t feel that gravity disappear, and when his face turn red, he just put a face of horror and surprise , like if she was very sorry about kissing him. It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs.In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us.In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable.

Sometimes, some tv shows are so great that helps you in determinate class,for example, Animal Plante can help you in biology, The History can help in history, etc... In my opinion the television can be good as books, and can also be a form of learning as good as only reads books, because TV is something fun, so you can learn and have fun at the same time. Which I believe was most definitley the right decision. finally ,a public transport need more costs , because public transport (such a buses , train ) fees every year is increasing, and this problem we do not face it by private transport ,"	2
258	Government: Some people think that governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology. Other people disagree and think that this money should be spent on more basic needs. Which of these opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"In modern society, the scale of the computer technology has been constantly increased, and the scale of investment on it also increased. The best season to sale the ice cream from the van is autumn,while that is one of the worst season for indoor swimming pool.The discrepancy of these two place is large.The best sale achievement of the van is 4500,5000,5500respectively. In my opinion, developing computer technology is more important in several reasons. First, development of computer technology can increase efficiency of the entire society. Nowadays, most parts of the society has been automated and mechanized. Moreover, computer technology are used to control those processes; therefore, with better computer technology, the society can not only reduce unnecessary steps, but also create new methods on task. Then peter stared "" happy birthday my lovely sister"" peter said and gave here key of a car Sara was so amazed and hug here brother and grateful him . For example, in past, the idea about artificial intelligence was story of scientific fantasy; but, it became true in the modern society, by development of computer technology. My advice to travel for Spain is that there are several types of transport but the most economic is the public, most expensive transport can be the taxi, for example.But, you can travel by plane,it is not very expensive. I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens.So I do not agree with this afirmation, in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport. For one, the show played on television may enlight us and give us some enlightenment.Teleplay are not just for fun,it can have a deep meaning,short story tells big deal,just like a useful book.So,why not television cannot educate us?"	2

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 a world where no information could be saved for the whole world to observe a place with no communication with loved ones or friends; or a life with no possible way of learning of catastrophe's on the other end of the earth. I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked.Pleasure to work at concerts is when  I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate.The experience  is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert. So if you want to work in Egypt you must have a complete information about the job (location ,salary,incentives, Allowances , work environment,position titles , company type,policy ,mission,vision)                                                                                               With best Wishes                                                                                                Sameh Sabbagh Medicine, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 constructing and revolutionizing our life has been made possible by computers. @PERSON1 is an old family friend of mine. He was one of the few people who was working on going to the moon for the very first time. I love to listen to British English, but it’s really hard to study, all because we are all learning American English in Taiwan, so when I have the opportunity to contact British English, it’s full of tone cadence, always feel particularly charming, and British culture exudes noble temperament, so British accent sounds like there is always an indescribable elegance qualities. But computers made the expirience a reality. @PERSON1 remembered recieving some of the first footage of he moon on to his computer, before the photographs and video are released to the public. However, @PERSON1 is not the only person who agrees. Johnson, a principal from a private school in @LOCATION1, after winning an award for best school in @LOCATION1 states @PERCENT1 of our education comes from the computers. We're looking for a new nice home and so we are truly interested to keep your place tide and take care about it as it were our own. First of all,swim can help your health.The research declined that swim can decrease disease.Second,swim can relax yourself.When you in the water,you will feel relax.Third,swim can get more friend.You can go to the swimming club,that is a way to meet people with interesting of same.You can try this sport from now on. Also 'internet' in our days helps to get information all over the world, and if you wish to get involved then go to the www.bbc.co.uk.These sites are free way to find most adequate information about actual events both in society and technical life. @CAPS6 settle for anything less for our childrens' education? She always tell me some jokes but some times i laughed !,i love her so much,i don't know how will my world being like without her and i won't to know . Your loved ones they are always there for you when you need them. Now because of our access to computers whether accross the world or just the other end of the block. We will always be in contact with the ones we love. Its  popularity spreads all over world too.There are many reasons behind it to be popular.Everyone is able to enjoy the excitement throughout of this game the session.The people who eager to play football must follow some basic rules which are described below: 1.A football player should be punctual and hard-working. There are many accidentally problems encountered by international students studying in Australia.It is believed that the most important one of the problem is culture barrier.Because of different culture backgrounds,the talking  style of internaional students who come from different countries are various. Instead, she was with her every step on webcam, emailing and @CAPS7. She could even contact her doctors to see her condition after. my father  my father name is Zaheer arat.he is very loving and caring.they gives us all the facilities one should have and dream of these things.he provides all the facilities to us of internet and books so that we can learn better and can be good students and get good marks in the examination.he always encouraged us and said don't afraid of anything because you are braver than anything else.my brothers and me proud of my father.he is very hard working and brave.he has the smiley face.he always tries to laugh other people with their jokes.he always listens to us what we want.he never ever ignore us. With only a @NUM1 chance of living, @PERSON2 gave her the support she needed through most difficult @CAPS2. for example,using wind Energy or Solar Energy for electricity generation we will be used less fuel what is affected in emissions. sukh was so angry with him because he heart her a lot, sukh refuse to give her laptop and her brother start again fighting with her and even he slapped her sister. This process involves five main stages.First,it should take some considerations in design,including background colour,artwork,security issues.Next,skilled machinists is prepared ,in which there are metal plates.Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet).Subsequently, the technical must be used specially for distinction,for example the colour printed on both sides,Special ink is used and imges slightly raised.After this,printed sheets will be inspected carefully.According to the quality of sheets,it will be two results.if the quality is good or the bank notes is partially damaged which can be used,it would cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and disoatched.while those bad sheets will be securely destroyed. public transport has a big role in transportation specially in large cities like Capital city of countries,  using the car some times causes traffic jam if all person uses their own car, to avoid this a good roadways is needed, also the cost of public transportation is lower than private transportation. the movie I´m going to be reviewing is ""the purge""  I actually loved it quite a lot, I just loved all the suspense and the parts they leave you hanging, it´s just way too interesting, the movie is about the american government who annually gives 12 hours where all crime, even murder, is legal, and there are no medical services during that long period of what they call ""the purge"" and anyone can join it, you can kill whoever you want."	2

"Thirdly,Public toilets has been opened for the public to elminate attitude of urinating in the public places.Town council not only encourage people to planting or garndening,it subsidise money for their green improvements.Example,free fertilizers,water pump failitiesand pesticides. You go on at @TIME1pm and all of a sudden it's seven at night. People should spend less time on the computer because they should be outside, it takes away time with your family, and there are other ways to look up information. You should be outside, enjoying the fresh air and playing sports, not stuck inside all day with your eyes glued to a screen. I think that any one wants to start sport can play squach which  gives stretched  and  healthy body,in the same time this sport can be played for a long time of period without caring about the age. Thank you  very much Joe for think in me for to be your witnees, I feel very proud that you think in me for to be your witnees and of course I accept and I will  be in Toronto for your wedding. Above all,the design is the most previous way we should know,which is considered with the background color and artwork.Secondly,we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinsts.And the we need printing and inspection.Eventually,the most essential part comes out,we need significate the quality of the sheets.If it's good,packing and distributin whereas the others shoulde be distroyed as well. Being on the computer on a beautiful is like blocking out the birds' songs on the first day of @DATE1. So, lets start, Most of the Metro cities are now days attract people of city towards Metro only not just because of the fare but because of the time that it saves. I love my small family.My family members are very helpful and supportive.My parents are very support.My parents are my best friends and guides.If any problems faced ,i'm went to my parents and say the problem,there are solve the problem.My family is my world.My parents are the good guides.There are my role model.some times we were go to the tour programs,it's very happy moments.My mammy told the story in night.Mom make the special foods in festivals. I think my town really take care of the environment,because there are a lot of parkｓ in this town and these are very clean.However　some people are not care of environment　that mean some people throw garbage away in the park.I think almost everyone loves parks because a lot of people go to the park and having　lunch,picnic,excersise,nap etc.I think after eat something at the park then clean themselves is good. You lose your whole day to it, and wouldn't you rather be doing something more fun? it's for this reason that I think the public transport is a great benefit for the society, and a good way for move us of the one place at other,  I suggest that  the government  has to give more means for the purpose of improving the public transport. Today, we have more item to recycle as long as we clean properly and put in a proper bin, which will be use it by specialized factory in another item. Computers are going to be around for a long time, and when they die down it will only be because something better came along. Your baby brother won't be a baby forever and your grandparents might not even be there tomorrow. I want to turn to his hobbies, when he isn't working, he is riding on a bike, every evening he takes the bike and rides across some paths for more than forty kilometers by day, so he is very good rider and its quite strong to ride with him. now days young people are influence towards the western culture so,they are getting more fashionable.youngster are interested to wear different stylish and colored clothes.they are happy with wearing different color clothes.they didn't want to wear our cultural dress such as sari,dhoti,choli and many more.they only like to wear shirt,pant skirt,t shirt and many more.youngster are influence by watching different programmes on  television. Espesialy there are a lot of greens these makes good health.However someone have to take care of them.The town have to do that and I think in England there are so many greens all around,so a lot of people take care of these that makes good environment.After I have been to live in England with my family I have goton the feel very much indeed. This town is located in the central zone of the Afghanistan with 4462(km²) space, and has more than seven Million populations, the economic and security situation is not suitable and these factors have directly effect in to the carefulness of environment. my grandma said to my mom. Almost @PERCENT1 of parents feel that same way. So, don't spend all your time alone with a machine, be with your loving family and chairish each moment. I like a car as well,but when I have to driving a car I have to think about parking a lot and I can't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am having travel,so the public transport is making connection with human beings.It is why I think public transport is really important for public and there are a lot of important thing is having a possble in the future. The government can to improve the public transport making a great investmenting like changing the old vehicles for new and increase the number the bus, trains and build more bus station and trains station this kind the action will help a lot the quality of the public transport for population and will become the life of the people more easy. Using books to look up information is better than typing in the word into google because it's important to learn how to use an index and find the book on the shelf. This first reason is all actors shown their talent in this film directly and audience can follow their steps and the story certainly, this essential element which also makes a big success to the film. If you're doing a report on @LOCATION2 for school it would be a lot of fun to go to @LOCATION2 for a few days to learn about it. And you can take pictures with your own camera, not just a picture you found online. It would be a really fun family trip. Even if you're doing your report on a place as boring as @LOCATION1, you could still probably have a lot of fun, hanging out with your family together. This first reason is all actors shown their talent in this film directly and audience can follow their steps and the story certainly, this essential element which also makes a big success to the film. Why would you want to stare at a screen all day when you could be having this much fun?"	2
261	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"People's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years ,Equipment and tools have evolved since the beginning of human history.In recent decades,however, developments have been particularly groundbreaking,Man has been able to invent machines ,which they have been put to work automation is  a great help to mankind,because it significantly increases the standard of living and frees people form hard work.The result is much less work and a better life. as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! More environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of themthere is to that we have a center of care and, other more institutions, we also make environmental protection centers were people can visit and learn about this to sum up our village is very concentrated on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us There are three reasons for this. One day a man and his wife were trying to found a place shallow and without pollution for cultivate, they were poor; they don’t have the necessary sources, but the husband work so hard because his wife had an accident it occurred one day that his wife was working in a campaign of conservation of animal in endangered, she went to a place in search of animals, she heard a sound in a dark place of the jungle so she went to investigated what was that, a creature that have never seen attack she, her partner only heard a shout and they found Lucy the wife of the man in the floor, they ask she if she is ok but he don’t answered so her partner toke it to the doctor, there the doctor said that she was ok but he will never hear again or only if she paid 1 000 dollar for a operation. She always tell me some jokes but some times i laughed !,i love her so much,i don't know how will my world being like without her and i won't to know . Because of this, students get a lot of stress and give up their dreams. Second, you can prevent cheating that alters evaluation. For example, the planetarium in a navigate room for learnt about the position of star, four small boats use for practiced the leadership and navigation in Pontevedra  river, or even the simulation for maked the situations which are seldom happen. Therefore, there may be cheating by a professor or student trying to change grades. But changing grade system can help prevent cheating because your standards are fair. Finally, we can evaluate factors other than the test. Secondly, studying in university, I have to live far from house which make me be homesick, sad, and worried I have to live in dormitory with many strange friends, they ‘re very noisy and I have to share my room with my roommates. Students will be able to think and do more creatively. Education has a crucial part in one society and it’s future and by improving the level of educations system, students can learn more effectively in their entire education life and their career but also their skills will be improved by this process."	2
262	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I had truancy and did not pay attention to studies.That really the biggest harm to a hard-working woman whom my mother tried all her best to feed me up and help me complete my studies.All the members of my family never give me up,and I finished my college studies ,too .I have a good job now.I do really thank my mother and all the members for paying the patient and exertion to me .Now we have  great relationship with each other and treasure the happiness  we get not so easy.So,are the members of my family my best friends？I'll answer you ：there's not much better answer than Yes！ In my case, I want to participate in a lot of events in KAIST to enjoy a campus life. So, if I could change one important thing about KAIST, I would like to make events and festivals more for some reasons. To start with,there are a wide range of troublesome it maybe leadding to this phenomeon.Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the persent day cities are already packed with places of residence,commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce.Additionally, people now continues destroyed more agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their need,which will distory the ecosystem  diversity and biodiversity especially the endangered species. I grew up in a parent family.Sometimes I felt that I was alone and not loved.However,we were lucky enough to have a great mother who tried  all her best to keep my older brother，my older sister and I for completing our college studies .Of course my uncle ,young brother of my mother gave a big hand to go through the hard,so that made us often help each other in my family when the member who was in hard.Especially I was the youngest member in the family ,made much more troubles when I was young . this helps us to make friends and be active more. Second, many events and festivals help us to relieve stress. In KAIST, most students are good at a scientific research and skill.To be skillful in their field, students study hard. For some reasons, I really liked to play basketball, first, playing basketball can train my muscle and make the body more healthier ; the second, my classmates and I all know how to win a game through the basketball game because the basketball game is a teamwork. To prevent this, many events and festivals in university help students to relieve stress about research in many ways, such as sport games, singing contest, etc. Education has a crucial part in one society and it’s future and by improving the level of educations system, students can learn more effectively in their entire education life and their career but also their skills will be improved by this process. SNS, such as instagram, and facebook, is very famous for noticing something in daily life. This is terrible, you do not have privacy authought the society have a blame, because if they do not take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored. And then, there can be chances to notice KAIST for people, and 
In conclusion, if I could change I want to change to make events and festivals more in terms of social ways, such as relieving stress, being active."	2
263	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"I do not believe that such things as book, music, movies, magazines,etc., should be removed from libraries. First, books can be used as monumental learning sources for kids, teenagers, and adults. Just because a book talks about the @CAPS1 and @CAPS9 dying @MONTH1 be a little inappropriate for some age groups but not for teenagers and adults. Also books give a message about how times use to be. First of all,we should thinking out a design and dicide the background colour and artwork,or even security issues.And then for the preparation of metal plates ,the skilled and machinists is considerate.Nect,printing,sheets of bank notes printed (50 bank notes per sheet)colour on both sides,and specWell,the most important step is inspection,we should printed sheets manually inspected. People can travel through the city easily and safely.For instance Melbourn,the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area.Therefore people don't need to drive cars for travelling in the city.The last point is people go for long journey by public transport.Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive. Next, movies now some movies shouldn't be played for certain age groups and I understand that, but movies like @CAPS2 and To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4 @CAPS5 are teaching us our @ORGANIZATION1 and how far we've come from being segregated and the disrespect of each others race. Also movies gives a more visual way of what things were like so we can kind of get a interactive way on how things look like and how you can relate the book to the movie. pain and gain  This movie is bases quote on quote on a ""true story"" buts obviously director michael bay know for the transformers franchise puts a lot of hollywood into this movie, its about a bodybuilder named daniel lugo who decides to kidnap a rich guy and make him sign away all of his properties, which obviously its not a great plan that backfires on him, and eventualy police get him. So movies are definetly a stay on my list. In addition, a big factor of @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION1 is music. I could see how some music could be bad but also some artist talk  about how it really is tough where they come from and how music is a get away for them. Also, just for young children that are in process of growth and development, physical exercise is essential to do it, because they can have a healthier life.Young children try to effort, and wants to win at this age, and if they train results were better and encourages to keep training.In psychic way, if you are adapated forms relations and create new friends. We learn how music was in the @DATE1 and compare it to music now. On one hand you put all your things in the car and drive anywhere you want to, on the other hand if you feel not very well to drive, you have no money to buy a car or the downtown of your city is closed for all the means of transport except for the public ones: tram, bus or trolley bus is your wayout. Nowadays a person's worth seems to be judge  according to the social status and material possessions, that is mostly to happen in high class famiies, as they are foccus on achievements as power, political influences etc. One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance,  homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society. Now take that speech put it in a song form and I guarantee that more @CAPS9 capture the message and take it into there grasp on how they could help the cause. Them they drink a cafe that give them many energy to construct faster the building, this café has a combination for the people can to live all the night. Say your favorite artist is @CAPS7 @PERSON1, now wouldn't you rather listen to @CAPS7 @PERSON1 make a statement about life or a political view rather than a song like that by @ORGANIZATION2. So music is most definetly staying on the list because it has the power to move @CAPS9, make you feel different ways, and look at things you've never seen in away before. Last, magazines, some Magazines are just inappropriate. What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player ,i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families, Hey my name is Joe and i´m 21 years old and i´l think i´l would compliment the summer camp very good, because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak. you are responsible for your workers and the customer satisfaccion, However is very satisfying to see how your own company is grow up and your customers return again because they loved your job. And the strengths and weaknesses in both of segmental and suprasegmental, I think it’s maybe the learning habit, when I heard a sentences, I would use many varieties of tone and manner to say the sentences again, therefore,I can easily be interpreted illustrations instructions the emotions and feelings."	2

Online Lerning Positiv things about the online lernign are dat you are more mobile with your smartphone and you dont have to carry so much paper with you, also your on your own and in your own lerning speed what makes it more spesific on the user it selfs. I remember my kindergarden computer class where we'd reserch dinnosaurs and weather patterns on kid friendly websites. And now being in middle school we use websites like @CAPS1 Online for up to date reliable information. Moreover, I've seen my mom, a nurse and hospital manager, use the internet for videos and articles on how to do certian procederes and ways to orginnaize a productive hospital. So, lets start, Most of the Metro cities are now days attract people of city towards Metro only not just because of the fare but because of the time that it saves. Furthermore, computers are used as a way for people to stay in touch. @PERCENT2 of teenagers say they talk to other peers using @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 or @CAPS5. Its a great way for us to communicate with our busy schedules when we can't always get together. Also with parents losing jobs in this ecconomic downfall, kids are always moving. According to the information donne, the most used is the car thus most of the families has one, but the public transportation is getting more and more common for those ones who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectfully with the planet. I though we'd never talk again and I was so upset to say goodbye, but because of @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 we talk non-stop and have accually never been closer. We the management of The Arch London Hotel received your mail and wishes to let you know that you should make known to us the position you desired to work in via return mail along with a scan copy of your signed contract of agreement to enable us make every necessary corrections.Thank you.

Secondly,Closed trash bins provided to the people in order to collect the waste and recycling.People come forward and utilising this bin effectively instead of throwing away.As a result of this town looks clean compare to previous decades. Some @MONTH1 contest ""@CAPS3, use a phone or go out."" @CAPS1 if they're away on a trip, or live thousands of miles away? As i didn’t found nothing, i went to the place he live at and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he care about so as i continued to go to his houes i notice he will alays go to tehe same house so i decidec to follow him to the house and i foun out he was dating a girl she might be his girlfrien so i finally gota an idea, i would drive him crazy just as he did with me, that way she will think he had problems on his mind and left him, but son i thougt about it again and realized that if i did that she will try to help him and they will be more united,  so i decided to drive them both crazy almost at the border of death,  jus as he did with me! Computers allow us to reserch topics @CAPS5 need for classes or work. ""@CAPS5 can get alot of detailed information from thousands of sites. Sceptics might ask the question ""@CAPS6 not go to a library."" Some of us might prefer to stay at home. Another reason is, that it maybe snowy, or the library is closed. More environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of themthere is to that we have a center of care and, other more institutions, we also make environmental protection centers were people can visit and learn about this to sum up our village is very concentrated on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us Computers also fulfill a great need to entertain ourselfs. Games sites like ""facebook"" have become very popular. They can provide us with emotional release from the everyday world. A pontential argument might you ""@CAPS6 go outside?"" In the present world television is very important.But sometimes it can also affect us in a negetive way..most people around the world can see any news in live.media is more help full for the people .television is also using as a study  material for example smart classes, online courses etc. Above all,the design is the most previous way we should know,which is considered with the background color and artwork.Secondly,we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinsts.And the we need printing and inspection.Eventually,the most essential part comes out,we need significate the quality of the sheets.If it's good,packing and distributin whereas the others shoulde be distroyed as well. My favourite sport is playing tennis.I play it three times a week (on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays) in the club of tui.I had been playing tennis from 2 years ago with two of my best friends.I enjoy playing tennis because it is a sport that requires skills, concentration and speed.I am not very good at all but I like to play it with my friends and do matches on Saturdays ."	2.5

"Dear editor, Computers are one of the best things that have ever happened to the human race. They benefit society in every way imaginable, and have numerous positive affects on people. Computers improve hand eye coordination, allow people to learn about many subjects that books do not give them acess to, and allow millions of people every day to talk and communicate with friends and family. The most important use for computers is learning. one of the most amazing parts of the film is when Teresa calls Cruel for go for them and take them again to the Cruel building and like all of them doesn't wanna go with them they start a war and they take Mihno with them and at the end Thomas decide to go after them and he give a super great speech for all the persons go with them and help him to get back Mihno, and what i really want to see in the next film is that if Thomas is mad at Teresa( i never like her) and if they get free and the world comes back to the normal world. The other chart is about employer support, under 26 years old is the most higterst because it almost have 70%, the scentd higterst is age 26-29 years old; it has 50% of people are taken; niy yhe most lower is 35% age of group are 30-39 years old. Without computers, I would not be able to do this. Also, on days when it snows during the night, I always check the school's website when I wake up in order to ensure that school is still on. This is a helpful resource and I don't know what I'd do without it. Another thing computers allow us to do is check the news. With the click of your mouse, you can check to see who won the presidency, or what shows are on tonight. I am person that like going to do exercise, for this reason I like practise some sports, but the truth is that my favorite sport all around the world is the soccer.I believe that play soccer is an excellent activity, because in every game that the people can like always has to exist some rules. This not only benifits my mom who checks her email five times every minute, but my little three year old sister who loves to move the mouse around, and type in random letters on documents. It could entertain her for days, but most importantly, it helps improve her eye-hand coordination every second she sits in that chair. Three robots in specific hour make a show with instruments like a band.Foxy the pirate makes a show individually in her pirate cove, The children loves Foxy because plays with the kids making questions about the pirates and count a pirate story. Does why, is easy to believe that if things continue with this rhythm and transforming everything, in a closer future of 50 years everything is gonna be completely knew and different. If classmates forgot to write down homework they can email the teacher instantly, and know exactly what the homework is and even open the sheet that the teacher attached, and print it out. when I find me in London, I'm going to the buckingham palace located in the city of westminster and I'll see your art gallery and tourist attraction of the British monarchy continue in London, I will visit to the largest parks in London, the hyde park that having a full day of guided outdoor games and activities for perservation thereof park follow in London I'll go for a walk to arrive at the big ben that is the most beautiful bullding in all its splendour when I will take pictures later, I'll take the underground of London that is a public fast transit system, I'm trawiling in it when I'll leave of the underground in the station wembley park I going to the wembley stadium where I will enjoy an evening of football, the match started at 8:00pm On the one hand, there are alot of famous player on volleyball who had Knee ligament injuries ,The most frequent mechanism of injury was landing from a jump in the attack zone.In addition to this,Injuries were more frequent during games than training. For another,there are many different types of programs,which can broaden our eyes,they give details of education,plus other meaningful information，such as documentaries，talk show and so on.These programs are not just for killing the time,but for educating. This was very special to me and could not have been done without computers. we can see that there are lots of serious and frequently weather disaster happened in decades, such as typhoon, hurricane, wild fire and mud slide. When he was just about cursing the final line he got hurt and his mussels was dying and star to peel off a black matter, at that point the guys in suit thought that he won’t be able to cross the line , but when they saw that he kept running, they freeze the time and run after him, he stopped for a moment but then , he start running again and when he cross the line he woke up in a red somber fluid, he was wiped out from the matrix, he opened his eyes and saw a flying robot, suddenly he was on a wood wheelchair and they said that he would never be able to walk again , besides that, he stands up and tried to walk again."	2.5

Then peter stared "" happy birthday my lovely sister"" peter said and gave here key of a car Sara was so amazed and hug here brother and grateful him . In addition, they lead to less interaction with “real” people. Finally, they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. Transportation is very important in cities,villages as well as in sub-lines.Many people has no vehicles,they only depends on public transport due to some reasons.Any way in some cases,car is very useful to reach the destination very fast. For starters, computers are harmful because they are very bad for our eyes. Between the @DATE1 @DATE2 and @DATE3, doctors saw nearly a @PERCENT1 increase in eye problems that resulted in either surgery, glasses, or contacts. This can be directly associated with the overuse of personal computers. i love my family special my little sister, she has sixteen years old, i consider my best friend because i used to tell her everything of my life. My favorite sport is swimming.I engaged in swimming in nine years old.I had gotten first prize in a match.As a result,I think that I have some intellent on swimming.Since then,I meet my teacher in the pool.She teach me a lot of things,and be the most important figure in my life.She is a doctor,she told me that swimming will let my body more better.From then on,I fell my disease in decreasind and fell relax.Consequently,I need to swim usually. It can be seen, how work gets done faster, however the cost of medical treatments actually surpasses the little extra profit gained by modernizing. Secondly, computers are harmful because they lead to less time being with “real” people. At first and important change is about eating prepared food that isn't healthy usually,its reason probably woman's life stile that is going to big change in the way that they don't like staying at home and spend their time to making food ,now they prefer to buy prepared good. Also, a study by the @ORGANIZATION1 has shown that there are roughly @PERCENT2 fewer conversations at social gatherings than just @DATE1. We can change  everything hurt us if we need if we have volition The reasons for  stress are more diverse perhaps because  we have an  exam period,  family proplems or because we think in negative way,  or we destroyed  ourselves  in long hours of working and canceld our needs  for enough comfortable,  and  lots of reasons to stress...   We must get  out of  the stress quickly before  lose ourself because it's very hurtful period, for example you can read a  book,  doing sport,  play music,  eating delicious food, remmeber  all the positive thing was took place with you,  talk about someone who trust for him,  take off every thing make you upset and make you life tiring,  go out and eat meal with your best joking friends,  and  there a lot of you have to do...   Remmeber the stress is not  lasting thing,  and you can avoid  it  But if you  are willing  to live in happy life. Finally @PERSON1, social relations professional, stated that people end up with a lack of understanding when they can’t feel the emotion a person has when he/she is speaking. Sure, you can video chat, but that still does not convey the real feeling behind a person’s words. Finally, computers are harmful because they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. In the end, large colleges admit largest number of students, so the student may do establishing friendships more from different nationalities, also it serves the community by graduating many students in various majors. Also, average people get @PERCENT3 fewer workouts, according to @CAPS4’s @CAPS5, which was not likely directly influenced by overuse of computers. Finally the obesity rate has risen from next to nothing to over @NUM2 in the past ten @DATE1. Research showed that the majority of the obese patients spent excessive time on their little boxes of ten. While you might feel that this is not completely due to computers, it has been proven time and time again that these machines are the main reason behind the world’s currently unhealthy lifestyle. Personal computers have a very negative effect toward the society of today. i like volei because it was part of my life and of life of my mother, is my favorite sport, but i like over sports too, same i don't play volei because I'm bad, and my friends that know, don't like of  peoples bad of volei.I'm watching they playing, they're really very good, but when play over school, they're very bad when he come she start crying and thought he would break up with her and she did not give him a chance to talk or explain anything she started to cry louder and accused him of cheating that make michael astonished how she did not trust in him ,how she thought that about him and he told her that he can not stand that anymore he would break up with her and he left .Michael close the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake Finally, they end up forcing people into an unhealthy lifestyle. It is large, clean and  comforktable and has air conditioning and internet wifi  it introduces many kinds of delicious foods like meat, cheeken ,sea foods and if you want anything different you will find it  there .it is suitable for my class because it is difference from any other restaurant"	2.5
268	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Students Should Be Specialized in One Subject
  In January, college students start to make their next semester schedule. It is always difficult to decide what classes to take for next semester. Some people say that students should learn various subjects during their college life; however, in my perspective, students should concentrate on one subject because specialized students are better for getting a job and being a fast learner. Specialized students are easy to get a job than generalized students. In job market, needs of employers are clear, which is hiring people who can help their work right after they hire. one day he got fight with her sister, even he made her cry.both of them stop talking to each other and after some day the boy need laptop of her sister sukh. In my personal experience, I start to work as designer because I learned deeply about design process with several classes about design. In addition to job opportunity, learning one subject deeply increase the speed of learning. Michael is a good boy and he always listen to his mother .on time Michael was very angry as he got a bad score in his test .when he was home his mother was cooking she asked him what is the wrong ? in modern day there is very little public transpotr are used,ganeral public prefer much faster and conveninece  ways of traveling  around.though the pulic transport are used in mager citys to avoied traffic conjustion,it is wlidly reconizge that public transport are eco friendly. Some public transports  as trains do not contaminate as cars or motorbikes.Many people said that public transport is not confortable, thats true, from my point of view bus is not so unconfortable. It is true; however, students do not have to widen their perspective in college. I like a car as well,but when I have to driving a car I have to think about parking a lot and I can't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am having travel,so the public transport is making connection with human beings.It is why I think public transport is really important for public and there are a lot of important thing is having a possble in the future. Communicating with them can widen their perspective enough, besides if they want, they can study some basics of other subjects whatever they want. Thus, students do not have to learn various subjects on college. People complaint about how the information about different TV shows don't contribute in the process of learning, that's why many of This programmes are considered trash, because of the multiples shows such as realities, talk shows,or showbiz that hardly ever have a good message or something interesting for people. It has benefits on getting a job faster, and it is easier and faster to learn when they study based on their accumulated knowledge in one subject. However the best option is that you came here and after I present my friends and their fathers because they can help with your job. Thus, in my perspective, students should be specialist, not a generalist."	2.5
269	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"This perspective of life is inspired by contracultural movements and some people call to these people as “alternative”, but it is each day more common and it let a inclusive and diverse society. Dear Jo, As you know, my grandmother actually lives in France with my cousint Jonh, unfortunately he has to make three months course outside of the country, Jonh will leave France next weekend, but instead it is not possible, I have to go and look after her because none of my family cant waist three months over there. But if I could change one thing in KAIST, I would change the lecture in English. Firstly, the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel.Secondly, the public vehicle route are more far than usual route.Thirdly,it is also crowded and no privacy.Finally,there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker. First, students have a hard time having English lectures. For example, my friends who did not have studied English a lot, have a hard time understanding lectures in English. That makes student's academic performance to get decreased because they can't understand what the professor is explaining. If students do not understand the lecture, they have to study that part again and again, which is inefficient. Actually, we have a lot of problem with traffic: lots of cars in the railway and it don't running; the number of cars in the street cause a dirty pollution;  crawded railways causes a later destination. When I was taking the course, Signals and System, the professor said he has a hard time having lectures in English. He said he will use his mother language sometimes. As every year the twenty three of April, day of book, in my school all the student of fifth and sixth of primary do short story competition and the winner have a gift. The English lectures have been used since 2004. At that time, four students and one professor have committed suicide because of the English lecture. But, the public transportation have a lot of future bacase a lot of reassons, first the time, if the place you want to reach finally is really far the different type of vehicles of public transportation will get you there faster than your car, also the complications about the field, like if you want to go from America to Europe there is no highway that cross the ocean you need an airplane and unless you have one, you will cannot reach travel between continents with your car, a different reasson is politics, because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska you will not need to pass through Canada, the commodity is a really important reasson because drive for 8 hours is exhausting and it will be unsafe also, the economics is a factor to, because the attrition of your car it will be more that in the normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do, it will be expensive that in public transportation. on the other hand, public transportation takes more time to get to the required station, because already public transport taking long path to go across more places and as more as peoples take benefits from it, and public transport usually crowed and do not be on time. This perspective of life is inspired by contracultural movements and some people call to these people as “alternative”, but it is each day more common and it let a inclusive and diverse society. The government can to improve the public transport making a great investmenting like changing the old vehicles for new and increase the number the bus, trains and build more bus station and trains station this kind the action will help a lot the quality of the public transport for population and will become the life of the people more easy."	2.5
270	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"What do I think about library censorship? I believe that there should be some censorship, but not too much censorship. i dont think the public transport does not have future, there are a lot of people who can not buy a car and has to use the communite transport. Certain materials are too strong to be put in libraries. As well, we have to promote that the people get jobs close their accommodation or get the accommodation close to the jobs, because we have too much pollution and we could reward the companies that hire staff close to the place of job, maybe in a circle of 4 kilometres, as well we could reward the people that turn their accommodation for live near to the job or for going  there by a bicycle. so it become a fashion of using personal vehicle which create a lot of problem big one traffic problem..... now traffic problem is the biggest problem. Now there are some materials that are pushing the line of their content. They are strong, but not too strong to not be put in libraries. Some people enjoy these strong materials and should be able to find them in their libraries for their pleasure. Just because someone doesn't enjoy this material that the library has provided, doesn't mean that the material should be taken away. If that was how things worked there would be nothing in the library for people to enjoy. Every person has their own taste in materials, be it more mature materials or a little more 'tame' materials. sukh was so angry with him because he heart her a lot, sukh refuse to give her laptop and her brother start again fighting with her and even he slapped her sister. Firstly, Django Unchained remembered us the hard life suffered by black people in the past, due to a great introduction without dialogues, where black people were unchained while they came back to be selling to an owner farm, it being matching with an amanzing soundtrack as identity Tarantino´s films. Finally, Taiwan still suffers economic slump, but we have so many businesses likes to innovate, market their product, customers likes to buy it. Fdi can play important role in it.It give competition to national companies .By virtue of which they  work properly mannerly and give better option to policy holders.people can always buy nominal premium we should aware them about the types of insurance as well as benefits of the insurancce. Sometimes I @MONTH1 be disapointed when I'm looking for something in a library and it's not there, because to some people it's too strong but to me and others it's just a good source of harmless entertainment. In conclusion I think that there should be some censorship in libraries, but not too much censorship that people can't find things that interest them. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and has their own form of entertainment, but their libraries shouldn't be built on an indivdual's opinions."	2.5
271	Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"The discussion of whether computers have made life easier or more complex and stressful has always been an argumentative one for the modern times. although traveling by car is really interesting but still using public transport has its advantages ,by using public transport you're saving  effort when  driving a car for along distance you will get tired , some people don't have enough money to buy their own car . To begin with, it would be natural to observe that computers have enabled people to do many things when compared to the past. The evidence suggests that the growth of possibilities is exponential. MOTASSEM is nice and lovely fiance he love his job as he is Patient will dong has jop .he is  a  hard worker he has amazing laughs     .When you started  talk with him you will be inspire by his knowledge and his way of talk he have the talent to Convinces  thought. basketball needs that the person should be tall enough to play it .i like basketball because it makes me happy,fit,have self_confidence and makes me active .if anyone want to play basketball ,he should do many exercises and try to be able to play it because everything is difficult at first but we shouldn't give up . Reduce the fast food that make people obese and not healthy.It will be better if you gave drinks compared to the weather like whenever its winter we would like a hot drink and if it is summer we would like a chilled drink. When those huge benefits are analyzed, it can be seen that the freedom of contemporary people had been increased remarkably when compared to past. We can really confirm that there is no future for public transport, if so, we will have to drive a car instead of buying a ticket for public transport and go to office, city, home and so on using private transport, however we can also think that in the centre has no parking car or it is not enough for the whole private car, thereby, if we use a public transport, we can simplify our lives and spend less simply because we are able to save money and time. Another important aspect that computers have a great role is that contemporary people live longer and healthier. She told me not good at all, but my was good and she also added that you may got the chance and finally I got it.After three days later our result has been published and I got the chance but the girl didn't. at last I wanna talk about my cousins , I love the most of them especially the cousin in the same age , they are my friends , i love too much ,and also the rest of my family To analyze the contributions of computerization to the health industry; examples of computer modellings of human body, more accurate treatment devices and robotic supports in operations, can be given. Therefore, the role of computers in health industry is inevitably important. I suggested to other people  first to understand yourself such as  what do you like, which is possible and than practice after every success My name is shousheng and live in Montreal Canada.Alrough Canada is an English country however in Montreal, the offical language is Freach. When this is the case, the level of the jobs that humans are expected to do have been increased dramatically because the evolution of computer industry is extremely rapid. When I was young , I enjoyed playing basketball.I thought that it's the best sport ever.It made me fit and strong.It taught me the meanings of teamwork and leadership.I Kept playing basketball 4 years continuously till I joined the secondary school.My advice to anyone starting basketball is to never giving up and always keep playing till the last minute. However, people should not think in a self-oriented way in that situation. Since the evolution of ideas and life had always been the reality, the same complexity and stressfulness will not be a big burden for the next generation as they will easily adapt to this situation. Transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible Thus, those issues can be seen as non-permanent and fixable issues. To conclude, it would be possible to indicate the fact that computers are very beneficial for humanity in terms of making life easier and more convenient when compared to the past. Even though there might be some issues regarding the computerization, it would be possible to show that humanity will adapt the computerized society soon in case they intend to obtain the proper education. People can travel through the city easily and safely.For instance Melbourn,the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area.Therefore people don't need to drive cars for travelling in the city.The last point is people go for long journey by public transport.Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive."	2.5

Michael is a good boy and he always listen to his mother .on time Michael was very angry as he got a bad score in his test .when he was home his mother was cooking she asked him what is the wrong ? Some say that computers make life more complex and stressful; but in my opinion, computers make life much easier and convenient. These days, computers are advanced enough that it could assist human in a wide range of tasks. Firstly,the growing number of private cars cause the big problem with traffic jam .People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam.That wastes people's time and make people feel exhausted.Not mention to say,it's definitely hard to enjoy travelling in holidays.Secondly,private  cars are the main reason for the air pollution.We should consider the protection of environment for human future,not only care about the convenience we can see for now. George's restaurant is a very pleasant place with many tasteful recipes from all around the world to enjoy alone or with your company your dinner.The Head-chef is an experienced and skillful man in his work.The food ,his team of chefs,prepare is always magnificent and the decoration a piece of art ,not to mention that the decoration is fully engaged in the Head-chef .Not only the food but also the restaurant itself is a very beautiful destination . Moreover, developers has created many applications to make use of a computer to the limit, such as document-editing applications, digital clock, calculator, and calendar. All these applications can make life easier by turning everything to digital. Users no longer need to buy or find an access to tools to make their life easier as computer can act as a multi-purpose tool. Firstly,the growing number of private cars cause the big problem with traffic jam .People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam.That wastes people's time and make people feel exhausted.Not mention to say,it's definitely hard to enjoy travelling in holidays.Secondly,private  cars are the main reason for the air pollution.We should consider the protection of environment for human future,not only care about the convenience we can see for now. Furthermore, with the internet, everything can be done online: shopping, watching movies, file storage, etc. Although users may not have the exact same experience of actually doing these tasks, it is less time-consuming and more convenient to do them online. no of all people could afford to make conveyenc by car .car is easy and cozy also but public transprt is fair is much affordable to all clasess of poeple public transport means mainly pubic bus.people used to travell long disistance by publis bus .it is possible to carry large number of people of different places to carry in bus. For example, jobs like programmers that mainly use computer can be really stressful, but it is due to the task that they are doing using the computers. It is agreeable that the computers are complicated, but so as any other tools, it takes time to get used to and fully gain advantages out of it. Then the engineers call to other sector to ensure the doubt of Atlantis then the professional say that other was correct. In addition, computers can help relieve stress. many countries are truly started to concern no environment and worried about the globe warming ,In schools teachers are doing their best  to educate children how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy,also they train them how to plant trees in public gardens of their towns ,Although  government strict so many laws and taxes in the people how do not pay their taxes to the council for cleaning of the rubbish from towns and villages,in the biggest polluted city in the world people started to use bicycles and cycling instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city,also they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive. I am also committed to preparing monthly reports for newspaper supplement “The Voice of Women” which issued by the WATC “Women's Affairs Technical Committee , and I have the cooperation with the Environment and Development the magazine which issued by Center for development work ""Maan"", annd other web sites and news and media organizations. Recently when I was in youtube I saw a movie trailer, the film appeared so good and days later my friends told me if I wanted to go them to the cinema, so I decided to go and luckily they had decided to see the film that days before I had seen."	2.5

"However, I think the tools should be improved, such as killer’s knife and actors'costumes, the knife looks like as brittle as a handicraft, I believe those are seconded-handed clothing. I believe the effects of computers on people are positive ones. For one, computers let people talk and socialize, even if they are on different sides of the planet. Another effect they have is letting people work faster in businesses and other jobs that require mathmatics. Lastly, computers allow people to see far away places and learn about almost anything with a click of a button. Because of the internet, people across the globe can talk to each other as if they were neighbors. Lets say a friend or family had to move to another country or state. They could be apart for months or even years. I screamed, my anger had dominated my mind i didnt had no longer control over my actions, i was afarid of what i had become and what i could do, but i could not control my self and the only thing i could think of was him suffering with a slow death and the satisaction i would feel when i finally had my revange, the best revange. I do currently master but I can devote myself to the Fellowship Especially since I finished the Pre-Masters and now I need only follow-up from time to time with my guide Academic, so I have the time for the Fellowship . Computers also have some more ""practical"" uses. the movie I´m going to be reviewing is ""the purge""  I actually loved it quite a lot, I just loved all the suspense and the parts they leave you hanging, it´s just way too interesting, the movie is about the american government who annually gives 12 hours where all crime, even murder, is legal, and there are no medical services during that long period of what they call ""the purge"" and anyone can join it, you can kill whoever you want. Last month,my friend came to Korea and visited me.In the morning We went to Ocean Park ,we saw dolphin,cat, horse and many animals .In the afternoon we went to play rollar coatser,I screamed on top of voice and called for help .Actually I hate playing rollar coster .We played mind train ,punch and a lot of games .At the end of the day I was just like running out of gas ,because I was too tired to walk any further. Dear USA Summer camp I reply to your advertisement for work with children this summer in summer camps, have looked after children aged 5-10 and it was a fantastic experience, worked at school in north Africa like a volunteer and learnt a lot about children,  think that i'm a suitable person for the job because use to be an energetic and cheerful person and very hardworking, love working with children and  like organising several types of activities, I'm not very good cooking but i can learn very fast. But with a computer, you wouldn't need to do any of that. first my favorite sport is futboll and i like for many reasons for example while you are watching a match you´re going to feel exited and entretaining besides that fubol has the best fotboll player than ever who is leo mesy he's the best and he s able to awesome stuff when he´s playing. There are also educational purposes for computers. The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots. You could take a trip through the safari or go on an adventure in the raln forest. You could take in the beauty of the great plains or watch the ever changing sands of the sahara desert. You could learn about the greeks, archemedes, ancien egypt, or pacman, with a computer, the world is your oyster. Reduce the fast food that make people obese and not healthy.It will be better if you gave drinks compared to the weather like whenever its winter we would like a hot drink and if it is summer we would like a chilled drink. If the public transport will be by higher quality, faster and fewer rates, majority of citizens will be prefer: is more calm to relax and read a newpaper or a magazine during the way in a collective transport than an indiivdual one; moreover, the time spend up to go and came back will be reduced, because it promotes less car in the railway. So think, are computers really harmful?"	2.5
274	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"You've got mail! @CAPS1 my computer which is filled with emails from distant relatives and friends. In this view, I consider, though, there is lots of sports on Televison, they are not too much, because the people have looke for it. we all know that do sport is very important to keep our life healthy and happy.My favourite sport actually is walking;and I prefer walking in the morning and before sundown.I like also walking in public street,gardens,clubs and on the shore.when i want to go anywhere;I do my best to go on foot.I like this sport since my childhood because I found that I can think about my good time when I was child and relax with myself to think carefully about my present and future.The walking can also fitness and do the knee stronger.It would be interesting to accompain your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time.I advice my guys who suffer from laziness and overweight,try to walk one hour at least and after that they will like this sport. Because of this incredible invention, computers have allowed us to do @LOCATION1 things that are truly astonishing. To begin, we have thrown away typr writers and purchased computers. Also in the sort way, we should go walking to the destination.icle If we are working with  sameone in the same jobs, and  who lives near or he is our neighbour, we can go to the work in the same car, this way we use less oil. First of all, with the extreene amounts of typing needed for colleges, most occupations, and everyday list, computers have made this faster and easier process. at last I wanna talk about my cousins , I love the most of them especially the cousin in the same age , they are my friends , i love too much ,and also the rest of my family Secondly we have gained amazing hand-eye cordination skills. Furthermore, be typing and reading at the same time, we have trained or eyes to do many @LOCATION1 things similar to playing the piano. Lastly, now with spell check, we are able to edit papers without using someone elses help! All this will help people to live easily, but only to have more time to work, because the type of mind that reign that time will focus in the companies and make money and spend it, this is the reason why a lot of jobs are changing to a home office and the firms are giving more and more facilities to their employees to be more efficient. Another reason is because of communication. Thanks to many @LOCATION1 communication applications such as @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can now communicate with a surplus of distant friends and relatives. For example, with both my sisters at college it was hard for me to communicate with them however, due to @CAPS2, I can see their pictures, instant message them, and even video chat! Without computers, being able to see their pictures and what they are up to would have never been possible. Secondly, email has created a fast, easy way to update people on schedule changes, ideas and even sales and specials offered by stores! Snail mail is no more with this extreemly efficient way of communication! This process involves five main stages.First,it should take some considerations in design,including background colour,artwork,security issues.Next,skilled machinists is prepared ,in which there are metal plates.Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet).Subsequently, the technical must be used specially for distinction,for example the colour printed on both sides,Special ink is used and imges slightly raised.After this,printed sheets will be inspected carefully.According to the quality of sheets,it will be two results.if the quality is good or the bank notes is partially damaged which can be used,it would cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and disoatched.while those bad sheets will be securely destroyed. Last but not least, computers have allowed us to access information like never before. This first reason is all actors shown their talent in this film directly and audience can follow their steps and the story certainly, this essential element which also makes a big success to the film. Not to mention, the process is exceedingly @CAPS5 type in exactly what you are looking for and you will be brought to exactly what you need! Thirdly, there is many more options and sites to choose from. For example, if you were to type in a certain animal there would be an overdose of pages pertaining to your topic. Now, it is possible to find exactly what you are looking for! There is no question that computers have made searching for information easier and faster, which is exactly why we need them in our everyday lives. I will tell you a review of a thriller, the thriller is Hunger games it is about some capitals and people are choised and play on a game, you have to kill persons for they don't kill you, is a movie that have suspense because you want to know ho survey, in the movie someone love someone and protect each others, is very cute but on the 3 movies they are bad moments with the family, capitals, Friends, etc. Without computers we would not be able to type documents as quickly, communicate, and find information in a fashion. Firstly, Django Unchained remembered us the hard life suffered by black people in the past, due to a great introduction without dialogues, where black people were unchained while they came back to be selling to an owner farm, it being matching with an amanzing soundtrack as identity Tarantino´s films. According to the information donne, the most used is the car thus most of the families has one, but the public transportation is getting more and more common for those ones who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectfully with the planet. most of girl doesnt like this,i think that it takes us energy,we need to do exercise,reasonable diet...and so on."	2.5
275	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"Having a part time job as a college student is important because it serves as a training for us even though we need to balance our study and work. I think that being a college student, if we want to buy something we really want, we should earn money by ourselves, not using the money of our parents. Using our own money, we will not feel guilty anymore. Having a part time job, we will have the working experience and have the chance to adapt the different relationship between classmates and colleagues earlier than the people who do not have the part time job. Having the working experience can help us as a college students to find the ideal job more easily in the future. i know that i am not professional player and i am n't belong to any team  but i like this game .basketball is so simple play but it is need Speed ,concentration and The ability to determine the distances  , it  contains of two team of five player and each team try to get a high point by throwing the ball through the basket. We as a college students, we can also expand our interpersonal relationship by having a part time job. Some people say that basket it's only for tall guys but it isn't true, in the A league in Italy we have different players not very tall like 1 meter and 60 , so if you love this game you can play it no matter what find only a ball and a hoop and play it. Secondly, the Hall doesn't matter with the environment; for example, the Hall stopped with garbage's selection collection when the new major assumeded the hall. Playing the cricket will also gives physical exercise to our body.we can bowl,batt,field in the cricket which  requires lot of  physical activities. But, on the other hand, because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable; cars are so many; very noisy, unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth. Dear Sir or Madam Reference to your advertisement I would like to apply for the position to work in AMERICAN SUMMER CAMPS,I am John from  the capital city of south state in India, I worked in middle aged  school for about 2 years, where I had experience which will be suitable for the current position."	2.5
276	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1,     @CAPS1 I was growing up in my small little neighborhood, life could not have been more simple. For children, life is eating, sleeping, playing, and laughing. The diabetes is the increasing  of the glucosa in the blood, The have two types, first the Diabetes Type 1 that is predent in childrens, pacient needs insuline every day, also this diabetes is caused by the destruction of the insuline realized by the person´s immuny siste. By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we don't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars don't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport. for carreer has 80% under 26 years old students are taken it, for the age over 49 years old only has 20%people are taken; but if you counper interest, it is totoly different; for under 26 years old have only 10%; but for over 49 years old it has 70%. By viewing adult-oriented material, such as books at a library, children can gain premature knowledge that can be harmful to their development. However, libraries should not fear stocking their shelves with books that are appropriate for adults because an author spend countless hours writing that book,  that book represents a portion of history for the human race, and not everyone @MONTH1 find the contents inappropriate. This attitude reduced enromous amount of smoke pollution from the pipes.Government policy changes help a lot for water preservation.Many factories follwing the regulations and not draining the harmful wastage in the water. A censored author must feel like a basketball player that did not make the cut despite hours of practice. when i ran with the ball, i feel that i hold a goal or a valuable something and i should offer my best to put it in his place and make it in right way  . Not agreeing with someone's interest in a subject is no reason to exclude his valuable thoughts from society. Books that are appropriate for adults deserve to be displayed for adults as the author intended. Every piece of literature that has ever been written documents a portion of history of the human race. We can change  everything hurt us if we need if we have volition The reasons for  stress are more diverse perhaps because  we have an  exam period,  family proplems or because we think in negative way,  or we destroyed  ourselves  in long hours of working and canceld our needs  for enough comfortable,  and  lots of reasons to stress...   We must get  out of  the stress quickly before  lose ourself because it's very hurtful period, for example you can read a  book,  doing sport,  play music,  eating delicious food, remmeber  all the positive thing was took place with you,  talk about someone who trust for him,  take off every thing make you upset and make you life tiring,  go out and eat meal with your best joking friends,  and  there a lot of you have to do...   Remmeber the stress is not  lasting thing,  and you can avoid  it  But if you  are willing  to live in happy life. Therefore, no book should be censored, no matter how inappropriate the material is. Firstly,hyrid cars only allowed to use during weekends as result of this most people not using there cars all the week. One they animals went with Ana and give her an incentive for being an athlete or make something else than stay sleeping. By remembering these mistakes, mankind will be able to move forward in literature. @CAPS1 books are not 'mistakes', they serve as reminders of the high-points in literature. All literature, appropriate and inappropriate, is a piece of mankind's history that should not be kept a secret. Finally, who is to judge what is a 'mistake' in literature? basketball needs that the person should be tall enough to play it .i like basketball because it makes me happy,fit,have self_confidence and makes me active .if anyone want to play basketball ,he should do many exercises and try to be able to play it because everything is difficult at first but we shouldn't give up . Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Furthermore, for any given book there is at least one person who disagrees with its message. A library is built for the education of the public, not for the interests of one person. So they make a plan to display all... The next day when they were about to start filming they ere non ants there so they search for them, but they can't find them... In that moment the ants and Penny attack them in their backs, making them to leave the place. The decision on the appropriateness of a novel is up to the reader, not the government or library or activist group. Also, just for young children that are in process of growth and development, physical exercise is essential to do it, because they can have a healthier life.Young children try to effort, and wants to win at this age, and if they train results were better and encourages to keep training.In psychic way, if you are adapated forms relations and create new friends. We were all excited, those from Lala Band minunate.Their voices have positive vibration through their musical and give you a good feeling.On the scene moves very well and know how to take pleasure to the public.I am feeling wonderful and my promise is that when going to have a special occasion to go to a concert supported by Lala Band, you will be with me.As like this in all my heart.I hope as those recounted by me in this mail and you feel a slight vibration from the concert. I agree that communiting by car is easier and faster than most of the public transportation; however, there are serious problems come after it; the amount of vehicles on the roads keep increase and make congestion and pollution which are far more severe than the inconvenience causing by public transportation. And these 'mistakes' are decided by the reader, a decision that censorship takes upon itself. Instead of choosing what books are seen by the public, perhaps libraries should just create an adult-only section to house the 'controversial' books; as a result, mankind would stay educated and free, and children would remain innocent. Other reason for my opinión is that almost all the people preffer use the visual sense and ear to other person more than write and listen for understand new things."	2.5
277	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Nowadays, public transport is used for many people in the cities, we can find different types of them, such as bus tube and train, but is there a future for it or not?, I am going to respond this question giving disadvantanges and advantages and  finally I give my personal opinion. About this, different people hold different views. Thank you  very much Joe for think in me for to be your witnees, I feel very proud that you think in me for to be your witnees and of course I accept and I will  be in Toronto for your wedding. In my opinion, I agree with it, that is, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. There have been a large number of smokers. Moreover also simple things are changed, for example the food we eat: some times ago everythingh was natural, healthy... but now everyone eat always ""junk food"" and thinghs like that, which are completely unhealthy ! What's more, some of them are addicted to it. They can't live without it. One day a man and his wife were trying to found a place shallow and without pollution for cultivate, they were poor; they don’t have the necessary sources, but the husband work so hard because his wife had an accident it occurred one day that his wife was working in a campaign of conservation of animal in endangered, she went to a place in search of animals, she heard a sound in a dark place of the jungle so she went to investigated what was that, a creature that have never seen attack she, her partner only heard a shout and they found Lucy the wife of the man in the floor, they ask she if she is ok but he don’t answered so her partner toke it to the doctor, there the doctor said that she was ok but he will never hear again or only if she paid 1 000 dollar for a operation. But nonsmokers hate it, they hate to smell it. They even complain that they inhale the second-hand smoke in restaurants that would greatly harm to their health. Therefore, it is really harmful to people in the restaurant. If difficulties was told to the families, the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation. I hate them who smoke at the restaurant. he took the money the second day , he finished the registration and started in writing the story after long time spending in writing and did good job he went to give his story to the international student magazine office ,he found out there are a notice on the door say that the competition has canceled, he came back vey sad and told me what happened .Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake . While I were in ANDRAPRADESH every year we have Christmas function in December although we are not interested to attend Drama they were not leave us without participation even simple character.They gave me a character like THE GOD .Firstly I never aware about how act and do this particular character.And from October to till December we practise everyday after our study hour up to eleven ""O""CLOCK.DAY BY DAY  I learn and finally I did my role well.Then I think myself why I wasted all my school days . Last but not least, it can pollute the clean air. Nowadays, more and more people come to know that smoking is bad for people's health. It can lead to lung cancer, and heart problem. Sometimes the employers do strike and we clients do not known in time as a result we can not get on time to work,that is one of the disadvantages of using public transport. Some of them also think that the law to ban people smoking can encourage them to give up smoking. Above all, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants."	2.5
278	Lifetstyle: Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"Otherwise the public transport don't pollute but the car pollute so for us travelling by car is better than travellng by public transport but for the atmosphere is better travelling by  public transport than travelling by car Even in a day, employers have reduced working hours to 8-9 hours. Then if you want we could go to the restaurant of the city later if you want we could fiand a job for three months, in my opinion a good job for three months I could be the waiter because the waiter get much money in the three months of the summer. Some say getting up early and finish early in the evening is better while others say getting up later and working until late at night is better. In my opinion, getting up early has several benefits. My favourit sport is football i love it so much when i was young i used to watch football and my favorite team is Barcelona i was play with my friends at the street and we was happy with that so much and after that we played at playground like really football i love Cristiano Ronaldo so much he is the best player at the world a few people telling me that messi is the best player but i feel angry when i hear that because that is not true so i looking forward to meet my best player one day its like a dream to me . In school, students must attend at 9 a.m, so waking up late is impossible. Likewise, company usually fixed their schedule from 9 to 6, so night workers will substituted with day workers if they try to follow their own schedule. Moreover infrastructures such as transportation and shopping stores stop their operation in late night. No matter what year, its lowest level always in Jan-Mar.May be because this paragraph of time the weather was cold, the purchaser greatly reduced.We can be seen from the diagram,  the highest peak in the has increased year by year, as the low as. In addition to main schedule of society, getting up early is good for physical health. Usually, night workers skip dinners or eat foods with low nutrition, while day workers eat healthy foods 3 times a day. while we are spendind good time watching TV our brain is not in calm, only in an other position different to that ones in the rest od the day.That's why I think that it's a good momento to see the thing through a new glass and that can be a very high opportunity. For example, day workers eat at restaurant in company, and night workers eat foods from delivery stores. But I think that the future is the public transport, we need preserve nature, this is an imperative for our world, then the solution have to take the point that the governments do more invest in public transport, so the people don´t need to get a car for being able to have a job and don´t need it for normal development of their lives. Although companies like start-ups shift their work hours to match the individual life rhythm, this new phenomenon is not widely adapted yet. Before this culture is settled, day workers will have high productivity than night workers who work in companies which have usual fixed schedule. I think one of my favorites sports of all is the atletism I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself, you have to be every day better than you where yesterday, it force you to improve every time, also is an exercise that help all your body, especially the legs because it gives them great strength, but also your hands because they have to be in a constant movement, and all the body in general because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and help you to have coordination. They matched with main schedule of society which is 9 to 6, and have healthy foods. In addition, stress is a clear disadvantage of compete because competitiors are trying to win and this can frustrates.But, some people do not think this like this and take it more simply Finally, I think that to compete in sports has some benefits and disadvantages, but when is controlated there are some benefits that help you to whole you life. Until working hours become elastic, getting up early is better strategy than night working."	2.5
279	Government: Some people think that governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology. Other people disagree and think that this money should be spent on more basic needs. Which of these opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Korea need money on developing computer technology

In these days, Korea has economical issue, that is, where should government use money. Some people say that money should be spent on basic needs because there are many people in Korea who cannot buy own home, eat food that they want. On the other hand, other people say that money should be spent on developing technology, especially computer technology. Thirdly,Public toilets has been opened for the public to elminate attitude of urinating in the public places.Town council not only encourage people to planting or garndening,it subsidise money for their green improvements.Example,free fertilizers,water pump failitiesand pesticides. First of all, developing computer technology can make future lives more convenient. Nowadays in the cities developed there are many possibilities for public transport, like bus, train, subway, tram etc.these options it's more economical than the car, the problem of the car is that normally the car is occupied for a person, when the car is prepared for to carry four or five people. Fifty minutes passed ,when my body no longer was sore.I decided to walk to the end.Constantly,I just walked like without terminal contest.While I strugged to walk.Finally,I saw a light to appeare my eyes and I woke up. Computer technology is strongly needed on these autonomous electronics; since autonomous electronics are moving by computer codes. It is a time when children must choose, which people are good or bad, which way they will go to difficult situation for example they will be drink alcohol or they will have fun without any suplements. when he come she start crying and thought he would break up with her and she did not give him a chance to talk or explain anything she started to cry louder and accused him of cheating that make michael astonished how she did not trust in him ,how she thought that about him and he told her that he can not stand that anymore he would break up with her and he left .Michael close the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake Companies like Samsung or LG are in the first group of the electronics, which computer technology is strongly needed. If government does not spend money to computer technology, Samsung or LG can lose their power in the market. That can cause the weakness of the South Korea on international trade market. Some arguments say that country can be more stable and stronger when its basic needs are enough. On the other hand, developing computer technology can make power in international market. Here are some tips about the Egyptian people  they are so kind ,friendly,stressed but have a lot of  problems now days the level of poverty, standard of level ,the fixed cost  is increasing dramatically and the purchasing power is decreasing. She told me not good at all, but my was good and she also added that you may got the chance and finally I got it.After three days later our result has been published and I got the chance but the girl didn't. Nowadays we use technology in every thing, from educations to making clothes, we use technology everyday and everywhere.Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful,useful and  important for development but todays generation is influenced whit technology that they have stopped to do other activities. Spending money on computer technology cannot affect to people's lives instantly. However, people can live better in the future."	2.5

"Dear local newspaper, I feel that the people using computers benefits our society. I feel this way because computers give people the ability to learn about far away places: and people have educational websites, and even allow people to talk online with other people. yes, i agree, if you planed the travelling for a long distation and for a long time you would prefer to do it on car, couse firstly you;ll spend less time, you travelling will be comfortable, you'll have a possibility to stop every where and for a long time, as you need. for example, lunch time travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emission of carbon mono oxide which is effected to red blood cells and irritate to breathing system. But, luckily we have computers so I was able to @ORGANIZATION2 on a computer and found a wodd or information on him and got an a plus on the project. But, the public transportation have a lot of future bacase a lot of reassons, first the time, if the place you want to reach finally is really far the different type of vehicles of public transportation will get you there faster than your car, also the complications about the field, like if you want to go from America to Europe there is no highway that cross the ocean you need an airplane and unless you have one, you will cannot reach travel between continents with your car, a different reasson is politics, because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska you will not need to pass through Canada, the commodity is a really important reasson because drive for 8 hours is exhausting and it will be unsafe also, the economics is a factor to, because the attrition of your car it will be more that in the normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do, it will be expensive that in public transportation. I went on a computer went on @CAPS1.com a get lots of imformation and got on a plus. But in some day tow guise with quad bike and they saw some thing wrong they sad what's that , they sow dead body , they skared and run to ther camp . Computer technologist @PERSON1 saids, ""@CAPS2 percent of the computers websites are educational. I also remember when i was in seventh grade the whole class went on @CAPS3. Her mom die because some things or someone drag her of the leg and drop it in a cave were other animals eat her. Last but not the least, computers allow people to talk with other people from around the world. Theres a website calle myspace.com and it allows me and other people to talk online around the world. FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY´S all begins in 1981 when freddy fazbear's pizza open, the establishment it's a pizza restaurant but this pizza restaurant in had robots, in 1981 there were four animatronics and their names are Chica , Foxy, Bonnie and Freddy. On the other hand the computer does have cons. Some kids go on unprohibited websites that are not for minors. Theres a website called @NUM1.com and it has shooting and killing games that are not for kids. Also, some people are computer addicts who stay on computers almost twenty four seven. The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots. What is your choice in these actions."	2.5

Although I love softball I feel that the memories you acquire from the times you have with your teammates, are the things you remember the most through out your softball career.

As my fifth year now approached I was looking forward to it, but when my dad came up with the idea that maybe I play for a team not as locally, that idea was also very enticing. I now faced a big dilemma either stay with the team I knew so well and continue to play with them until high school ended; or play with a team I knew nothing about, play with girls that might not like me, girls that were so much better then me, and looked down upon me. As I looked at the pros and cons of both teams I decided no; I would stay with the team that I knew so well and I would stay comfortable at where I was at. However, compared to the line of indoor swimming pool,the difference of seasonal achievement of ice cream van is considerably large.Overall,the achievement of ice cream van is better than the indoor swimming pool,from about 1100 to 5500. Did I really want to stay and be comfortable? Or maybe challenge myself to become a better player; maybe i could work hard enough, and have college scouts take a look at me and hopefully have me play for them later. First of all,swim can help your health.The research declined that swim can decrease disease.Second,swim can relax yourself.When you in the water,you will feel relax.Third,swim can get more friend.You can go to the swimming club,that is a way to meet people with interesting of same.You can try this sport from now on. As my dad and I drove to the field where I would try out for this team, my stomach was in knots. I wanted this team to like me, I was playing all the possible ways in my head I could greet them so i didn't sound snobby or a grump. As i didn’t found nothing, i went to the place he live at and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he care about so as i continued to go to his houes i notice he will alays go to tehe same house so i decidec to follow him to the house and i foun out he was dating a girl she might be his girlfrien so i finally gota an idea, i would drive him crazy just as he did with me, that way she will think he had problems on his mind and left him, but son i thougt about it again and realized that if i did that she will try to help him and they will be more united,  so i decided to drive them both crazy almost at the border of death,  jus as he did with me! I was so nervous my mouth began to feel sticky and have an odd taste to it, soon after my mouth became bone dry no taste, no flavor, just a sticky mess. The car then was stationary my dad looked at me and just said ""ready or not here we come"". Nervous began to take over my body my arms were shaking uncontrollably and I was second guessing every move I made, I even had troubles removing my seat belt. And the strengths and weaknesses in both of segmental and suprasegmental, I think it’s maybe the learning habit, when I heard a sentences, I would use many varieties of tone and manner to say the sentences again, therefore,I can easily be interpreted illustrations instructions the emotions and feelings. My first thought was to run; that was it I didn't want to go, I was done I wanted home I was ready to start my year with the @CAPS2, I just couldn't take it. so, i`m rely thinking left this sport.Everyday i get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends.i`m exercising more and more again to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world.i`m champion in my sport so, i`m seek to do all my effort to be the first one in the world.finally I did not find encourage of my family or my teachers. Each and everyone of them told me their names, there favorite color, and a small fun fact about themselves. I found myself laughing through out my whole try out, there were no awkward moments and I enjoyed my time there. no of all people could afford to make conveyenc by car .car is easy and cozy also but public transprt is fair is much affordable to all clasess of poeple public transport means mainly pubic bus.people used to travell long disistance by publis bus .it is possible to carry large number of people of different places to carry in bus. My year with this team was amazing I have friendships with these girls that I never would have discovered if I hadn't gone. In the end, large colleges admit largest number of students, so the student may do establishing friendships more from different nationalities, also it serves the community by graduating many students in various majors. Laughter played a very big role in the decision I made to play with this team, if I had just gone and tried out, and had I not had fun and laughed, I would have decided to play with the @CAPS2. Nowadays,an increasing number of people are concerned about the phenomenon that armland ,forest and wetland is disappearing for some long-term human activities,for instant housing and transport networks is builded by destroying the balance of environment."	2.5
282	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"In conclusion the public transport is very good and if it desapear it will be a big problem, is right that some times you need a private transport but apart from that the public transport is very use by people of all ages. Our society has been around computers so often that some peole will find it hard to even live without them. Computers have become something that people depend on. firstly, that private transport provide a comfortable mean to travelling from one place to another without sharing stranger people a way and by using this kind of transport also comfortable in free with choosing time of a trip. After waiting an hour the time comes and bravely  with high confident level he walke to the office. So they make a plan to display all... The next day when they were about to start filming they ere non ants there so they search for them, but they can't find them... In that moment the ants and Penny attack them in their backs, making them to leave the place. Computers posses the ability to do certain human tasks that seem hard for us to do. Before the computer age, it was a lot more difficult to find information on a topic or place. In modern life,we rely on traffic to work or travel to everywhere.It is conveninet to travel by private cars .The price of private cars which every one can afford it,so that everyone has the private car nowadays .Some people point out private cars are going to replace the public transport . Sometimes we would even have to travel to a place and learn about it. Today, however, people use technology to find this information. You @MONTH1 be thinking, "" @CAPS3, how is this a bad thing?"". The reason it is a problem is because people have begun to loose the ability to use books like encylopedias and atleses or even simmple maps. Once, most of the population could use these tools to help find their way through information or a place. I know from experienc, that I can barley look at a map and find where I am. There is not so much traffic, and my senses and lounges perceive and respire all the smell that flowers,  land, the First, I walk slowly and then I begin to walk as soon as possible to improve my fitness and I end walking 5 turns in the park. What would happen if someone got lost and they didn't have a working @CAPS4 or signal on their phones. They would get lost and not know how to read a map. As you can see the human population has because too dependent on computers. From the beginning of the world till now , human wants the fast income and the easy ways of live , so he tries more and more to find a solution for  his problems by creating a new ways of liveing more easy and more convenient  for him. Facebook, @CAPS6 and even @CAPS7 baseball have become an addicting activity that people consume all of their time with. Second advantage is Internet by website, such as twiter, facebook... You allow speak with your quick friend, or you can meet ith them by website, therefore you do not call by telephone, so internet is too much cheap. my favorite sport is swimming i swim 2 times per a week sometimes i go to the swimming pool in the same area which i work there and sometimes i go to the swimming pool of my cousin, i enjoy when i spend my time in the water and now even i am pregnant i am afraid when i swim with a group of people i keep telling them and screaming do not close with me ! If you took a survay of the number of students who have a facebook account or @CAPS6, you would probably get the majority. But now I really enjoyed, and me best friend both for me ticket for a theatre to see the musical show ,which was amazing, for cuople of hours I didn't move, was a brilliant present. Students, parents and everyone in between will find troubles later on because of this. America is one of the leading nations with obesity. Has anyone stopped to think that maybe people spend too much time on these websites to get any excersise? If the internet wasn't such a big thing it is now, I bet you there would be less overweight people. about my rest of family , as I said before they are just a relatives , but even if they are not friends almost ,but I do love them to much ,first one is my aunt ,the dead one ,and the other who still alive ,but i don't feel that felling of love towards my uncle , I do love him ,but he is just my uncle no more . My own sister spends so much time on her laptop that my parents had to take it away. the actions of this film took place in Alexandrie city of Egypt and it talks about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they didn't have much money to produce their own albums , that sort of bands is   famous between the youth and they call it ""under ground bands "" .their songs give a big concenet to the political and social stituation in Egypt and they become famous after the25 january revoulation , why I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society , there is no chance for the youth and if they found it , they face lot of problems to save it and they didn't find time for other activties and in sometimes they worked in thing which  they never learn or love For another,there are many different types of programs,which can broaden our eyes,they give details of education,plus other meaningful information，such as documentaries，talk show and so on.These programs are not just for killing the time,but for educating. think of all the people who you know that spend multiple hours on the computer. You can probably thnks of quiet a few. The island was flood but the island had a levee that prevent a flooding then in many year a engineers star constructing a building to had more money then in the city put many advertising in all thing : ball, balloon, movies ,etc. there was also a cup in it,It said""don't give up your dream,keep doing!go!we stand by you!come on""  Tom love it ,""thanks mom,thanks dad! Remember this next time you are someone you know sits down at a computer for a long time. You can help them."	2.5

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that the idea of advances in technology benefiting society is a very controversal topic. However, I support these advances in technology and I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They allow friends and family who live far away from each other to communicate and stay in touch. hello  my name is Mustafa I am 23 years old and I am Student in collage I search for job but I don't find a job I wish that my country become a great country and better and I wish to married who I love her  thank you In the long run, doing more things by computer instead of on paper will save billions of trees! @CAPS7, computers teach us hand-eye coordination which is a tremenciously important skill. Everyone eagerly waiting for the ambulance arrival but still not yet reached the reason is our college location is little far from the city that's why it is getting late. ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1!"" @CAPS3 computer wails as I recieve a video call from @CAPS3 cousin, @PERSON4. The advantage in technology has provided many new ways for @CAPS3 family and I to communicate with each other. We were all excited, those from Lala Band minunate.Their voices have positive vibration through their musical and give you a good feeling.On the scene moves very well and know how to take pleasure to the public.I am feeling wonderful and my promise is that when going to have a special occasion to go to a concert supported by Lala Band, you will be with me.As like this in all my heart.I hope as those recounted by me in this mail and you feel a slight vibration from the concert. Four out of five teenagers would agree that without computers or technological advances, their long-distance relationships with family and friends wouldn't be possible. For example; I go on oovoo once a week to video chat with @CAPS3 cousin whom I only see on holidays. Teen @CAPS4, @PERSON2 says: ""Technology such as computers and cell phones are great for teens, but it should be monitored and not used excessively."" Computers are great for keeping in touch with family and friends at a distance! Playing the cricket will also gives physical exercise to our body.we can bowl,batt,field in the cricket which  requires lot of  physical activities. It was a cold day at night when I was at home watching my favourite programme on my telly called ""dare to win"", I was with my brother, when we decided to call, The programme is about questions for the contestants that must be answer in correct time, and there is a different things for the winner. Environmentalist, @PERSON3 says: ""@CAPS5 more schools switched to online textbooks they would end up saving thousands of dollars that can be put elsewhere."" The future for the public transport shouldn't be  taken lightly,  in my opinion, the public transport is the best option for ending the problems with the traffic jam because when we use a bus or subway , a lot of people is travelling from one place at other in only one transport or vehicle. ""@CAPS5 we didnt have to take home so many textbooks everyday, I might not have scoliousis!"" I know that I am a suitable person for this job, and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job, because I have been travelled for all the world and in this experience, I have seen in the necesity on work to fiance my journey, so the I have dedicated to work on summer camps, and I have a lot of experience in this. In my school ages I did not participate any programme even sports.Because school teachers never encourage me to participate.If they told me to attend compulsory I will do without any hesitation. Third, this is the most important step that printed sheets manually inspected,the this sheets are classified three areas.The number one called good quality sheets,they will be packed and dispatched.The next called partially damaged shees,and bank notes separaed into good and bad, good sheets will be cutted into separate bank notes and packed,the bad one will be destroyed by fair.The number three called bad sheets ,they will be securely destroyed. Three out of five kids at @ORGANIZATION2 say that @CAPS5 they didn't have a computer growing up, they wouldn't be as good at their sport. For other hand, People make other inventions for improving the world and reduce pollution, for example, In this time we have created electric cars or organic food, these things are very useful in future, because we will need to reduce pollution."	2.5
284	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   Daejeon is one of the largest city in Korea, and it is usually called 'science city' since a lot of research centers and factories are there. My university, KAIST, is also in Daejeon. The students of KAIST can be benefited by the great infrastructure of Daejeon, but I sometimes imagine what would happen if KAIST were in Seoul. Being in Seoul should have some advantages, so if I have a chance to change something about my university, I would change the location of it. I'll suggest two reasons why I want to place KAIST at Seoul. First, the infrastructure of Seoul is better in general. Yet Daejeon has a well-structured infraware, that of Seoul is stiil better. In this shopping center I bought new blue skirt.After that we went our favorite art-cafe.We like it because cafe has beautiful design and tasty food .After that we went to walk on embankment.It is all our plan.Hope to hear from you soon! This difference can affect the welfare of students. he took the money the second day , he finished the registration and started in writing the story after long time spending in writing and did good job he went to give his story to the international student magazine office ,he found out there are a notice on the door say that the competition has canceled, he came back vey sad and told me what happened .Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake . The answer is simply; this museum has many types of momias.In 1810 have been a war for indepedent of Mexico many people were fight with other people; for example: Miguel Hidalgo is considerate: ""The father of indepedent"" and he was to fight with monarquia Spanish. To think in innovative way, it is usually better to experience new things in the earlier stage. This can be expecially true for KAIST students. I have joined football-teams which is near to my home, I prefer to this team because of my family is not reach, they can not provide for my transportation fees to go exercises stadium. my town tries all the time to make our town more beautiful and comfortable by taking more care of the environment,they provide us by good buses which are friends to the environment and offer the tickets for this buses in a cheap price,they also trying to find the best way to make the rubbish more useful by the recycling,also the people tries all the time to find the best way for keep our village clean;they never throw the rubbish in the streets or the gardens,also they take care of the fuel in their cars to not to be bad for the environment,so,it's our duty to take care of our village and the whole environment beside the government. In addition to its infraware, the invironment of Seoul is more diverse than Daejeon. Daejeon has specialized in science, but not in the other fields. On the other hand, Seoul has specialized in culture, tourism, and researches, as well as science. Being in Deajeon, KAIST students cannot get much chance to experience such things except science. An day in the morning Paxton waited to Long y the writer, but he listened that called him suddenly he goes for the beach and is killed for the shadow Tennis, tennis is not jsut a sport anyone can play but it's professional sport needs to more hard trainee and more time to be perfect in it, in first why I choose tennis?, seriously in 2003 this is my first time to watch the game on TV when I saw roger federer played I think he is the one that made me love this sport, due to it's professional motion in playing the ball, from this time I was interested in this game and watching all championship, so more time, time and time it was my favoirite sport. In conclusion, KAIST can be better off if it moves to Seoul, by taking advantage of Seoul's great infrastructure and diverse environment. Because you are the best teacher in the whole world!many of our class classmate really like you too!We know that you are going to teach  Discovery-bay  primary school .My English result is  better once  you taught me I really love you, Ms Cumings!your friend Ms Decock told me that  she is going to Australia ,and I love you two both I hope you that you will come back some times ! Life is unpredictable and unforseen.The immense possibilities of life  give us opportunity to explore life but some times   it lead to threat and dangers to our life.We surely pray for the best life of our dear and near ones.But insurance is also necessity and invetable for peace of mind .It gives us surety to live life securely.It just not only to save our life but also secure assets like houses cars etc. One day many years ago in something place that a don't remember the name I woke up one morning more earlier than usual then I went to the kitchen and shout the name of my mother...but no one answered, and the first thing that I imagine is that they come to the town, quickly I went out to find they... But there was no one, absolutely no one, I'm scary, I yell and scream, look and look but I had no result  Suddenly I felt a warm hand that touched my shoulder and very slowly turn but the only thing I saw was a shadow that was holding a knife     I woke up and realised it had all been a bad dream"	2.5
285	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     My university is KAIST, one of the best universities in South Korea. I'm proud of my university. In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that doesn't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used,so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground. Although healthy diet is quite expensive young people follow special diet in order to have better body shape or healthy life.Actually modern life affected on our palate changing .Instance some people who work majority of their waking houres prefer to use fast food more.Our commitments imposes us to forget ourselves and our healthy . There's so many inconvenient points that I think redesigning is the only answer. So, I'll discuss why I want to redesign the Silloe Hall of KAIST. Life is unpredictable and unforseen.The immense possibilities of life  give us opportunity to explore life but some times   it lead to threat and dangers to our life.We surely pray for the best life of our dear and near ones.But insurance is also necessity and invetable for peace of mind .It gives us surety to live life securely.It just not only to save our life but also secure assets like houses cars etc. First,  the Silloe Hall is too old. Almost part of the Silloe Hall is not in fine condition. Wall of building can't block humidity from outside. Rooms are too small. Peter drove his car to the doctor's clinic and after half an hour he arrived and he and his grandmother go above through the stairs to reach the doctor's clinic after they arrived they found that they have to stay aperiod of time to take his turn they waited and then their turn came .they entered the doctor and the doctor was very kind he welcomed them and after check    peter's grandmother. Travelling by using any transport has become in one of our needs, in the past people used to take hours waiting for the public transport, now, we can afford any of those modern car at the agency. The first two step is to design with background color artwork and security issues and prepare metal plates with skilled machinists.Then there are some requirments for printing sheets:color on both sides, special ink and images slightly raised.The most essential and key process is manual inspections for printed sheets with three categories: good quality sheets, patially damaged sheets and bad sheets. Until May, drying machine in first floor was out of order. There are more things which is out of order in the Silloe Hall. you must think a little bit before you talk as  one word causes a lot of pain for others for the rest they lives .you may not  actually notice that but you  will feel what am really mean if  someone tells you a painful words . Then if you want we could go to the restaurant of the city later if you want we could fiand a job for three months, in my opinion a good job for three months I could be the waiter because the waiter get much money in the three months of the summer. We as a human who live in these days , we live rely on technolgy, every aspect of our live are supporting by technolgy. Because of its orientation, half of the rooms in the Silloe Hall face sun for the entire afternoon, and half of the rooms in the other side of the Silloe Hall can't face sun forever. My room is always in shadow, too. Third, Silloe Hall is too far from outside. Because cooking inside the dormitory is impossible, I and my friends usually order food with delivery application. But, some restaurants which delivery food with motorcycle can't reach Silloe Hall. A few minutes ago,some boy who looks  like elderly than my old brother closed to the poor little boy,the little boy stopped cried,he looked on some boy,my brother felt afraid because they look like rube,but he still  wanted help the little boy. It's too far. To sum up, if I could change one thing about my university, I would redesign the Silloe Hall because it's too old, its orientation is strange, and its too far from outside."	2.5
286	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"I wholeheartedly agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the entire country. Of all the places to smoke, why at a restaurant anyway? First and foremost, smoking has never done anything good to anyone. Nobody benefits from smoking. In other way, I never be a witness , what I have to do?, tell me what cain of suit have the witnees have to wear, If I have to buyany colour of tie, the flower.... really I'm very exciting with your wedding. The smoke, the smell, all of it hazardous to the health of the smoker and even more to those who inhale the smoke second handedly. Moreover, smoking just contributes even more to the already polluted air around us. Second, since cleanliness in restaurants should always be maintained, there is no reason not to kick out smokers. Secondly, do more cooperation between countries.To illustrate, people should cooperation To intervene to bring peace to the world to stop the war in many areas like what United Nations doing.For example, United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy . Smoking in restaurants simply spreads the dust, and all the other dirty particles all over the place. One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance,  homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society. television serves the multipurpose of entertaining and educating people.in order to cope up the competiting world and get recognized in the corperative world one must strive hard,which in turn increases their stress levels.Television has become one of the means to reduce the stress levels.besides providing entertainment television has also become a source of information. Who knows? I agree that communiting by car is easier and faster than most of the public transportation; however, there are serious problems come after it; the amount of vehicles on the roads keep increase and make congestion and pollution which are far more severe than the inconvenience causing by public transportation. No one would want their children to experience that just before entering a restaurant. One night,as usual,I slept.In a flash,I rolled down from a mountain and I didn't know where I was.It just a very long tunnel where was dark and strange,After,I felt my body ache.I began to yell that hoped someone could  save me to leave from here. My favourit sport is football i love it so much when i was young i used to watch football and my favorite team is Barcelona i was play with my friends at the street and we was happy with that so much and after that we played at playground like really football i love Cristiano Ronaldo so much he is the best player at the world a few people telling me that messi is the best player but i feel angry when i hear that because that is not true so i looking forward to meet my best player one day its like a dream to me ."	2.5
287	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"KAIST is an university with a dormitory. Many students stay here, during the semester. Especially, it is mandatory for first-year students to stay at school dormitory. Since we can't cook in our rooms, we usually go out or order food by delivery to have meals. ""Annabelle"" is a horror movie which i am going to watch this Saturday.I am wondering if i will be scared after the movie.The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was closed in a museum from Conecticut where she is visited  by a preist  who blesses her twice a month.John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife :a beautifull colection doll dressed in a wedding dress.Unfortunatelly,in a horribble night the couple""s house was invided by a satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them.The satanists invoced an eavel entity that is capabale of the worst things...Annabelle.After Mia gives birth to her doughter Lilly,Annabelel wants to kill her.Even the preist doesn's know how to help the unhappy familly.Everyone is terryfied and find out that a demon is attached by the doll.Idon't know the end of the story but i don;t think that is a happy one... But school meals are receiving negative feedback, so I would like to change school meals. First, KAIST meals are more expensive than other universities. They're cheaper than restaurants, but students feel pressure to have three meals a day at the cafeteria. I grew up in a parent family.Sometimes I felt that I was alone and not loved.However,we were lucky enough to have a great mother who tried  all her best to keep my older brother，my older sister and I for completing our college studies .Of course my uncle ,young brother of my mother gave a big hand to go through the hard,so that made us often help each other in my family when the member who was in hard.Especially I was the youngest member in the family ,made much more troubles when I was young . As KAIST meal is expensive, food is a lot, so I often leave food behind, which is inefficient. Secondly, the quality of food is decreasing. Dear all I Am communicating to you, with the purpose of let yo know that we will set up a meeting at  my office with the purpose of discuss how we  could use social media to improve the Communication with our suplliers, i think a great time for the meeting could be next Monday at 4:00 p.m Kind regards Armando Martínez Therefore students are looking for instant foods, that is cheap and guaranteed to be tasty. hello  my name is Mustafa I am 23 years old and I am Student in collage I search for job but I don't find a job I wish that my country become a great country and better and I wish to married who I love her  thank you Finally, diversity of meals are also needed.

Coat of arms of the city of Rybinsk is a scarlet heraldic shield,over which - green with golden beach pier for which the output is black rebelling bear holding in the left leg on the left shoulder golden ax, undertwo silver starlet One day a man and his wife were trying to found a place shallow and without pollution for cultivate, they were poor; they don’t have the necessary sources, but the husband work so hard because his wife had an accident it occurred one day that his wife was working in a campaign of conservation of animal in endangered, she went to a place in search of animals, she heard a sound in a dark place of the jungle so she went to investigated what was that, a creature that have never seen attack she, her partner only heard a shout and they found Lucy the wife of the man in the floor, they ask she if she is ok but he don’t answered so her partner toke it to the doctor, there the doctor said that she was ok but he will never hear again or only if she paid 1 000 dollar for a operation. I'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant its name is ""Lemon"" I go there every week it has different food from any restaurants I'd like chicken crispy with garlic sauce It's Excellent choice for me and My favorite appitizer is susage and in order that desert I'd rather ""Vadge"" cake with chocolate sauce I feel I;m at ease when I go there I enjoy  classical music over having a lunch about the service It's very good and all staff are respectable I can't imagine one week without going there that drives me nuts I advise any one to go there and enjoy  a time there , also this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really It's  excellent This strikingly thing for anyone  despite all of these advantages prices are not expensive . Expecting these positive effects, I would like to change KAIST's school meals."	2.5
288	Lifestyles: Some people prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day’s work. Others prefer to get up later in the day and work until late at night. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.	"There should be a plan in your life
These days, in Korea, people focus on success by taking risks, such as investing in virtual money like BitCoin, not by plan and steady work. As the society becomes more stabilized, as side effects, the ladder of the class movement collapsed, and this kind of atmosphere has been widely spread. i like volei because it was part of my life and of life of my mother, is my favorite sport, but i like over sports too, same i don't play volei because I'm bad, and my friends that know, don't like of  peoples bad of volei.I'm watching they playing, they're really very good, but when play over school, they're very bad However, if someone wants to succeed in life, planning with careful thoughts should be accompanied, not only by taking risks. My favourite sport is playing tennis.I play it three times a week (on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays) in the club of tui.I had been playing tennis from 2 years ago with two of my best friends.I enjoy playing tennis because it is a sport that requires skills, concentration and speed.I am not very good at all but I like to play it with my friends and do matches on Saturdays . In one or two cases, it can be successful; however, from the view of probability, as the risk-taking times get larger and larger, the probability of collapse becomes close to 100%. My town is very beautiful and I like it very much because it is not any dirty streets in it  The governor of my city seek to develop it and he said it will be the capital of delta actually after 30 years ago the people in my town deal with rubbish by healthy method , the citizens collecting the rubbish and threw it in big boxes far away the city. This is the simple and most important logical reason why people should focus on planned life. Some people say that a tripp by car is more convenient that by the public transportation, but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations.It is true that travel to a nearby place from your city, it  is more comfortable getting there by car, and the ease of have your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time paying  cabs. For example, if most people focus on investing their all savings in BitCoin, and do not work, the company will not be able to make money, and it will directly become the reason for the depression. To make society work efficiently,  society needs earnest workers, not gamblers. To sum up,  in the point of one person and the society, people should focus on planned working, not gambling. Above all,the design is the most previous way we should know,which is considered with the background color and artwork.Secondly,we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinsts.And the we need printing and inspection.Eventually,the most essential part comes out,we need significate the quality of the sheets.If it's good,packing and distributin whereas the others shoulde be distroyed as well. This kind of person says that ""Life is one shot, friend."" Of course, on the way to success, some risks exist because life is so complex and hard to predict."	2.5
289	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Wherever you go, you may certainly find people smoking especially at restaurants. Smoking has become a wide spread phenomenon. Men, women and even children have the habit of smoking. We don't have the right to stop them from smoking, but the law can decide where they can smoke and where they can't. Sizdehbedar: It means Thirteenth day of spring , on this day people going picnic and spent the day out of  their homes on the nature because they believe that Thirteen number that brings bad luck for them . Nowadays,an increasing number of people are concerned about the phenomenon that armland ,forest and wetland is disappearing for some long-term human activities,for instant housing and transport networks is builded by destroying the balance of environment. It is harmful to our body especially the lung, the smoke smokers release also does harm to nonsmokers. Restaurants are public places where people have meals, the environment must be clear, smoking in the restaurants not only pollute the environment but also pollute the food, what's more, smoke can spread freely in the restaurant, that's to say, all the customers in the restaurant will suffer the awful gas, so the quality of environment cannot be assured, let alone enjoying the meal. Firstly, the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel.Secondly, the public vehicle route are more far than usual route.Thirdly,it is also crowded and no privacy.Finally,there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker. Only do like that can we enjoy our meals in the restaurant delightedly."	2.5

"However, compared to the line of indoor swimming pool,the difference of seasonal achievement of ice cream van is considerably large.Overall,the achievement of ice cream van is better than the indoor swimming pool,from about 1100 to 5500. I do not go to companies to work as a admin stuff during my weekend, but instead I have been working as a tuition teacher, and a kinder gymnastics trainer. I enjoy both of my jobs very much as not only does it pay well; it also is really fun and interesting to interact with the children. Their ages for the kinder gymnastic classes ranges from pre-nursery to k2s. the kids are extremely cute when they recognizes you and try to be close to you. The small talks with them have also been very interesting. It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swimming and also when the age become older it will be more difficult to learn than the little . Another ones which were bad sheets and bad bank notes from damaged apparently,would be destroyed securely.This was the whole working process of the bank notes and it was consist of 7 steps. I would find this job more tiring but nevertheless, they are still interesting people. I remember feeling extremely lazy to go and teach tuition after a long day in school. However, I still had to be responsible enough to go.

And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"So I do not have opptunity to practical English Because most of my colleagues speak French.They speak French in the meeting, in the gearm, and in the shopping Removing things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., that are found offensive could be both good and bad. For other hand, People make other inventions for improving the world and reduce pollution, for example, In this time we have created electric cars or organic food, these things are very useful in future, because we will need to reduce pollution. Although, it could be bad because it takes away from freedom of choice. Transportation is very important in cities,villages as well as in sub-lines.Many people has no vehicles,they only depends on public transport due to some reasons.Any way in some cases,car is very useful to reach the destination very fast. I used all of the things except two.I didn't have the Internet when I was child.And also we couldn't choose  programmes.I played in the street and walked to school alone.I'm thinking what kind if things were more dangerous for me?It was so dangerous when my friends and I swam in the Tobol river.We jumped into the water and caught crayfish.When I remember that moment I am exciting.I guess everychild want to investigate the world.We have to help them,to show and explain.What kind of risks they can get if to do that. Protecting your children from things that offend you, @MONTH1 stop them from growing up badly. Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there. Censoring or removing things that you find offensive @MONTH1 be a good idea. There are plenty of reasons someone @MONTH1 want to do this. A parent @MONTH1 not want their child to read, hear, or see something simply because it offends them. so, on my opinion, even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers Parents know that most young children don't know right from wrong, so they'd like to make that choice for them. cars are faster than public transport so cars are more convenient than public transport it is easier ,faster and more comfortable especially in long distances so governments should improve public transport as not all people have cars Tottaly l think changing is ignorable but we can control it to make our life better,specially about food that is most important aspect of ourlife but we don't pay attention to it enough. One day I visit my friend Jimmy in New York city, he was a young man who was specialist on trains and tourism, he talked about how the citizens and the commuters move from one place to another, he told me that the grand central terminal was the largest terminal of the city,he show me were the landmarks of the big apple were so sightseers could go,he show me the city and we went to different parts first he took me to Columbus circle in the south west corner of central park were there were the most expensive apartments then we went to the lake were the jogging tracks that circle the lake area popular with early morning visitors,then we went to the museum of natural history that was located near the metropolitan museum of art then I got focal on the subway trains so we went to Grand central terminal when we arrive I was amazed to see many people going to work so he told me that it was conveniently for people to use the train because is very fastest and for the government it was a grat economic business then he told me that one of the characteristics of Removing offensive material from shelves would take away from a person's freemdom of choice. Who wants to be told what they can and cannot read? If a parent does this to their child, it just sheltering them from the world around them. A child should be able to know the life around them before they grow up and are completely lost. Most illiterate people choose their proficiency as  public  transportations like ,bus service, cab service, auto service....etc, in order to full fill their basic needs.People with more  unemployment may also lead to a crime rate . When really, protecting them could be harmful. i know that i am not professional player and i am n't belong to any team  but i like this game .basketball is so simple play but it is need Speed ,concentration and The ability to determine the distances  , it  contains of two team of five player and each team try to get a high point by throwing the ball through the basket. Offensive music, movies, books, ect., have already been bought and sold for years. public transport has a big role in transportation specially in large cities like Capital city of countries,  using the car some times causes traffic jam if all person uses their own car, to avoid this a good roadways is needed, also the cost of public transportation is lower than private transportation. It doesn't give people a choice. If the public transport will be by higher quality, faster and fewer rates, majority of citizens will be prefer: is more calm to relax and read a newpaper or a magazine during the way in a collective transport than an indiivdual one; moreover, the time spend up to go and came back will be reduced, because it promotes less car in the railway. Music is made for the enjoyment of the people. Some people like their music to talk about drugs or curse, why take that away from them? It just wouldn't be fair to take a choice away from someone. A movie is just a movie, it's not real. Just because something is done in a movie doesn't mean that a person will go off and do it. all my class called me creep ugly geek but still little good only when a teacher want from them a research or the exams are next couple days but Michael trying to stop me doing that because they never become my friends and i was bigger to do this things ;    that day i just finish help younger student to understand his  math lesson  My friend Michael asked me to do the same to give her answer sheet for all final exams i was in bi shook why she  want that from me  any way i collect my courage told her that was wrong and become to do that in college better to start study  now and I'll help her to study the hard lessons (i was very sad to say no & she asked me that)she become very angry and told me i should help her because we she was my best Friend then i told her that why i told her NO and she told me i hate you Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there. If people stopped to think about it, they would realize that offensive material has already been bought by others. Plenty of people have illegaly downloaded, or bought music that uses inapropriate language. on the other hand, public transportation takes more time to get to the required station, because already public transport taking long path to go across more places and as more as peoples take benefits from it, and public transport usually crowed and do not be on time. Books that some @MONTH1 find offensive have already been printed and sold to others. Secondly, studying in university, I have to live far from house which make me be homesick, sad, and worried I have to live in dormitory with many strange friends, they ‘re very noisy and I have to share my room with my roommates. They are called below: 1- chaharshanbeh soori 2- Norouz 3- sizdehbedar  chahrshanbeh soori:  It meaning Tuesday night of week and take place on last Tuesday night of the year .at this night people make a bonfire and jump over the fires and say to fire :I give you my sign of sickness(yellow color)and you give me your healthy sign (red color)and eat some special foods . If the  print sheets has good quality ,they will packing and distribution.some partially damaged  will cut into separate or packede or dispatched .The bad sheets will disposal ,the destroyed will be secure. So, why censor things now, when there's already unremovable offensive material out?"	2.5
292	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Specialize in One Subject is Mandatory
     Recently, many discussions regarding how to educate students have been made. One topic in the discussion is about whether students have to specialize in one subject or take classes in various subjects. Further to the trade fair of the last week where we were a pleasure to meet you and we were talking about you courses. for example, lunch time travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emission of carbon mono oxide which is effected to red blood cells and irritate to breathing system. people ,espicially grnerator's owner, start using Canaopies, using very long pipes to get rid off as possible as they can from the polution. This implies that finding someone who can take care of all parts of the problem is impossible. Instead of one convergence talent, lots of experts from various areas cooperate to handle one big problem by solving small, but complex components of the problem. If difficulties was told to the families, the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation. Next, training experts is more efficient. There are many accidentally problems encountered by international students studying in Australia.It is believed that the most important one of the problem is culture barrier.Because of different culture backgrounds,the talking  style of internaional students who come from different countries are various. About 2 or 3 centuries ago, scholars of that era studied about many areas; mathematics, physics, and chemistry and so on; however, as humans accumulate their knowledge, the research area has become deeper and more complex than in past days. This fact makes educating enough level of convergence talent much harder. One of the example is television, in the past we use it only for watching news and movie, but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t, now television has others function. I just finish my lunch time, and before prepare everything to go to work I was thinking of you and I wanted to give you a small surprise with this fantastic photos, I hope you like it. Some argue that training leaders who can understand and integrate ideas from various area is more important in modern era; however, such talented leaders can be easily replaced by cooperation of experts. However if this situation not change and if our government not take providence about this important subject will be the end of the transport public and will more convenient to use car. Instead, cooperation of specialists takes its place. Modern problems can be handled by cooperation of many specialists. In order to reuse, I convert all thing reusable,for example,plastic bottle as a plant pot; glass bottle as a food container;I bring my reusable shopping bag and refuse to use a shopping plastic if a salemen offer me to bring. This first reason is all actors shown their talent in this film directly and audience can follow their steps and the story certainly, this essential element which also makes a big success to the film. In modern era, training convergence talents is not competitive anymore. Therefore, we should encourage students to specialize in one subject than taking multiple kinds of subjects."	2.5

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Wouldn't you agree that computers have a great affect on people. The three reason why they have a good affect on people is because, it gives you good typing skills, its educational, and it helps you out with alot of things. The first reason why computers have a good affect on people is because computers help your typing skills. If you have a computer you will soon learn that your typing skills get very good. Each time you use the computer your hands ajust to the keys on the computer. Say if there is someone that wants to work with computers when they get older, well if they practice their typing on their computers at home they will be eligible for the job working with computers.

Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , that ha has planned two weeks ago  this episode was his sister's birthday ,"" Now it is the suitable moment to announce her about surprise "" peter said . Another reason why computers have a good affect on people is because they are very educational. One night,as usual,I slept.In a flash,I rolled down from a mountain and I didn't know where I was.It just a very long tunnel where was dark and strange,After,I felt my body ache.I began to yell that hoped someone could  save me to leave from here. For example, what food people eat in different countrys, or where that country is. Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real. Ask.com is the best website because it tells you what ever you want to know in a matter of seconds. Computers are also educational when it comes to school projects because of these amazing websites. The last reason why computers have a affect on people is because they help you with alot of things. No all is good some people haven't got money can't go to another place to another place and the pollution became more and more, it is a serious problem and the solution is only for the rich people, the solution is buy an electric car, the other solution, more economic, is the government give the money to the population to buy an electric car. I know your probably thinking there is such thing as a gps, well if you think about it gps's can be confusing, but your computer reads it out to you. We can really confirm that there is no future for public transport, if so, we will have to drive a car instead of buying a ticket for public transport and go to office, city, home and so on using private transport, however we can also think that in the centre has no parking car or it is not enough for the whole private car, thereby, if we use a public transport, we can simplify our lives and spend less simply because we are able to save money and time. football is a fameous sport you can whatch it on tv or yo can see it on direct.there ara a lot of  level categories, the most fameous categorie is the first. it can never be regained even the strongest monarchs have been helpless to prevent time.So should be careful about the importance of time .I hope to not waste it and use it as the best use for giving opportunity for rising .Those who waste it ,will be behind and they will fail to make a mark in their life.The great men and successful guys became fame and rose by a suitable use for time .They guide and source of inspiration for a new generation.

Books are filled with great stories of far-away lands, accounts of real events, and poems with powerful meanings. All of those books were written by an author with a clear point to make. One of the example is television, in the past we use it only for watching news and movie, but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t, now television has others function. Children have to learn these things some time in their life and I think the earlier they learn the less trouble it will cause them later in life. There are also freedoms in the @LOCATION1 that grant us freedom of speech. Shouldn't there be a freedom to read as well? one day Michael decided to make a surprise party to sinha to make her happy and feel his love more so he arranged everything and to keep it surprise to her he was busy all the time and did not show off all the week as usual .that make sinha worried and suspect that Michael do not love her any more and know another girl and she become extremely sad and even it become worse when Michael asked her to go to his apartment to make  the surprise to her  but he did not answer his phone after that . Without them, there would be no books for anybody to read. We should all respect authors and what they put into their books. Its very simple and wonderful sport.If you play cricket you are surely going to burn many bad calories adhered inside your body.In India cricket is worshipped and players are the lord.The best part of this game is you can play with every age group at a single time.I was very interested in making my career through this but due to my studies I can't take effort toward this. But I think that the future is the public transport, we need preserve nature, this is an imperative for our world, then the solution have to take the point that the governments do more invest in public transport, so the people don´t need to get a car for being able to have a job and don´t need it for normal development of their lives. i dont think the public transport does not have future, there are a lot of people who can not buy a car and has to use the communite transport. I remember wandering around my public library scanning the rows of books and reading the titles. There were books about politics, religion, sex, and violence. However on the other side of the library, there were books about children escaping their own world and traveling through time in a magical tree house. As I told you before because of the technology many things has become able in less time, and with the pass of the years this tend to increase. The library is great because of the plethora of knowledge contained in the unrestricted inventory of books. Hi,I am Amy.I would like to spend two months studying in English,two months doing volunteering in children charity and the least two months travelling in UK.What do you think of my plan?I will not only improve my English skills but also devote myself to get along with children.The most important of all,I will take an adventure to the unknown place in UK.I am looking forward to seeing you soon.I would like to invite you to join the road trip with me.it must be an amazing experience if we are together for this trip.As long as you can go with me just let me know. I then formed my own personal opinions on what I gathered from the books. Without those books in that library I would have never been able to research those topics. We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben, which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye.To got to the Big Ben we took the underground, but to get to the London Eye a red bus.After 3 days we went home.I forgot to tell you something about homeless people.A lot of people are homeless, which is sad, but maybe we can change it.

Libraries should allow every book in their collection because every book has some sort of value. Taking a book out of a library because of offensive material is not right because books are important no matter what is inside of them. Some books @MONTH1 have material that might not belong in the hands of children. Children need to learn those things sometime in their life. Why not now? Books are what have taught all of us. Please let them keep teaching"	2.5

She told me not good at all, but my was good and she also added that you may got the chance and finally I got it.After three days later our result has been published and I got the chance but the girl didn't. Computers are a waste of time and they keep family and friends from spending time together. Finally, computers can be very dangerous. for carreer has 80% under 26 years old students are taken it, for the age over 49 years old only has 20%people are taken; but if you counper interest, it is totoly different; for under 26 years old have only 10%; but for over 49 years old it has 70%. To start off, computers take away from excercising and spending time outside. I know if I had to choose between looking at a boring computer screen all day and going out for a run; I'd choose the run anyday. Computers don't keep people fit and healthy so they should find something else to do instead. The biggest anecdote, that I have with my friend, was our trip to Disney world.Where we could visit all the parks of Disney , like Animal Kingdom ,Hollywood studios and Magic kingdom.In adittion we could visit others parks, like Universal and Bush Garden. I had a terrible experience in this Chinese New Year!Because Norovirus infected me!At first,I had a high fever but I thought if I take some medicine I will be fine.Therefore,my condition took a sharp turn for the worse.I cannot eat anything even in New Year's Eve and I was so tired that I cannot play poker with my cousins.Though everythings were depressing,I still have a wonderful winner vacation with my family:we went to  Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village(九族)to visited its blooming cherry blossom. For example, walking the dog, or kicking the soccer ball around. You see, there are many things you can do other than going on the computer. In modern life,we rely on traffic to work or travel to everywhere.It is conveninet to travel by private cars .The price of private cars which every one can afford it,so that everyone has the private car nowadays .Some people point out private cars are going to replace the public transport . I know you can video chat and instent message them, but @CAPS3't you rather spend time with them in person? my favorite sport is swimming i swim 2 times per a week sometimes i go to the swimming pool in the same area which i work there and sometimes i go to the swimming pool of my cousin, i enjoy when i spend my time in the water and now even i am pregnant i am afraid when i swim with a group of people i keep telling them and screaming do not close with me ! Theres is a lot of things kids can do with their friends and families instead of using the computer. for carreer has 80% under 26 years old students are taken it, for the age over 49 years old only has 20%people are taken; but if you counper interest, it is totoly different; for under 26 years old have only 10%; but for over 49 years old it has 70%. I garentee they will enjoy these activities more then staring at a computer screen for @NUM5 hours. I went to a  awesome concert of points of view and I know that I look forward to telling you how it was.But let me tell you it was a concert that the  performed Lala Band and I have taken and I especially, I was the cameraman.It was an excellent night.The concert was evening began at 20:00 and came a lot of persoane. People have been killed because they don't know who they are talking to. Kids go on myspace and put up pictures and posts, but they don't realize that everyone can see what they said. It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. After two years that his essay was released, he will understand that his essay was wrong moreover, Michael will want to apologise many people who read his essay thereby Michael now goes home, takes a cup of tea, goes to bed thus Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake No all is good some people haven't got money can't go to another place to another place and the pollution became more and more, it is a serious problem and the solution is only for the rich people, the solution is buy an electric car, the other solution, more economic, is the government give the money to the population to buy an electric car.

"It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs.In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us.In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable. The main reason why I am against keeping computers around is because the people that use them the most are neglecting their families as well as their friends. The second reason why I am against keeping computers around is because they are too time consuming. Last but not least, I am against keeping computers around because people are spending too much time on the computers and less time exercising. I reduce use of innecesary power at home, in other words,I turn on light that I need for the while i use it;I take less warm shower; I hit only neccesary rooms. Computers are very addicting, so I can understand why people would neglect their loved ones for them, though I can understand why certain individuals do it I dont think its right. Looking for any sport make you feel good and your brain be always refresh so that you  can begin your day with any sport to making fresh and after that you can make any job with refreshment mind. When anyone miss to pass the ball or miss scored a goal we shouting on his face are you crazy how you missed this goal !

We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben, which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye.To got to the Big Ben we took the underground, but to get to the London Eye a red bus.After 3 days we went home.I forgot to tell you something about homeless people.A lot of people are homeless, which is sad, but maybe we can change it. Now, lets talk about all the time that is being consumed by computer users. Dear USA Summer camp I reply to your advertisement for work with children this summer in summer camps, have looked after children aged 5-10 and it was a fantastic experience, worked at school in north Africa like a volunteer and learnt a lot about children,  think that i'm a suitable person for the job because use to be an energetic and cheerful person and very hardworking, love working with children and  like organising several types of activities, I'm not very good cooking but i can learn very fast. Fortunately  Kabul structured  by Mountains and have mountainous climate, approximately this town  have 15 (mm) Raining per year the remarkable Agricultural area and forestry all around the town have a positive effect for the Kabul city environment and producing  Fresh air for the citizens of the mentioned town At first, I had called a travel agent but he said he couldn’t be able to book me a flight before two months, so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent. When I read the above statistics I came to grips with the fact that people spend too much time on the computer doing nothing. Now, lets talk about exercising a bit more. This sport cause fresh and jolly me and I think will exercise cause healthy.if you start volleyball, you need a ball and piece of ground that separate with tie. By me knowing that I am aware of the fact that children are not exercising. Exercise is very important for a growing child, and if they are not getting all the exercise that they need it can cause health problems in the future,. We were all excited, those from Lala Band minunate.Their voices have positive vibration through their musical and give you a good feeling.On the scene moves very well and know how to take pleasure to the public.I am feeling wonderful and my promise is that when going to have a special occasion to go to a concert supported by Lala Band, you will be with me.As like this in all my heart.I hope as those recounted by me in this mail and you feel a slight vibration from the concert. The above reasons tell you why I believe that exercise is more important than spending time on the computer. Now, lets bring this letter to an end."	2.5
297	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"    Who is the most influencing person to young adults? It is a very big controversy between people. Some people think family influences more, but others think friends are more influencing young adults. Nowadays, the transportation become more prefect,and the people'life become more convenient.Althought this change lend the life of people efficient,the problem should not be ignored.It would really be helpful if the government make tighter resrictions,in today's world ,lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission, they are destroyed the forest,farmland and wetland,charging waster water and emitting greenhouse gas,it lead to a serious enviorment problem.So the government should oversee this companies ,and if companies do not obey the rules or laws ,it will be fined and closed. First of all, young adults can share deeper concerns with friends. While growing up, every person suffers from numbers of situations and changing environments among them; however, they cannot share all the concerns with family. For instance, if someone had a problem with classmates, family cannot help effectively for her, even if they knows the fact. What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player ,i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families, It is very difficult to deny the importance of family in our life,  definitely families play an essential role community structure .According to the experts we can't create  successful society without creative families , and one another specific part of your life is a good partners surrounding your daily activities. Like this example, some concerns that cannot be handled by family occurs to people; for this reason, young adults share these with friends instead of family. During this period, Young adults share happiness, sadness, and numerous emotions with friends. Talking about lots of situations, which cannot be shared with family, makes friends as the most important influencing people on young adults. Next, friends can provide a new perspective on young adult's life. Some people may say that because family knows many things about young adults, family can give good effect on them compared to friends. hello, i want the job for the summer camp i'm looking for children between 8-12 years old i will help to organise sports and evening activities and if you want i could work in the kitchen if i have the job write soon                                                                   victoria I can tell you that I fell I can understand over 90% when I'm listening and when I´m Reading, but my main problem with English is of course when I must speak: I fell my self horrible without confidence, I think that always I'm thinking in Epanish and after makind the translation to English, may be in this moment when I'm writing this composition I'm making the same wrong. football is a fameous sport you can whatch it on tv or yo can see it on direct.there ara a lot of  level categories, the most fameous categorie is the first. Typically friends are grown from different environments and have different stories of life, this is more affecting factor for young adults who has to experience numerous things in limited time. To sum up, there were two reasons why friends influence most on young adults. Looking for any sport make you feel good and your brain be always refresh so that you  can begin your day with any sport to making fresh and after that you can make any job with refreshment mind."	2.5
298	"Government: Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.    "	"Various kinds of transporting facilities are helping our live: including facilities for a car, such as roads and highways, and a public transportation. Does why, is easy to believe that if things continue with this rhythm and transforming everything, in a closer future of 50 years everything is gonna be completely knew and different. I like going to the cinema, get out with my friends,  to playing the counter strike, walking to the park, going the shopping and can't stand watching the blood. Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath...deep one and started to dive . First of all, developing a public transportation reduces transport congestion. According to Kim, who researches about Korean transportation and transport congestion, using bus and underground reduces transport congestion more than 25%. We should consider the fact that the population density is exponentially increasing(Anderson), and capacitance of people in public transportation is much better than a car(Kim). Indeed, Following the researches about transportation and population, we can easily think that public transportation is better way in reducing transport congestion in high population density. Second, developing public transportation makes less destruction of environment. First,the bank notes are designed by consider,thinking from background colour,artwork,security issues.Then,the metal plates are preparated by skilled machinists.And then, the sheets are printed,operator should pay attention to the colour on both sides,special ink,and images slightly raised. Therefore, environment such as mountains are easily destroyed to construct highways and road. In contrast, developing public transportation usually happens inside or near the city, so it derives to less destruction of environment. In the present world television is very important.But sometimes it can also affect us in a negetive way..most people around the world can see any news in live.media is more help full for the people .television is also using as a study  material for example smart classes, online courses etc. But now I really enjoyed, and me best friend both for me ticket for a theatre to see the musical show ,which was amazing, for cuople of hours I didn't move, was a brilliant present. Public transportation uses less energy than a car, and also emits less pollution maters than a car. I am beleving that there is no future for the public transpot, using trains is mor convient and low expenses also to decrease the carpon gases which affecting the ozone, people should be aware about the effect of using the public transpotation on the econmics and enviroment, goverements shall encarge the people to use the other ways for transport, this subject shall be issuesd in all media to learn and encrage the people to use he wrigth way for transpot. To sum up, despite the convenience of a road and highways, we should develop a public transportation. Obesity and other thins about help, is a topic very important because the people is dying for this problem.For example, the form to prepare the food, is gonna be dangerous because a lot food have artificial thing that is no good for us. At the end, the government should invest in public transpotation. I strongly believe that grammar is not the most important element to speak English, if you know grammar you only know certain rules to write, but I think that speaking is most important than writing, because when you go to anyplace in the world, you have to be prepared to talk and understand whatever they say to you; in this part you may notice that if you don't know vocabulary, you wouldn't unsderstand anything; but here is another topic, whether you understand or not, you have to notice the way that people talk to you, and try to realize what the person is trying to say. Mohammed is a kindly prophet born in small city called mekka and travelled to another city closed to mekka called almadina cause the people of mekka were very aggressive and they not accepted the new Invitation for the new religio Mohammed came back to his town mekka after that and forgave the people of mekka whose abused him 29 Sep. 2012: A-22. If the  print sheets has good quality ,they will packing and distribution.some partially damaged  will cut into separate or packede or dispatched .The bad sheets will disposal ,the destroyed will be secure."	2.5
299	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you about the use of computers and how they are bad for society. I choose the wheel because is the most useful invention ever because thanks to it the human works make easier by example a way to move heavy objects, compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today the wheel was invented at a relatively late point of human history, he oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia. Almost everyone has a computer and it gets used more and more and it is just taking away a great time to go be active outside. so it become a fashion of using personal vehicle which create a lot of problem big one traffic problem..... now traffic problem is the biggest problem. There is so much talk these days how we are the fatest country. Well here is one of the main causes we have almost everyone stairing blankly into a computer screen instead of being active. In conclusin,the whole part of process is an unreversed schedule.It cosumemed the power which contained the humanity and machinic.Nevertheless,in my opinion the most precious of the revolution is the modern security measure through such a muti-developed society. show just look online you will find it. Secondly, studying in university, I have to live far from house which make me be homesick, sad, and worried I have to live in dormitory with many strange friends, they ‘re very noisy and I have to share my room with my roommates. The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years there are much less people outside. Then peter stared "" happy birthday my lovely sister"" peter said and gave here key of a car Sara was so amazed and hug here brother and grateful him . Lastly , workshops about conservation of environment to increase environmental awareness among people to encourage them to take care of their city , and how they can recycle some rubbish to beneficial objects to exploit it at home . To sum it up I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convinient.Public future unless they have project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger. The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots. Third, there are for less interactions personaly between well everyone. Kids that text, @CAPS2, or facebook chat more then talk in person with friends are loosing talking skills of actually having a conversation. Because online you have time to think then when you talk in person you have nothing to say because you can'@CAPS1 think and your not to your full talking potential. People are seeing eachother less and less now that they can text and talk over the computer they think now have no need to see eachother now and it is ok just to talk through the internet. In addition, stress is a clear disadvantage of compete because competitiors are trying to win and this can frustrates.But, some people do not think this like this and take it more simply Finally, I think that to compete in sports has some benefits and disadvantages, but when is controlated there are some benefits that help you to whole you life. Also, they say that you can learn more about someone in @NUM1 minutes of playing with them then in @NUM1 minutes of talking with them. With that being the case friends make friends now without even knowing that person with full understanding. Lastly, computers are doing more then good to everyone and they are becoming more and more unhealthy. With people getting less exercise, not enjoying nature as much and having less interactions people are just wasting their time infront of a computer screen getting fat rather then going outside with people and just passing a baseball. Today, we have more item to recycle as long as we clean properly and put in a proper bin, which will be use it by specialized factory in another item. Secondly, do more cooperation between countries.To illustrate, people should cooperation To intervene to bring peace to the world to stop the war in many areas like what United Nations doing.For example, United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy ."	2.5

And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"It seems today we attempt to censor everything, but are we going too far? Could it be that we have crossed the line and are no longer protecting the children, but are instead holding back our society as a whole? In my opinion, censorship of literature has crossed the line. A library is, essentially, an incredably valuable resource to each generation. In these diagrams below,the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly.The first step,the bank notes should be desinged concidering some constructions,like background color,artwork and security issues,After it was prepared,skilled machinists would make preparaation of metal plates in the second step.Then,sheets of bank notes would be printed by 50 bank notes per sheet,which have colour imagines on both sides in special ink.After printing well,these sheets would be manually inspected closely.It was the most important step during the whole processing.And then,some  sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets  which would be cut into and separated into equal ones andpacked and depatched to where they are demanded. We attempt to placate everyone in today's society, therefore we censor several things that are not politically correct. If future generations are unable to learn what we have through these writings, then they will lack the insight we had gained. Another reason is, to be perfectly honest, history and society have not- and very well @MONTH1 never truly be- politically correct. then when I have time and I see a senior citizen in the street  introducing their scraps bag in an wrong bank I explain them who they have to recycle and who important it is for our environment carefully recycle it After this is done, what have we really accomplished? my English   language is weak , I like to improve it which complete my post graduate study,      The reason for choosing this specifically English language  in September  future I would like to get to know more information about   an English language course . I advise any one dream to be one of the most famous teams that works on hisself a lot & and play football a lot to be profectional in this sport & show a lot of matches &followed by captain supervised on him We must learn about this because it was an important part in history that needs to be remembered in hopes that nothing so terrible as that will ever happen again. So, if we learn about an entire subject which happened in another country but effected the entire world should we not learn about our own faults in history? When printing finished,they should inspection.It the most important step.Printed sheets manually inspected.Finally,they  found good quality sheets and some partially damaged sheeets or bad sheets.They will packaging and distribution the sheets which is good in there.In that time they at fist cut into separate bank notes ,second they packed the sheets and diapatched. However the best option is that you came here and after I present my friends and their fathers because they can help with your job. After two years that his essay was released, he will understand that his essay was wrong moreover, Michael will want to apologise many people who read his essay thereby Michael now goes home, takes a cup of tea, goes to bed thus Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake you are responsible for your workers and the customer satisfaccion, However is very satisfying to see how your own company is grow up and your customers return again because they loved your job. In addition, A general vision on the human innovation show that the majority of people creations have bad effect, this effect exist even in people's lives or themselves. For if one person is aloud to say what is and isn't acceptable then others will partake in this as well. It would become a new fad and people would find a problem with just about anything. From the beginning of the world till now , human wants the fast income and the easy ways of live , so he tries more and more to find a solution for  his problems by creating a new ways of liveing more easy and more convenient  for him. We are forcing them to be ignorant of society's problems. In the end we must ask ourselves, was it really worth it? Nowadays public transportation is included almost all around the planet, We can admit that the transport revolution has been plave  in the last century but due to the globalization and technological development, the transport sector is always in a continuos transformation: In the other hand we must remarque how the plane sector has been grown, currently is the most common way of transport for going away and that's also means than the shipping factory has decreaced deeply, in order to let the plane market blomm."	2.5

"For other hand, People make other inventions for improving the world and reduce pollution, for example, In this time we have created electric cars or organic food, these things are very useful in future, because we will need to reduce pollution. You are in a world of endless possiblities. To each side of you lies a vast collection of diverse adventures and anecdotes. You are in a library where each book holds the key to a door of knowledge and adventure. Looking for an adventure of your own, you drift down each section searching for the one suitable to your liking. Turning the corner, your eyes suddenly glance over to some books and magazines with provocative and inappropriate pictures on them that are blatantly out in the open for anyone to gaze upon. This first reason is all actors shown their talent in this film directly and audience can follow their steps and the story certainly, this essential element which also makes a big success to the film. Sometimes the employers do strike and we clients do not known in time as a result we can not get on time to work,that is one of the disadvantages of using public transport. Firstly,hyrid cars only allowed to use during weekends as result of this most people not using there cars all the week. I believe that because libraries are used by everyone of all different ages, races, and genders, that some censorship should be put into effect. Some of the content found in libraries should be censored due to a diverse group of people in the world with different views, opinions, and morals. i like volei because it was part of my life and of life of my mother, is my favorite sport, but i like over sports too, same i don't play volei because I'm bad, and my friends that know, don't like of  peoples bad of volei.I'm watching they playing, they're really very good, but when play over school, they're very bad My name is Anna,I am a very cheerful person and I have a creative personality so I enjoy planning activities or organise sport events in a special and  colorful way.I really love childrens and take care of them ,I also had an experience  of working in summer camps and have a good experience doing delicious food because I already did this stuff in other camps.I think that I gave good reasons and I hope that you will accept me. I do @CAPS1 think that certain books should necessarily be removed from the shelf because of violation of rights to speech which includes written speech as well. I do, however, think that they should be sectioned off and clearly marked to warn unwanting eyes and ears of the material found there. Libraries are one of the number one resources when researching, reading, or gaining information and knowledge. I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens.So I do not agree with this afirmation, in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport. This includes children and families. Children do @CAPS1 need to be experiencing, learning about, or exposed to some of the content and material found in libraries. my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long. Children have rapidly developing minds and are sometimes defined by the images that they are exposed to. The creator of the haven and the earth, the creator of soles , the one who make earth rotate around it self and around the sun.What we belief as Muslims that, we have created by one who don't have other with him the one who create our father (Adam ) and created from him (Eve) and they were in the Paradise and instructed to not eat from the tree but the Satan deceive them so they brought to this life and generations came from them and had sent the prophet and messengers ( Moses, Jesus, Mohamed, others.. who they worship the same one) with Miracles and evidence of the truth, to guide the people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to the Paradise and who follow other paths which it will guide to the hell. When you have skill to read a book and in that  moment you are searching for good job you can find  a lot  jobs because you can develop easy when you compare with another person that they have been searched  job to Censorship, in regard to moving the books to a new location where a child can @CAPS1 stumble upon it, is the best choice. Another reason that I believe that the books should @CAPS1 be removed completely, but rather taken somewhere else in the library, is because that everyone has the right to express their opinions and feelings toward a subject. Because you are the best teacher in the whole world!many of our class classmate really like you too!We know that you are going to teach  Discovery-bay  primary school .My English result is  better once  you taught me I really love you, Ms Cumings!your friend Ms Decock told me that  she is going to Australia ,and I love you two both I hope you that you will come back some times ! The picture below illustrates how to make bank notes.First is to design the note,including background color,artwork and security issues.Second is to prepare mental plates as well as qulified machinists.Then is printing with special ink.When the one side is printed,raising the images slightly to make opposite to be colored.Last is the key step,inspection.It is of importance to inspect the printed sheets.If the sheet is good or partialy damaged,it can be packed and delivered by veichals after cutted in to separate notes.Otherwise ,the sheets and notes would be abandoned and destroyed in the fire. I think that if a person so desires such things and feels the need to read about them, then they have the right and the choice to do that. Although, people who do @CAPS1 want to see that should also have the choice to have that somewhere where they will @CAPS1 come across it. This is why the books should @CAPS1 be out in the open for all to see, but taken to a secluded section. In conclusion, the best solution when dealing with offensive material found in libraries is to @CAPS1 remove it completely, but section it off from everything else and allow exclusive access to only those who so desire such material. Everyone should have a choice and a right to see or @CAPS1 to see certain material they might find offensive. In doing so, the library, I believe, will become a better environment to all those who wish to access and use it. More people will use it and the library will then appeal to everyone."	2.5
302	"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"Laughter forms a bond between two people; a good laugh can turn an uncomfortable situation into a pleasant one. A fantastic example of the power of laughter would be the first time I met my mother's boyfriend. My father died when I was thirteen and since then I had stubbornly resented each new man my mother attempted to bring into my life. in my personal obinionits better to lern froma teacher not only dat you lern to pronounce the words correctly you also lern from a personwhat is in my opinion way better i thin k we spend enougth time on smart phones so i dont think its the best if we use them to lern as well. Firstly,the growing number of private cars cause the big problem with traffic jam .People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam.That wastes people's time and make people feel exhausted.Not mention to say,it's definitely hard to enjoy travelling in holidays.Secondly,private  cars are the main reason for the air pollution.We should consider the protection of environment for human future,not only care about the convenience we can see for now. My sisters and I were forced to scrub the house from top to bottom in order to prepare for our guest, while my mother cooked a giant pan of lasagna. When the house was clean and the dinner was cooked, I dressed for this most grievous occasion. I am also committed to preparing monthly reports for newspaper supplement “The Voice of Women” which issued by the WATC “Women's Affairs Technical Committee , and I have the cooperation with the Environment and Development the magazine which issued by Center for development work ""Maan"", annd other web sites and news and media organizations. At precisely six thirty in the @TIME2, @PERSON1's blue @ORGANIZATION2 pulled into our driveway. I shot my mother a steely eyed glare as I opened the door for the buffoon; thus, a most dreaded dinner began. Consider both aspects that can be concluded that government should respect the human right and set up a new department which use for people who want to apply to complete the military service. But in some country, You can use underground (metro) , it is very advanced than old types like Bus or Taxi,The underground is faster and clean and arranged . my favorite sport is swimming i swim 2 times per a week sometimes i go to the swimming pool in the same area which i work there and sometimes i go to the swimming pool of my cousin, i enjoy when i spend my time in the water and now even i am pregnant i am afraid when i swim with a group of people i keep telling them and screaming do not close with me ! My now giddy mother and her sullen children sat down to eat with the cheerful stranger. My younger sister warmed up to him first. She and @PERSON1 share a love of snakes, lizards and all things I deem ""creepy crawly."" A common interest brought them together before I knew it. We have Eather first than people thanour house.Eather is our home,we all have to protect it.But now people are distroy it.Just for mony for more house but if we destroy it we will all die our money will gone our house will gone we will have nothing.Beside some people destroy farland to build houses but if one day there is no farmland than what should we eat?Nothing at that time we can eat nothing!So what should we do? @PERSON1 and my sister discovered they were both @CAPS1 fans, and consequently formed a bond over their team. After winning my siblings over, @PERSON1 tried to charm me into liking him to. He attempted to talk of movies, music, sports, animals, even politics, but nut nothing he said could melt my icy disposition. I was determined to hate him from the start of the @TIME2, and no amount of charisma would break my persistent stubbornness. pain and gain  This movie is bases quote on quote on a ""true story"" buts obviously director michael bay know for the transformers franchise puts a lot of hollywood into this movie, its about a bodybuilder named daniel lugo who decides to kidnap a rich guy and make him sign away all of his properties, which obviously its not a great plan that backfires on him, and eventualy police get him. Over dessert he jumped into a stand-up comedy routine cleverly disguised as a story about his recent flight to @LOCATION1. He went on about the ridiculous security checks, the overly cheerful flight attendants who really hate their job, and the corny safety videos. It was a cold day at night when I was at home watching my favourite programme on my telly called ""dare to win"", I was with my brother, when we decided to call, The programme is about questions for the contestants that must be answer in correct time, and there is a different things for the winner. I fought hard to resume my former demeanor, but my will did not stand a chance against @ORGANIZATION1's sense of humor. Suddenly we heard the sound of running footsteps.Then there was a cry and the footsteps stopped.Nervously,we walked back.Perhaps someone had been killed,or kidnapped in the street We were going to see what happened ,and we had something to see.There was one old granny who was beat up.We try to gave her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that.Than we were trying to find help ,but nobody was opening doors.On our luck I had a mobile phone ,but Michael was saying that we need to escape because we did not know are those bullies near the corner.My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I've done that. Sure enough, we were the best of friends before the night ended. But lot of peoples saying that, the zoo can protected endagered spices against illegal poachers. They simply fueled the fire.

Just as the shortest distance between to points is a straight line, laughter was the straight line between myself and @PERSON1. It gives the students the freedom to choose his major and the teachers.In addition, it has a lot of facilities that serve students like kindergarten that takes care of children these employees, university housing, hospital the student of medicine can be application in it and it serves the people too, and a big library has many books in various languages."	2.5

We either find our @CAPS2 in the house or encounter them tromping out of the woods to meet us, shovels, chainsaws and other trailbuilding implements in their hands. Does why, is easy to believe that if things continue with this rhythm and transforming everything, in a closer future of 50 years everything is gonna be completely knew and different. During the hottest part of the @CAPS4, we head for the shade of the lush @ORGANIZATION1 woods. A short walk will bring us to a trail. I love walking among the sun-streaked ferns and fallen logs, treading carefully the rickety bridges over burbling streams, bouncing confidently on the sturdy new bridges, and trying to avoid the dogs as they galumph in and out of the water. @PERSON2 knows all about the flora and fauna of the region, so we get a constant stream of knowledge as we hike. People who reach 18 have to complete military service is an issue, the supporters suggest that is helpful for the 18 to train the physical fitness and psychological quality, whilst opponents point out that is harmful for the human right and affect development of the country. I choose the wheel because is the most useful invention ever because thanks to it the human works make easier by example a way to move heavy objects, compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today the wheel was invented at a relatively late point of human history, he oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia. and a douglas fir over there (not as well.

One of the best parts of the hike is when we see the dead-end section of trail that my family helped construct three years ago. Good day, My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport, Volleyball one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to practise  this sport 3 times a week since 1980,  the reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as follows : 1- make me fit and healthy  2- classy game no friction between players  3- it exercise all muscles of your body Regarding the above I advice all rookies to start practise this sport and they will get many benefits. could you really bike up a trail like that? After our walk, we arrive back at the house, sweaty and talkative. To sum it up I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convinient.Public future unless they have project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger. They recently built a dock that we can jump off of -- a great improvement over wading in from the edge. he said kindly:""I buy you a present,open it,Tom"" Tom opened the big bag,Oh!This is a big surprise,there was a football in it,which he always wanted to buy there were some words goal!keep doing! Finally we get tired and sit by the side of the pond, drying off in the warm sun. By @TIME1, dinner is ready. Laura usually makes salmon, accompanied by a plethora of delicious side dishes. In order to reuse, I convert all thing reusable,for example,plastic bottle as a plant pot; glass bottle as a food container;I bring my reusable shopping bag and refuse to use a shopping plastic if a salemen offer me to bring. For all the people I advise to start to play or watching football because for me it is a very good sport , but you can play a good football only if you really like it , because first football is fun . After the meal, we haul chairs and dishes back to the house and sit on the porch into the @TIME2.

Yes,I think it also can educate.As times go by,technology is rapidly improving.More and more gadgets are invented such as televisions,smartphones and so on.There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly.Using will not only gain the entertainment but also get the knowledge.For instance,there are numerous program that we can choose.It is a good time to turn to the entertaining program,when we feel bored and gaze the wall all the day.Television provides educated varieties of channels as well.Discovery channel is posture-oriented model example to educate.We can learn how do the different animals feed on themselves.Above the statements can ensure a rich and abundant live. A few minutes ago,some boy who looks  like elderly than my old brother closed to the poor little boy,the little boy stopped cried,he looked on some boy,my brother felt afraid because they look like rube,but he still  wanted help the little boy. The best thing about these days is the friendship and comradery we have with this wonderful family. The parents knew each other long before us kids were born, so we have a lot to talk about; @PERSON2 is very interested in science topics, and he always finds a way to bring up the latest article he read. And, as with all great @CAPS2, we laugh constantly. I consistently get hiccups at least three times just when we're lounging on the porch after our busy @CAPS4. Even on the most serious topics, my dad or the @PERSON1 boys can find a joke to make, usually ""politically incorrect"" but always very funny.

"I studied in Kuwait schools , after that I joined Damascus university , the faculty of human medicine , I graduated from it in 2008 with very good grade , then I got the Master's degree in laboratory medicine from the same university (Ministry of Higher Education ) in 2013 with Excellent grade . In my opinion, Family is the place that had you best friend can help each other and know each.In the Taiwan,many of people have to take care of them parent when they get old,but the point is what if you can not survival,I mean you don't have enough money to raise you parent.Back to the topic,I don't know well any of member of in my family,I don't trust them,honestly. However, we can also find advantages when we take online courses because of three reasons. first my favorite sport is futboll and i like for many reasons for example while you are watching a match you´re going to feel exited and entretaining besides that fubol has the best fotboll player than ever who is leo mesy he's the best and he s able to awesome stuff when he´s playing. The most important step is inspect the notes which are good quality sheets and which are bad sheets.If the sheets are good,those sheets are then cut into separately and packed into cars in order to dispatach all over the city.If the sheets are bad,those sheets are then destroyed through burning. We can also use time flexibly. They die when John was too little to remember and he never know what happened so he went to all the parts for saw them even he walked and walked even at reverse but he never found them. If we should take class in the college, we should prepare books that need in the class. Nowadays in the cities developed there are many possibilities for public transport, like bus, train, subway, tram etc.these options it's more economical than the car, the problem of the car is that normally the car is occupied for a person, when the car is prepared for to carry four or five people. In my case, when I was eighteen, I forgot files that need in the class and this fault made my class' quality bad to me because I do not have files to understand teacher's lecture. I agree that communiting by car is easier and faster than most of the public transportation; however, there are serious problems come after it; the amount of vehicles on the roads keep increase and make congestion and pollution which are far more severe than the inconvenience causing by public transportation. If we do not have books beside us, we can find our shelves. Secondly, we can save our time. he jump from his bed to the street and walk to his way to see what he did every morning.when he walk after the stranger man  he notice that he stopped in every trash in the street to take a look and go to the next one, and guess what he saw Michael and run away also Michael was afraid. Even though there are rooms for students in the college, It takes times to go to classroom. And there are distance between classroom to other classroom. my English   language is weak , I like to improve it which complete my post graduate study,      The reason for choosing this specifically English language  in September  future I would like to get to know more information about   an English language course . However, when we use online lecture, we do not have to think about times about moving to classrooms. We just click zoom address and take the class. Furthermore, students and professors can use time more flexible. For example, there are classes using both video in KLMS and zoom. Professors can record videos when they want, and students can watch videos when they want. I do currently master but I can devote myself to the Fellowship Especially since I finished the Pre-Masters and now I need only follow-up from time to time with my guide Academic, so I have the time for the Fellowship . As we can know about this example, we can use time flexibly. This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. there was also a cup in it,It said""don't give up your dream,keep doing!go!we stand by you!come on""  Tom love it ,""thanks mom,thanks dad!"	2.5

If @CAPS1 is unaware, problems can only be helped to a short extent. There is a point in which words can turn into harrassment, but the boundaries before reaching that point can be fairly defended by the freedom of speech. @CAPS1 must learn in order to teach. @CAPS1 must teach for others to learn. one of the most amazing parts of the film is when Teresa calls Cruel for go for them and take them again to the Cruel building and like all of them doesn't wanna go with them they start a war and they take Mihno with them and at the end Thomas decide to go after them and he give a super great speech for all the persons go with them and help him to get back Mihno, and what i really want to see in the next film is that if Thomas is mad at Teresa( i never like her) and if they get free and the world comes back to the normal world. Moreover also simple things are changed, for example the food we eat: some times ago everythingh was natural, healthy... but now everyone eat always ""junk food"" and thinghs like that, which are completely unhealthy !

It @MONTH1 not be completely accurate. The passing of the information from historian to historian over the centuries can potentially be described as the game telephone. cars are faster than public transport so cars are more convenient than public transport it is easier ,faster and more comfortable especially in long distances so governments should improve public transport as not all people have cars Third, this is the most important step that printed sheets manually inspected,the this sheets are classified three areas.The number one called good quality sheets,they will be packed and dispatched.The next called partially damaged shees,and bank notes separaed into good and bad, good sheets will be cutted into separate bank notes and packed,the bad one will be destroyed by fair.The number three called bad sheets ,they will be securely destroyed. It can help @CAPS1 to learn from mistakes and solve problems. The world cannot afford to censor. Censorship does not change the existence of that censored author's thoughts or the reality of what has occurred. The best season to sale the ice cream from the van is autumn,while that is one of the worst season for indoor swimming pool.The discrepancy of these two place is large.The best sale achievement of the van is 4500,5000,5500respectively. As this essay is being read, people are dying. It can easily be counted: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3. They are gone. However, I have no agree with this statement because the public transport is needed for someone who are no have vehicle or economic downturn. I have to say that study another language give you more opportunities  because on these days you need to now other language to look for a work and be more inteligent than your college to take the work and that’s great. We need knowledge to make the most out of it. Frist of all at home we recycle plastics, glasses, papers and cartons, oils, clothes, batteries, organics in an especial composting bank where we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials and finally all the other things are sends to an especial tip where we avoid to drop it anywhere. If @CAPS1 were to refrain from listening when being spoken to, it would be disrespectful and offensive to the speaker. A lot of the people in underdeveloped countries go with their starving cries unheard. Such cries make the more fortunate, well-fed, and housed people such as myself uncomfortable. Her mom die because some things or someone drag her of the leg and drop it in a cave were other animals eat her. sukh was so angry with him because he heart her a lot, sukh refuse to give her laptop and her brother start again fighting with her and even he slapped her sister. The people of my town try to plant plants in the centre or somewhere is too smoke, so they try to keep the air at recommended levels.on the morning a lot of people go on footto the work or to the school or ride a bike or they take the bus.The people try to move the local factories out of country where is less air polluted ,less smoke,less cars and more forests and plants. Every single person has the right to be heard. The people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others. There is no absolute, divine being that can accurately judge a material. The people that censor could be wrong about the content of the material. i think that this is the guestion for every one, and the answer can't be one for all, cause, someone can use public transport, and economy by this not only money, but and the environment, but some people don't like to use p.t., cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple don't like to travell with another people. Censorship should not be allowed because time and knowledge are the valuable building blocks that determine the future of humanity and not a single thought should go unheard. Censorship is a great hindrance to knowing what is occurring and what has occurred in the world. On the top of the steps is the inspectation by hands, that is to say, they should be separated into well-qualified ones,which are to be cut into bank notes,and delivered to the banks and the bad ones which can't be utilited are fired definitely at the last stage. It is up to the world to unleash it and make something out of it."	2.5
306	"Government: Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.    "	"The diabetes is the increasing  of the glucosa in the blood, The have two types, first the Diabetes Type 1 that is predent in childrens, pacient needs insuline every day, also this diabetes is caused by the destruction of the insuline realized by the person´s immuny siste. Also, most of people use public transportation everyday. Some people feel that the roads and highways should be improved; however, others feel that there should be more public transportation. First of all,friends are important for us,we want a friend that we can share our secrets and problems.But friends maybe in the future go away or hurt you!So you can't always based on them!For example,they need you until they find someone better than you and in the end they go away.But family never let you go or family never go away from you! There are several reasons why road development is a priority. First of all, there are many roads which have to be improved. For example, at the country, some roads are too narrow that two cars can barely pass by. In addition, some roads are too bumpy; therefore, they can damage to cars. Also, some highways are old and damaged. They need to be check and repaired to prevent accidents. In addition to some old roads, some other roads are difficult to pass due to heavy traffic. One day many years ago in something place that a don't remember the name I woke up one morning more earlier than usual then I went to the kitchen and shout the name of my mother...but no one answered, and the first thing that I imagine is that they come to the town, quickly I went out to find they... But there was no one, absolutely no one, I'm scary, I yell and scream, look and look but I had no result  Suddenly I felt a warm hand that touched my shoulder and very slowly turn but the only thing I saw was a shadow that was holding a knife     I woke up and realised it had all been a bad dream If the roads are expanded or new roads are built, this problem will be solved. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately.He had to buy a present for his girlfriend´s birthday but it was Sunday and all stores were closed so he had to found a solution.A few hours,he was walking by a garden,and suddenly,he saw the most beautiful flowers that he has ever seen,so he picked them up.However,flowers weren´t enough so he decided to think in anything else.Several hours later,he found an open sweet shop and he bought some bonbons for her.Finally,he had found the present and before the end of the day he ran quickly to his girlfriend's house.If you don't want to pass this situation,you must always do things with time. Since many people drive to their hometowns, highways should be more developed. Tottaly l think changing is ignorable but we can control it to make our life better,specially about food that is most important aspect of ourlife but we don't pay attention to it enough. That is true, but the roads should be ready before that. I know that I am a suitable person for this job, and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job, because I have been travelled for all the world and in this experience, I have seen in the necesity on work to fiance my journey, so the I have dedicated to work on summer camps, and I have a lot of experience in this. Also, some people do not use public transportation, but there is no one who does not use the roads; therefore, the development of roads should be prioritized. my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long. To sum up, the government should pay more attention to the development of roads and highways. For this reason, the first is that many roads are now old and require maintenance, and secondly, some roads are complicated. The development of roads is very necessary for people to pass more comfortably and smoothly."	2.5
307	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"Hey my name is Joe and i´m 21 years old and i´l think i´l would compliment the summer camp very good, because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak. No all is good some people haven't got money can't go to another place to another place and the pollution became more and more, it is a serious problem and the solution is only for the rich people, the solution is buy an electric car, the other solution, more economic, is the government give the money to the population to buy an electric car. First, some people might insist that high-payed will enhance the quality of the time spending with family and friends, but I argue that the lack of conversation between them will make the moment feel worse. Since they had a short time to spend together because of the job condition, they do not have any recent information about each other, so continuing the conversation full of joy will be harder than the others. At the end, the kind of live that we will see in fifty years from now will have a lot of stuff to help the people to have a more comfortable, easier and faster way of live, but this will be only to meke more money and consume more and more, also the things will be faster of waste to make the people to change their apparel more often and create a consumerism. Despite the fact that money makes the future life happier, we have to think about what makes us happy right now. Alison felt desesparate, she notice that her husband´s car were in her house, so he was walking or someone pick up to him, she takes the phone and she call all him group of friends, nobody now anything and now they were scaried. According to this fact, spending much time regardless of what they do together, will make us feel loved and gives us time to recognize who we are. First of all,tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world.Alongside with its development,the ablity of travalling has easened to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another.The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism,as well as with the idea of globalisation,since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen. Nonetheless, some people still cling to the mistaken notion that spending a short time with their family and friends makes them feel energized, however, having shorter hours after a long time of work will make the worker more stressed. I reduce use of innecesary power at home, in other words,I turn on light that I need for the while i use it;I take less warm shower; I hit only neccesary rooms. In addition, the given little time with family and friends will steel the time for the worker to have extra time for themselves to do their hobbies such as sports or playing instruments. I decided and went.It was strange because I never went to the sports.From the time I started going to karate.After one month my instructor told me that I will go to the competition.I was very worrying and nervous. However, while some people consist that choosing a high-paying job with long hours that would give them little time with family and friends is more beneficial, I believe that it is much worse. Even though they get paid a lot more, working for long hours will make the connection between their family and friends weaker and lose themselves full of stress. Consequently, I insist that working at a place where I get lower-payed with more time with family and friends is a better choice."	2.5
308	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Ideally, I completely agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Through this, there will be many advantages that will benefit most of society. Banning smoking in restaurants would encourage more smokers to cut their smoking habits since they would have a hard time finding a place to take a puff. Additionally, the ban of smoking will encourage a more healthy environment in restaurants since they will not be any second-hand smoked inhaled by customers. When he was just about cursing the final line he got hurt and his mussels was dying and star to peel off a black matter, at that point the guys in suit thought that he won’t be able to cross the line , but when they saw that he kept running, they freeze the time and run after him, he stopped for a moment but then , he start running again and when he cross the line he woke up in a red somber fluid, he was wiped out from the matrix, he opened his eyes and saw a flying robot, suddenly he was on a wood wheelchair and they said that he would never be able to walk again , besides that, he stands up and tried to walk again. However, I feel that it is impractical for smoking to be banned at all the restaurants. One day I visit my friend Jimmy in New York city, he was a young man who was specialist on trains and tourism, he talked about how the citizens and the commuters move from one place to another, he told me that the grand central terminal was the largest terminal of the city,he show me were the landmarks of the big apple were so sightseers could go,he show me the city and we went to different parts first he took me to Columbus circle in the south west corner of central park were there were the most expensive apartments then we went to the lake were the jogging tracks that circle the lake area popular with early morning visitors,then we went to the museum of natural history that was located near the metropolitan museum of art then I got focal on the subway trains so we went to Grand central terminal when we arrive I was amazed to see many people going to work so he told me that it was conveniently for people to use the train because is very fastest and for the government it was a grat economic business then he told me that one of the characteristics of Then ,the notes will be prepared with metal plates .After that ,printing ,the notes will be printred in colour on  both sides with special ink and it will images sightly raised . my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long.

309	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers have a coolest effect on people. It allows people to develop hand-eye coordination, allow people to learn about faraway people and cultures, and communicate online through e-mail or instant messaging. Firstly it is clear that more house and transport networks is convenient for our people,what is knowed to us is that the population growth is a big problems,which is needed for more palce to living.And builing more transport networks is also benifit for us,for example ,the high-speed rail can be shorteded our time in traveling.while the animal may not welcome to it, I used to live for a short time in a place where word recycle was completely ignored but they used to this because that wasn't so rich. Hand-eye coordination is a and in life.

You can in with a friend that is out of state, or you can talk with a person out of this country! Many people do this in their spare time to try and set up a reunion with people that you know in middle school through college. Tons of these people have not seen were @NUM1.

310	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"In my opinion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Singapore. Summer holiday, I have been to Italy on holiday 3 years ago.I didn't have a long holiday ,it was just for 3 days but these 3 days were the best in my life.I must say that I went there because my sister is living there so I didn't have to book a room at the hotel and spending too much money.I went to the Vatican and Rome,I saw their massive buildings which were impressive and their old houses.The weather was fantastic ,I love bathing in the sun and resting on the hot sand on the beach. My favorite sport is swimming.I engaged in swimming in nine years old.I had gotten first prize in a match.As a result,I think that I have some intellent on swimming.Since then,I meet my teacher in the pool.She teach me a lot of things,and be the most important figure in my life.She is a doctor,she told me that swimming will let my body more better.From then on,I fell my disease in decreasind and fell relax.Consequently,I need to swim usually. Banning smoking also allows all diners to eat in peace, such that their appetites are not ruined from inhaling poisonous smoke when they are eating at the same time. In my view I think that smoking is not a bad thing itself, if smokers know the risk to their health and they choose to do it. you are responsible for your workers and the customer satisfaccion, However is very satisfying to see how your own company is grow up and your customers return again because they loved your job. Therefore, by banning smoking, the law will actually help to protect his family members from health risks. In conclusion, I feel that smoking should be banned, simply because it is reasonable to not want to inhale second hand smoke, and as a non-smoker, we should have the right and privilege to not inhale smoke. I reduce use of innecesary power at home, in other words,I turn on light that I need for the while i use it;I take less warm shower; I hit only neccesary rooms."	2.5

"Suddenly,a rube boy grabbed the little boy 's clothes,the little boy was cried loudly,my brother was outrege,ran to the rube boy and attached  him. If we do that, then all the books would be off the shelf. Sometimes the really good books are when they are offensive, because they are actually telling you what they really believe in. I remember when I was twelve, the news was saying that a school was taking books off the shelf because it offended one person in the school. The shocking part was that almost the whole school was reading that book.

Secondly, do more cooperation between countries.To illustrate, people should cooperation To intervene to bring peace to the world to stop the war in many areas like what United Nations doing.For example, United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy . However,the family is near you since the day you were born until forever.The members follow you,and can based on them.You can tell whatever you want to them.For example,if you are in a bad mood the first person that will come next to you,to make you smile is your mom or dad.Mom and dad spent their life to grow up their children,to feed them,to love them! They can express their feelings in a way that is amazing. Dear Sir or Madam Reference to your advertisement I would like to apply for the position to work in AMERICAN SUMMER CAMPS,I am John from  the capital city of south state in India, I worked in middle aged  school for about 2 years, where I had experience which will be suitable for the current position. People are alwasy listening to music. When they are sad, mad, upset, confused, etc. it's for this reason that I think the public transport is a great benefit for the society, and a good way for move us of the one place at other,  I suggest that  the government  has to give more means for the purpose of improving the public transport. Movies are going to be offensive to at least one thing all the time. That is what makes a movie: a hero and a vilian. We want to good guys to win. all my class called me creep ugly geek but still little good only when a teacher want from them a research or the exams are next couple days but Michael trying to stop me doing that because they never become my friends and i was bigger to do this things ;    that day i just finish help younger student to understand his  math lesson  My friend Michael asked me to do the same to give her answer sheet for all final exams i was in bi shook why she  want that from me  any way i collect my courage told her that was wrong and become to do that in college better to start study  now and I'll help her to study the hard lessons (i was very sad to say no & she asked me that)she become very angry and told me i should help her because we she was my best Friend then i told her that why i told her NO and she told me i hate you Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Somebody is always going to get hurt. When I read, watch, or listen to something, I do not think of how offensive it is to me or somebody else. after two days poleas sow some boody in crime scene the poles man ask them what did you do hear ? Why they wrote it that certain way. If I am listening to music, I listen to the beat and the words at first. one of the most amazing parts of the film is when Teresa calls Cruel for go for them and take them again to the Cruel building and like all of them doesn't wanna go with them they start a war and they take Mihno with them and at the end Thomas decide to go after them and he give a super great speech for all the persons go with them and help him to get back Mihno, and what i really want to see in the next film is that if Thomas is mad at Teresa( i never like her) and if they get free and the world comes back to the normal world. If I do not like it, then I just change the song. I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked.Pleasure to work at concerts is when  I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate.The experience  is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert. We need the different opinions in life. If we all had the same opinions, we would not be ourselves in anyway. We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben, which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye.To got to the Big Ben we took the underground, but to get to the London Eye a red bus.After 3 days we went home.I forgot to tell you something about homeless people.A lot of people are homeless, which is sad, but maybe we can change it. Technology advance way to fast and it is really difficult guessing what kind of stuff or artefacts will be fifty years from now, but we can guess some ideas like flying cars, smartphones with the size of a small paper, laptops really thin like quarter of inch, clothes that clean itself or change the color and shape, healthier food, smarter electrodomestics. I strongly believe that grammar is not the most important element to speak English, if you know grammar you only know certain rules to write, but I think that speaking is most important than writing, because when you go to anyplace in the world, you have to be prepared to talk and understand whatever they say to you; in this part you may notice that if you don't know vocabulary, you wouldn't unsderstand anything; but here is another topic, whether you understand or not, you have to notice the way that people talk to you, and try to realize what the person is trying to say. But I am true to myself. And I respect other people's opinions. I wish everyone would do the same. Or at least try to do the same. This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake."	2.5

"Losing @CAPS1 to @ORGANIZATION1 are a huge part of daily life these days, which is good for businesses, and schools but for people just looking to pass time, computers are a dangerous choice. Yes, computers are a way of communication, and are helpful if a student forgets their homework or an assignment, but when it comes to boredome computers are bad. Social networking is scary in reality and too many young people are exposing themselves in making @CAPS2 or a @CAPS3 page. Firstly,hyrid cars only allowed to use during weekends as result of this most people not using there cars all the week. for example,using wind Energy or Solar Energy for electricity generation we will be used less fuel what is affected in emissions. the movie I´m going to be reviewing is ""the purge""  I actually loved it quite a lot, I just loved all the suspense and the parts they leave you hanging, it´s just way too interesting, the movie is about the american government who annually gives 12 hours where all crime, even murder, is legal, and there are no medical services during that long period of what they call ""the purge"" and anyone can join it, you can kill whoever you want. Computers like anything else, are fine in moderation, but too much of one thing just isn't healthy. Websites like @CAPS2, or @CAPS3, or @CAPS6, are scary when it comes to privacy. People who reach 18 have to complete military service is an issue, the supporters suggest that is helpful for the 18 to train the physical fitness and psychological quality, whilst opponents point out that is harmful for the human right and affect development of the country. Also these w ebsites are addicting. You @MONTH1 just want to log on to check your notifications but you can end up on the computer for @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours without even realizing it. Micheal was afraid he was waiting for sara to get out he went to the shore to look if she went from the other side but he found no footprints.his mother called him he went home and still thinking about sarah.it was night and ge was afraid ti get there again.he went to sleep .michael closed the door and knew at this moment he had made a mistake. All you can get from an hour on the computer is blurred vision. It would be okay to be on the computer for 1/@NUM1 hour a day but not using to the internet. Websites can be a way to find computer time. Tom friend of Peter suddenly fainted fell down in the class room I don't know what to do immediately, first calm down yourself and I checked his pulse beat it is okay,then I knew that he is out of danger so I called my classmates everyone rushing to the spot but still he is not moving so we decide to take him into the hospital or call the ambulance, finally we  call the ambulance without ant delay. Google is helpful for research or vocab work. When websites like these are the focus on computer time, it is much more productive. Overall, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people if as many people that use computers balanced that time with time to excersise, they would all be better off."	2.5
313	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"Nowadays, there's a growing trend for college students to have a part-time job, such as tutors, waitress, teacher assistants, etc. Some people think it is good for students to have some practical experiences through a part-time job, while others argue it's purely waste of time. However, the question whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job is quite controversial, at least to me. That means he is a careless, who always drives too fast  But public transport has advantages: If we uses it is the essential transport to travel. many countries are truly started to concern no environment and worried about the globe warming ,In schools teachers are doing their best  to educate children how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy,also they train them how to plant trees in public gardens of their towns ,Although  government strict so many laws and taxes in the people how do not pay their taxes to the council for cleaning of the rubbish from towns and villages,in the biggest polluted city in the world people started to use bicycles and cycling instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city,also they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive. I had a terrible experience in this Chinese New Year!Because Norovirus infected me!At first,I had a high fever but I thought if I take some medicine I will be fine.Therefore,my condition took a sharp turn for the worse.I cannot eat anything even in New Year's Eve and I was so tired that I cannot play poker with my cousins.Though everythings were depressing,I still have a wonderful winner vacation with my family:we went to  Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village(九族)to visited its blooming cherry blossom. Besides, a part-time job can be a stimulus for students to study harder. We can not stop changing but we can guide it to the a special  benefit which it makes the life easier and more comfortable.Using the changing method would improve the education system in many aspects especially for people with obstruction. Thus, in order to have a better career after graduation, he may have a solitude goal to his study and achieve greater progress. Moreover, students who have a part-time job may become independent earlier than those who don't, for they may obtain a clear view of money through earning it by their own. Maintaing cars are expensive.Public transport you do not need to worry about any petrol filling, checking tyre pressures, getting tired after driving long journey.In future cutting down public transport affects many of the people.Elderly people wont able to drive always depends on public transport.If public transport stop services people who are not able to drive will  affect a lot. Having a part-time job may occupy too much time, which leaves little for one to do his study. Instead of acting as a stimulus, in this case the part-time job becomes a obstacle. Such cases should be taken into consideration since it happens all the time when there's a big project in the work for you to conduct. When alison knock on his parents door she noticed that there were many people in her parents house, a man open the front door.When she entered  the house ,a man was looking at her with a bad face,when suddenly this man shot with a gun to Alison father. After two years that his essay was released, he will understand that his essay was wrong moreover, Michael will want to apologise many people who read his essay thereby Michael now goes home, takes a cup of tea, goes to bed thus Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake There's no easy way to answer the question"	2.5
314	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Requiring students to Specialize in One subject in universities is the Best for All
     Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects: other universities require students to specialize in one subject. People are debating about this statement, and this is hot issue now. I insist that universities should require students to specialize in one subject. First at all, universities are facilities to teach students in advanced level of the subject. Students learn diverse subjects in course of secondary schools, and they enter to university having purpose to learn specialized subject more deeply. Another ones which were bad sheets and bad bank notes from damaged apparently,would be destroyed securely.This was the whole working process of the bank notes and it was consist of 7 steps. In addition, it is more easy to call better professors when universities require students to specialize in one subject. As universities that require students to specialize in one subject have the obvious vision, superior professors will attracted in this point. Also, as stand out professors are in the these universities, the more eminent professors will come, which will give positive feedback on the universities. There was a island that each year in some moth come a hurricane this island is located  in a equator then the people went to this island currently but they can´t went when the hurricane is there because they can dead in the hurricane. I don't think there is no future for public transport.Especially in urban, for example, Taipei city in Taiwan.People who lives there almost know the convenient public transport called MRT, it's fast, cheaper and doesn't have to find the parking lot. Students can studty about these subject by searching internet or make a club of studying those subjects and this is not the region that universities should do. To sum up, universities should require students to specialize in one subject for students, professors, and for university itself. It is very difficult to deny the importance of family in our life,  definitely families play an essential role community structure .According to the experts we can't create  successful society without creative families , and one another specific part of your life is a good partners surrounding your daily activities. For these reasons, I insist that universities should require students to specialize in one subject."	2.5

Ever since we were little, our young minds have been filled with opinions of others from history and from the present. Whether we are reading a book, watching a motion picture, or even listening to a new music artist, our lives are being affected by such media. The art world is considered to be one of the most controversal businesses to work in. Adolescent has always been the hardest part throughout anybody's whole life.. turning out in a fleeting glimpse into an adult, perceiving the other side of life,how tough and complicated it is, trying to deal with its different circumstances.. at this point you merely have a brief look at your whole life, many questions spinning in your head, accusing yourself of being a lost cause, wishing if you could turn the clock back,,but it's all no good.. then you find yourself standing ahead clouds of reality, which sucks.. life is stages, this stage of your life is timeless, no way out.. at some point you wish if it was all illusio, you need a time machine makes it possible to go back in time when you could see the purity of life.. However..here you are completely different made of life lessons, preferring to make a stiff upper lip..cowering in your own reality. We all are given the right to our opinion on such  pieces. Travelling by car is convenient but there are dis advantage as well.As our population growing fast in a family both husband and wife working and children at university able to drive, so you are looking per house least 3 cars, so imagine how busy our roads will be.As now fuel price coming down that does not mean that it will stay like that for ever, price go up and down. Them they drink a cafe that give them many energy to construct faster the building, this café has a combination for the people can to live all the night. Environmental changes really need in the current situation.People contribuation is very important in this matter.The report explains how my town people taking care of my surroundings and to preserve this planet in a betterway. I agree that communiting by car is easier and faster than most of the public transportation; however, there are serious problems come after it; the amount of vehicles on the roads keep increase and make congestion and pollution which are far more severe than the inconvenience causing by public transportation. Since we live in such a diverse community of religions, these pieces will never satisfy the audience. Then ,the notes will be prepared with metal plates .After that ,printing ,the notes will be printred in colour on  both sides with special ink and it will images sightly raised . In the end,if it is a good sheet,the porcedure is packaging and distribution,including cutting into separate bank notes,packing,dispatching.If it is a bad sheet,the porcedure is disposal    --bad sheetsand bank notes should be securely destroyed. No piece of media can possibly be directed to satisfy the opinions of all the world. As a personal example, I can see that novels and books over war are heavily criticized. The men and women who fought for our country @MONTH1 enjoy to see such pieces written about them, but war protesters and peace keepers @MONTH1 see this as an insult to their cause. So I do not have opptunity to practical English Because most of my colleagues speak French.They speak French in the meeting, in the gearm, and in the shopping This book was heavily criticized over the topic of censorship. The world in which they lived in had dramatically been affected by the impact of peoples opinions. If a book or movie was offensive to a group of people, then they burned the books. History books about slavery and war were burned because others found the topics offending. Non-religious groups thought that religion was offensive, so they burned the @CAPS2 and other works of religion. I love to listen to British English, but it’s really hard to study, all because we are all learning American English in Taiwan, so when I have the opportunity to contact British English, it’s full of tone cadence, always feel particularly charming, and British culture exudes noble temperament, so British accent sounds like there is always an indescribable elegance qualities. @PERSON1 denies the book was written over censorship but his book gives our generation a great lesson. For generations, we have grown up in a world of diversity. Every mind is special and different and will never share identical thoughts as his neighbor. To sum it up I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convinient.Public future unless they have project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger. Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real. Egypt have more historical places such as pyramids is the one of empirical in the world and more people from around the wold come to see this pyramids the wold think how Egyptian people make this building from may be thousand year and still stand without change and more tourist come to take photo in the pyramids and study the stone and how the old Egyptian make this one without modern tools such as cranes and other modern machine more scientific teams come from all the world to study this building and make Egyptian science in more universities around the world to study how the air going inside this building and how it keep the food inside it and how this big stone takes out from far places and come for this place and how this building keep the body of the people after died and how this people leave inside the building and why this building like this and what the benefit of this building and how to make kike this building We need to accept our neighbor and his opinions because we are all born equal.

"Nowadays we use technology in every thing, from educations to making clothes, we use technology everyday and everywhere.Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful,useful and  important for development but todays generation is influenced whit technology that they have stopped to do other activities. Including children's books, novels for young adults, @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON2, music, and movies, the library gives us a magnitude of opportunities to discover something we didn't know before. Although, there are other things that can be found in the library as well. Books including racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments can accidentally be stumbled upon while searching for something else. A parent should not have to worry about their child coming across a book or magazine containing inappropriate things such as this. I believe that offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of our libraries. In case of transportation technology, in this twenty first century we have various option like Plan that can fly with the cloud, train that fast and big enough that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time. pain and gain  This movie is bases quote on quote on a ""true story"" buts obviously director michael bay know for the transformers franchise puts a lot of hollywood into this movie, its about a bodybuilder named daniel lugo who decides to kidnap a rich guy and make him sign away all of his properties, which obviously its not a great plan that backfires on him, and eventualy police get him. first my favorite sport is futboll and i like for many reasons for example while you are watching a match you´re going to feel exited and entretaining besides that fubol has the best fotboll player than ever who is leo mesy he's the best and he s able to awesome stuff when he´s playing. Children should not have to come across a discovery like that in a public facility, where fun and interesting facts should be found; not racial slurs. This type of event could cause serious damage on a child emotionally and mentally. Does why, is easy to believe that if things continue with this rhythm and transforming everything, in a closer future of 50 years everything is gonna be completely knew and different. Nevertheless travel by car is easier for commute for example, because they can choose a personal timetable without a terrible discomfort of buses; in addiction there is a fair chance that by the end of this century dwellers will stop travelling by public transport, in special way if the government have invested his money in green energy and we could discover a new green car, which in turn revolutionary our life. When I was young , I enjoyed playing basketball.I thought that it's the best sport ever.It made me fit and strong.It taught me the meanings of teamwork and leadership.I Kept playing basketball 4 years continuously till I joined the secondary school.My advice to anyone starting basketball is to never giving up and always keep playing till the last minute. Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath...deep one and started to dive . That type of book, however, should not be found in the library. It makes our society look bad and taints our places of knowledge. Lastly, I would like to express how I feel about offensive religious comments being found in libraries. Every human in the @LOCATION1 is entitled to their own choice of religion. first we uses Internet to discover the world's news, from Internet we can check and read world's most famous newspaper such as new York times, the sun and also electronic newspaper.Internet also can be used to learn and to educate yourself, internet allow us to read books, magazines and short stories.Internet is the most effective way to start a business and to look for a job, many people uses Internet to work , and they earning money every month.Internet is a way to make new friends all over the world through social websites such as Facebook,twitter, and you tube.As a conclusion internet is making things better and easier, life now is always connected to the Internet. If we have an uncommom right such as freedom of religion, then why would we put books in our libraries that include rude comments towards different religions. But i know that a lot of joung people play tennis, i hope that the italian tennis player in a few years  will be very famous all over the world , then you don't wait you sign up in a tennis club and you will become a famous tennis player! This is not the truth, and it should not be in our libraries! one day Micheal wanted to go out from his home so he called his besfriend an suggested to go out togther , his friend agreed , so Michael weared his closes , wnet out and closed the door but at this moment he knew he had made a mistake . A few minutes ago,some boy who looks  like elderly than my old brother closed to the poor little boy,the little boy stopped cried,he looked on some boy,my brother felt afraid because they look like rube,but he still  wanted help the little boy. Good morning everyone,today I want to share about is my favorite sport.My favorite sport is football,why I choose it?Well,football is a international sport,people around the world will love it so much!Example like Barclay Premier League,Liga Premier,Fifa World Cup and so on.I believe that's all will delighted us.By the way,my favorite football team is Manchester United,they are brilliant,they have an amazing football players,and they are awesome. This is not what I want to happen though. I simply want the people of this community to stop and consider what is easily available for our children to obtain. The least we can do, as parents, is to take books, movies, magazines, and music containing racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments out of the libraries"	2.5

"Transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible Some people, say that computers enable internet conversations between friends, and computers pass off information about faraway places and people. My name is Anna,I am a very cheerful person and I have a creative personality so I enjoy planning activities or organise sport events in a special and  colorful way.I really love childrens and take care of them ,I also had an experience  of working in summer camps and have a good experience doing delicious food because I already did this stuff in other camps.I think that I gave good reasons and I hope that you will accept me. People exploit most of their time on comptuers, reducing their exercise time. Not many pay attention to nature, and instead of talking to friends in the internet, why not meet them at the park? I can tell you that I fell I can understand over 90% when I'm listening and when I´m Reading, but my main problem with English is of course when I must speak: I fell my self horrible without confidence, I think that always I'm thinking in Epanish and after makind the translation to English, may be in this moment when I'm writing this composition I'm making the same wrong. This is one reason why the @LOCATION1.A has the highest obesity rates in the world. after two days poleas sow some boody in crime scene the poles man ask them what did you do hear ? If we, as @CAPS1, continue to lack exercise, there won't be many possibilities for us in the future. after that the celebration was began and a lot of their friends have attended each one presented a gift for Sara , she was very delighted and suddenly the doorbell been rang  she was her old friend Tia . Pandas! polar bears, whales of different types, and other creatures all need our help to fight this extinction problem. Unfortunately, we pay much of our attention on the computer, with consideration, as humans, we make things possible, so we should help creatures in need to survive for generations. I used my car every day however few a few I started to take public transport for I can to save up money Perhaps we will find nature more interesting. Why do we have text messaging in our computers if we have the ability to talk to our frinds in a park? Its  popularity spreads all over world too.There are many reasons behind it to be popular.Everyone is able to enjoy the excitement throughout of this game the session.The people who eager to play football must follow some basic rules which are described below: 1.A football player should be punctual and hard-working. In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that doesn't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used,so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground. While reducing our social life, our computer hours are becoming more important, and are distracting what's mos important. I would like to say for anyone wants playing soccer to be very careful when he plays it because it may cause a lot of injures ,but in the same time it is very nice game."	2.5

"I want to say something about the learning of the English Languaje, is hard to get to me for the next reasons: First reason; the grammar that the learners, teachers or institutes teach, is  like the Spanish Languaje, my native Languaje. They are used to talk, for lesieure and many other things. But are computers a good thing? I choose the wheel because is the most useful invention ever because thanks to it the human works make easier by example a way to move heavy objects, compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today the wheel was invented at a relatively late point of human history, he oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia. Besides practically unlimited information, you can stay in touch with your family using @ORGANIZATION1. I strongly believe that grammar is not the most important element to speak English, if you know grammar you only know certain rules to write, but I think that speaking is most important than writing, because when you go to anyplace in the world, you have to be prepared to talk and understand whatever they say to you; in this part you may notice that if you don't know vocabulary, you wouldn't unsderstand anything; but here is another topic, whether you understand or not, you have to notice the way that people talk to you, and try to realize what the person is trying to say. Also you can use @ORGANIZATION2 excel to manage your finances! Windows movie maker allow you to contruct your own movies ifl you own a camera. Besides the obvious most helpful features, you can play computer games, watch mores and listen to music on a computer. Like anything, computers have downsides too. Some are small and some can be very big. To begin with,the format of the bank notes needs to be designed,factors of considerations including the background colour,the artwork and the security issues.Sencondly,equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps.Thirdly,print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink,where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes. You can't see who's really talking to you on a computer. Then ,preparation of mental plates and skilled machinists are the needments.Printing is the next step ,.Usually ,sheets of bank notes printed ,because there are some special require for the printing ,solour of both sides,special ink ,images slightly raised. This experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister (I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money. Bugs can also seriously damage your computer rendering it imposible to use. Many people can be smeared on the internet as well. In conclusion, for me it is a lie that the public transportation has no future, however, they have to make improvements to this like the use of better ways of fuel or energy, one way is using renovable sources of energy such as solar, haeolic (wind) or hidraulic(water),Also there are biodisel, and gasoline extracted from seaweed.And the public transportation will be more important in a few years than now. You have to be careful where you go when using the internet. Also, sometimes computers can take over peoples lives. People spend too much time on facebook and not enough time reading or keepng in touch with family. Computers can be great things. Between their great features allowing you to be informed all the time and programs that or be great for managing buisness, it's no wonder almost every @CAPS1 household has one. Many people don't like computers. They say that the cons outweigh the pros. I think my town really take care of the environment,because there are a lot of parkｓ in this town and these are very clean.However　some people are not care of environment　that mean some people throw garbage away in the park.I think almost everyone loves parks because a lot of people go to the park and having　lunch,picnic,excersise,nap etc.I think after eat something at the park then clean themselves is good. cars are faster than public transport so cars are more convenient than public transport it is easier ,faster and more comfortable especially in long distances so governments should improve public transport as not all people have cars But if your smart enough to stay away from @CAPS2-@CAPS3, install anti-virus software, and never give away your information to an unamed surce, the pros outweigh the cons. The biggest anecdote, that I have with my friend, was our trip to Disney world.Where we could visit all the parks of Disney , like Animal Kingdom ,Hollywood studios and Magic kingdom.In adittion we could visit others parks, like Universal and Bush Garden."	2.5

For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"Bell rings. Shuffle, shuffle. @CAPS1. For all the people I advise to start to play or watching football because for me it is a very good sport , but you can play a good football only if you really like it , because first football is fun . EEEE. this situation to create many pollution for environment so we have more conscience for the planet health Slam. Click, stomp, @CAPS1. Tap tap tap. SLAM. Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath...deep one and started to dive . Shoof, shoof. Sigh. So,we can say that time is a double-edged sword , either help you or agonist you and in the popular say is right that say ""don't delay the work of this day to the next day"" because our works will accumulate then it become more hard to finish it .To ensure best use of time in our life ,we need to be punctual.punctuality avoid tension and trouble things ,finally even scientists have another vision about time, they discover that time is the fourst dimension by relative theory which exchange all concepts in science. Here we go. ""@CAPS2! Tu va ou pas? On a +¬tude cette class-l+á. Tu peux aller au bibliotheque si tu veux...."" @CAPS3 all blinked at me, @PERSON1, @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1, chocolate-haired and mocha skinned, impatiently awaiting my answer. The truth was, I knew @CAPS3 didn't really care if I came or not. although traveling by car is really interesting but still using public transport has its advantages ,by using public transport you're saving  effort when  driving a car for along distance you will get tired , some people don't have enough money to buy their own car . In the public transport you don't have your own sit so sometimes you travel standing which is not very comfortable and in winter you don't have air conditioning so if it's cold in the outside it's cold inside the transport to, sometimes you have to travel with sick people that can transmit you the illness. Because I spoke fidgety @CAPS5. I think in the future don't exist public transport because we will drive their car.When you drive your own transport ,a car for example, you going to from a specificlly place but in a bus you go to the bus stop and no to your house or school, work... It is better from the people be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person. I was a flock of seagulls haircut. So why are you here? However, I think the tools should be improved, such as killer’s knife and actors'costumes, the knife looks like as brittle as a handicraft, I believe those are seconded-handed clothing. Why did you go on exchange at all? You are the complete opposite of everyone here. No one wants you. Just go home. Secondly, if you use the car, you haven't wait much time ti catch the bus or the train, and maybe you can arrive later at your job, for this situation. Lastly , workshops about conservation of environment to increase environmental awareness among people to encourage them to take care of their city , and how they can recycle some rubbish to beneficial objects to exploit it at home . I went to a  awesome concert of points of view and I know that I look forward to telling you how it was.But let me tell you it was a concert that the  performed Lala Band and I have taken and I especially, I was the cameraman.It was an excellent night.The concert was evening began at 20:00 and came a lot of persoane. In my life,many dreams have existed in my mind,which is sweet ,incredible,magical or horrible.However,one of dreams is keeping in my heart that I can't forget it forever. But, in this moment the people think different, is to start to help the world and  Contamination is big problem for us and the planet. and we must lern children that clean is necessary for their health and on their school they should throw rubbish on Waste basket and who throw it on the ground Will be punished . then when I have time and I see a senior citizen in the street  introducing their scraps bag in an wrong bank I explain them who they have to recycle and who important it is for our environment carefully recycle it For some reasons, I really liked to play basketball, first, playing basketball can train my muscle and make the body more healthier ; the second, my classmates and I all know how to win a game through the basketball game because the basketball game is a teamwork. I really had no idea how @CAPS3 felt about me. How does someone feel about their shadow? @CAPS3 notice it, sure, but it never offers up insight, it never makes you laugh. Even though do not everyone doing that,so how much public office is care of environment is important and this town is care of that a lot.Every morning some peasons are coming park and cleaned that makes feel really thanksgratitude. But I knew it wasn't that simple. I was just too alien. In the reconquest age the stronghold never downfall with a direct assault, finally the Castellan's army after a large siege force to the government surrender it. In frustration, I started to flick peas across the room with my spoon. Pat, flick, sproing. i think that this is the guestion for every one, and the answer can't be one for all, cause, someone can use public transport, and economy by this not only money, but and the environment, but some people don't like to use p.t., cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple don't like to travell with another people. Tears began to pour out of @ORGANIZATION1's eyes. Elizabeth apparent to be a very sweet girl, but Jason is not convince, because when he kiss her, he doesn’t feel nothing, he doesn’t feel that gravity disappear, and when his face turn red, he just put a face of horror and surprise , like if she was very sorry about kissing him. At first and important change is about eating prepared food that isn't healthy usually,its reason probably woman's life stile that is going to big change in the way that they don't like staying at home and spend their time to making food ,now they prefer to buy prepared good. Silently, I continued shooting peas. According to the problems above mentioned,various approaches that governmentshould be adopted to deal with this problem.first of all,reducing building constructure from now on,planting more trees instead.Sustainadle development should be awaness to all human and start to porteat the environment and preserve the animals. Even though do not everyone doing that,so how much public office is care of environment is important and this town is care of that a lot.Every morning some peasons are coming park and cleaned that makes feel really thanksgratitude. With a great effort sate down on the grass, he feels tired, and has a little sensation of pain in his boson, site there with many sounds on air, he star recall...his face is changing is dark, he has now a clear image of all, when opened the door of the house his girlfriend is there dying on the floor, Michael remember all, the fight, the lays, the screams, the knife...the blood; but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Today personal vehicle become pride of the life , mean if a person is on there personal vehicle they are look as higher status in the society . While I were in ANDRAPRADESH every year we have Christmas function in December although we are not interested to attend Drama they were not leave us without participation even simple character.They gave me a character like THE GOD .Firstly I never aware about how act and do this particular character.And from October to till December we practise everyday after our study hour up to eleven ""O""CLOCK.DAY BY DAY  I learn and finally I did my role well.Then I think myself why I wasted all my school days . Firstly, Django Unchained remembered us the hard life suffered by black people in the past, due to a great introduction without dialogues, where black people were unchained while they came back to be selling to an owner farm, it being matching with an amanzing soundtrack as identity Tarantino´s films. The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years People around us were laughing too, even though @CAPS3 had no idea what was so funny. I didn't even know what was so funny. But it didn't matter, because we were dripping tears and snot, reaching for each other, reenacting the pea hitting the boy's face. It was as if we had been friends for years, and laughing happened all the time. Firstly,design the bank notes' backgroud colour it is artwork security issues.Second preparation metal plates.It's skilled machinists.Then the sheets of bank notes printd .Printing colour on both sides and sprcial ink or images slightly raised. The connection we felt was instantaneous, like lightening, the kind of connection I felt with my best friends back home. I felt that huge swelling sensation in my chest, like a balloon was stuck inside. My stomach was aching and my cheeks were so sore I felt them seizing up. My heart felt whole even for that second. Nowadays,an increasing number of people are concerned about the phenomenon that armland ,forest and wetland is disappearing for some long-term human activities,for instant housing and transport networks is builded by destroying the balance of environment. It was the best laugh of my life. Sniffle sniffle. GASP. Laughter. GASP. Swipe of tears. Sniffle sniffle. This sport cause fresh and jolly me and I think will exercise cause healthy.if you start volleyball, you need a ball and piece of ground that separate with tie. GASP. Obesity and other thins about help, is a topic very important because the people is dying for this problem.For example, the form to prepare the food, is gonna be dangerous because a lot food have artificial thing that is no good for us. the citizens in the town must participate in this , the citizen will take the responsibility for specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish into correct place and clean tree and plant more of it . It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swimming and also when the age become older it will be more difficult to learn than the little . I grew up in a parent family.Sometimes I felt that I was alone and not loved.However,we were lucky enough to have a great mother who tried  all her best to keep my older brother，my older sister and I for completing our college studies .Of course my uncle ,young brother of my mother gave a big hand to go through the hard,so that made us often help each other in my family when the member who was in hard.Especially I was the youngest member in the family ,made much more troubles when I was young ."	2.5

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you imagine where the world would be without computers? Our daily lives would be dull and boring without new technology. Computers help society do various activities that would be impossible if we didn't have computers. Following your letter , I want to tell you about The apartment is very Beautiful not big or small medium-sized left inside two rooms, a bathroom and a dining hall and an external director categorize overlooking a beautiful view I am sure he will like it  to come and Tri condo b soon ,n the end, I would say that I miss you too much and I hope to see you soon. then when I have time and I see a senior citizen in the street  introducing their scraps bag in an wrong bank I explain them who they have to recycle and who important it is for our environment carefully recycle it The ability for an average person to learn has greatly increased. It has gone from just being able to go to school to the @CAPS2 various ways to increase your intelligence on the computer. Programs such as @ORGANIZATION1, which teaches people how to speak a language, are available on the computer. These programs are like going to school, but more accesible to the public. There are a few people are using puplic transport, like students and someone had low income.in my veiw, i can say might be the puplictransport going to e close because nobody is going to beclose that how . I love my small family.My family members are very helpful and supportive.My parents are very support.My parents are my best friends and guides.If any problems faced ,i'm went to my parents and say the problem,there are solve the problem.My family is my world.My parents are the good guides.There are my role model.some times we were go to the tour programs,it's very happy moments.My mammy told the story in night.Mom make the special foods in festivals. so, on my opinion, even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers Football is my favorite sports In my life.so,I pay more attention to it than any other things you might think of.I had been following series of football's events in and around the world at large.I took this time to command people who are sacrificing their entire life of the betterment of sportsmanship.With all that,I do have my favorite club team n country as well.And also have my favorite players,Ronaldinho,Messi and Eto'o.My favorite club is Barcelona and country is Cameroon although that I am from Liberia.I know football doesn't go by sentiments but the love of choice and what desire you the best.What really makes me to love Barcelona is that they play the football,instead of them running around.They always bring talented players that will make the club be more improved tactically.people always say this;""Barcelona doesn't buy players""it's not like,they are lacking money.We do essential purchasing of players to save more money.You have to save money for players to enable you to pay them on time.As normal humanbeings,you have to know how to spend money,where,when to spend it.it's not because you have more money then you lavish it.So,i love my team and my staff and how they run things in my team.The facts should not be hidden Barcelona is the best club team in the world,you like or not. So my idea is aii the coutries allthe people stop to use farmland,forest andwetlang to build houses grow more trees portect our world,our homestar! To conclude, computers greatly benefit us and are good. Environment is the sorrounding.there is no aleartness in our locality.they were busy in their own work.everyone were not focus or see what hapening in our place.they use to speak about how hot today is?but they dont know what makes this much hot.iam interest in planting tree and makes sorrounding clean.some people used to burn forest as if those forest is useless.man are greedy  because of all the thing  getting from the forest are free. On one hand you put all your things in the car and drive anywhere you want to, on the other hand if you feel not very well to drive, you have no money to buy a car or the downtown of your city is closed for all the means of transport except for the public ones: tram, bus or trolley bus is your wayout."	2.5
321	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"now days, there are many type of transport in the world ,bus taxi,train but train more conform then else , I always used bus in city. The son of Lucy and her husband one day he went to caved holes in the dirt for make a game, he make five holes and in the last one he found a brilliant jewelry that had been generations of gods so he started throwing that for play, one time that he take the jewelry, it consume the mind of the little guy and that cause that the jewelry liberated some sounds that only giants can hear so a mountain stand up that was the face of a giant and he perceive negative waves so he kill the guy because he had the most important relic of the gods. Althought some people think the most important influence on young adults is from their family, however, my oppinion is the most imporatant influence on young adults is from their friends. First, young adults have stronger relationship of influence with their friends than their family because young adults are spending most of their childhood time with their friends. In the South Korea, children are going to school for about 16 years that includes an elementary school, a middle school, a high school, and an university. And during a day time, children spend more than 12 hours for studying and exercising in the school with their friends. Therefore, children have to spend most of time with their friends. Consequencly, after students graduate universities, young adults will form a strong understanding among a their age group when young adults enter the society. For example, young adults who are between 20 and 30 years old, have a hugly different pollitical oppinion than a 50, 60 years old age group that is mostly their parent and family will be contained. Secondly, since many families have only a one child or two children per family, children have to talk and play with their friends in a school rather than their family. I want to turn to his hobbies, when he isn't working, he is riding on a bike, every evening he takes the bike and rides across some paths for more than forty kilometers by day, so he is very good rider and its quite strong to ride with him. Since young adults have a long time with their friends during their lifetime than their family usually, young adults would have huge influences from their friends. Despite many evidences that given in this essay, some people think the family has a big role for young adults because old adults can support and lead young adults during entering society. However, supporting of family is not happening and supporting of family is extreamly hard to do in these days. In the past, families are usually significantly bigger than current. For example, grand parants, parents, childrens and families of sibilings of parents group were formed a single huge family in the past. This first reason is all actors shown their talent in this film directly and audience can follow their steps and the story certainly, this essential element which also makes a big success to the film. Since most of family structures have only parents and children usually, therefore parents have to have enough social power to lead their children alone. But in some country, You can use underground (metro) , it is very advanced than old types like Bus or Taxi,The underground is faster and clean and arranged . Despite there is a complexity of leading children in real world, helping each other young adults by sharing information are reletivly easier. In conclusion, by many supporting evidences that provided in this essay, young adults have significance influence from their friends. other people prefer to travel by trains as it's faster and more comfortable than cars.Many countries like to travel by bikes in order to decrease the pollution which happened by car exhausted.to my point of view i prefer travelling by cars which is more comfortable. i know that i am not professional player and i am n't belong to any team  but i like this game .basketball is so simple play but it is need Speed ,concentration and The ability to determine the distances  , it  contains of two team of five player and each team try to get a high point by throwing the ball through the basket. Actually, we have a lot of problem with traffic: lots of cars in the railway and it don't running; the number of cars in the street cause a dirty pollution;  crawded railways causes a later destination."	2.5
322	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I have confessed that in the first time I didn´t like it very much because I was a bit shy boy and I cost a lot of effort to integrate with the other players of the team but with the passage of the time I liked more and more. I think tests have more disadvantages than advantages. I am going to tell you three reasons why I want to eliminate the tests. First, students get stressed by tests. According to mental health research, the first reason of suicide of students is a test. This shows students really get stressed by tests. Evaluating students is not important than mental health of them. i dont think the public transport does not have future, there are a lot of people who can not buy a car and has to use the communite transport. Second, tests make students to focus on their grade not the development. They just study to get good grade in tests and they do not study the contents that not in the tests. This is not mach with the purpose of university. University should help students to study the part which they are interested in. According to the problems above mentioned,various approaches that governmentshould be adopted to deal with this problem.first of all,reducing building constructure from now on,planting more trees instead.Sustainadle development should be awaness to all human and start to porteat the environment and preserve the animals. As I told you before because of the technology many things has become able in less time, and with the pass of the years this tend to increase. Lastly, test is not the best way to makes students study. They are called below: 1- chaharshanbeh soori 2- Norouz 3- sizdehbedar  chahrshanbeh soori:  It meaning Tuesday night of week and take place on last Tuesday night of the year .at this night people make a bonfire and jump over the fires and say to fire :I give you my sign of sickness(yellow color)and you give me your healthy sign (red color)and eat some special foods . Frist of all at home we recycle plastics, glasses, papers and cartons, oils, clothes, batteries, organics in an especial composting bank where we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials and finally all the other things are sends to an especial tip where we avoid to drop it anywhere. I would like to say for anyone wants playing soccer to be very careful when he plays it because it may cause a lot of injures ,but in the same time it is very nice game. While talking with other students, students can develop their own skills and knowledges. my town tries all the time to make our town more beautiful and comfortable by taking more care of the environment,they provide us by good buses which are friends to the environment and offer the tickets for this buses in a cheap price,they also trying to find the best way to make the rubbish more useful by the recycling,also the people tries all the time to find the best way for keep our village clean;they never throw the rubbish in the streets or the gardens,also they take care of the fuel in their cars to not to be bad for the environment,so,it's our duty to take care of our village and the whole environment beside the government. To sum up, I want to eliminate the test in KAIST because it gives stress to students, makes students to focus on their grade and is not the best way to makes students study. Norouz:  It meaning new day of the new year and  takes place on 21 March (first day of spring )this day very important for us because we cleaning our house ,buying new clothes just for new year .The major things in Norouz day is haft sin table and include the seven items which start with letters ""s"" ."	2.5
323	"Government: Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.    "	"Korea has one of the most developed roads and highways, and convenient public transportation systems. This is because Korean government spent a lot of money to improve those systems. It is large, clean and  comforktable and has air conditioning and internet wifi  it introduces many kinds of delicious foods like meat, cheeken ,sea foods and if you want anything different you will find it  there .it is suitable for my class because it is difference from any other restaurant Some people argue that government should spend more money on improving roads and highways, and some argue that government should spend more money on improving public transportation system. Although there are many debates about which system should be more developed, my opinion is that public transportation system should be more developed. Yes,I think it also can educate.As times go by,technology is rapidly improving.More and more gadgets are invented such as televisions,smartphones and so on.There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly.Using will not only gain the entertainment but also get the knowledge.For instance,there are numerous program that we can choose.It is a good time to turn to the entertaining program,when we feel bored and gaze the wall all the day.Television provides educated varieties of channels as well.Discovery channel is posture-oriented model example to educate.We can learn how do the different animals feed on themselves.Above the statements can ensure a rich and abundant live. People who do not have personal cars, such as teenagers and disabled people, must have to use public transportation systems. By considering equality, government should spend more money to develop public transportation for these people. The future for the public transport shouldn't be  taken lightly,  in my opinion, the public transport is the best option for ending the problems with the traffic jam because when we use a bus or subway , a lot of people is travelling from one place at other in only one transport or vehicle. in general, public transportation system is more efficient than personal cars or other transportation systems. My advice to travel for Spain is that there are several types of transport but the most economic is the public, most expensive transport can be the taxi, for example.But, you can travel by plane,it is not very expensive. the tecnology have chanched the people's life very much.in fact we can think how different is our life respect either to our parents or our grandparents life.for example my parents didn't whacth on tv, because there wasn't any tv on the world when they were young.but it isn't the alone difference:we can think at the mobilefone,the computer ed at least the internet.our grandparents woundn't imagine a strange machine like computer in their life. I want to turn to his hobbies, when he isn't working, he is riding on a bike, every evening he takes the bike and rides across some paths for more than forty kilometers by day, so he is very good rider and its quite strong to ride with him. For instance, smoke from personal cars is the main reason of air pollution. In addition, personal cars need parking space for each vehicle. But in Korea, these parking spaces are not efficient because the territory of Korea is small. Therefore, by considering these reasons, public transportation system should be more developed than roads and highways for personal cars. To sum up, since public transportation is necessary for many people and more efficient, government should spend more money in the public transportation system. I hope that someday, I can see more developed and more convenient public transportation system."	2.5
324	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"All of the freshmen in university couldn't experience live lectures in a traditional classroom. Nowadays, because of the corona virus, they watching online video lectures rather than watching live lectures in a traditional classroom. The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years They choose non face-to-face lecture for many reasons. Actually there are a lot of advantages of watching online video lectures, and I will notice you from now on. Online lectures aren't more time consuming than live lectures. when he come she start crying and thought he would break up with her and she did not give him a chance to talk or explain anything she started to cry louder and accused him of cheating that make michael astonished how she did not trust in him ,how she thought that about him and he told her that he can not stand that anymore he would break up with her and he left .Michael close the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake And the classroom is not a your room, so you have to prepare the things for lectures like major books, an ipad, a notebook and so on. Secondly,tourism,especially in developed countries,has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view.There are countries,such as Greece or Bulgaria,in which the econmoy relies merely on tourism.If tourism influences the econmy,it thereby influnces the environment,and if it influences the environment it influences the transport.How?people become more careful at their historcal sites,this way preserving them;Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale:At a small scale,in cities, in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently.At a large scale,people can now travel in almost any possible way:on land,on sea or air.Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations. It means that you don't need time for preparing the lecture, and you don't need to go the classroom. In addition, lecture time can be increased because there is no classroom change time. In the public transport you don't have your own sit so sometimes you travel standing which is not very comfortable and in winter you don't have air conditioning so if it's cold in the outside it's cold inside the transport to, sometimes you have to travel with sick people that can transmit you the illness. Online lectures are beneficial not only in time, but also in study efficiency. If you watch live lectures, you have only one chance to listen. Micheal was afraid he was waiting for sara to get out he went to the shore to look if she went from the other side but he found no footprints.his mother called him he went home and still thinking about sarah.it was night and ge was afraid ti get there again.he went to sleep .michael closed the door and knew at this moment he had made a mistake. Secondly, studying in university, I have to live far from house which make me be homesick, sad, and worried I have to live in dormitory with many strange friends, they ‘re very noisy and I have to share my room with my roommates. You can watch the online videos several times or adjust the speed and sound. By doing so, your lecture understanding levels are improved, and it makes your knowledge more sophisticated. this country are many interesting pLaces to visit,if you wantto have adventure you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza.If you want to have fun you may go to parque de la Costa there are many interesting rolercoasters.And if you want to go the best museum of art in Argentina you should go to malba. In a traditional classroom, you must ask questions by your voice. However, in online lectures, there is chatting window. First of all, although travelling by car  become more convenient,   the growing population which cause personal vehicle is hard to manage.The traffic jam  becomes more and more serious as far. In these diagrams below,the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly.The first step,the bank notes should be desinged concidering some constructions,like background color,artwork and security issues,After it was prepared,skilled machinists would make preparaation of metal plates in the second step.Then,sheets of bank notes would be printed by 50 bank notes per sheet,which have colour imagines on both sides in special ink.After printing well,these sheets would be manually inspected closely.It was the most important step during the whole processing.And then,some  sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets  which would be cut into and separated into equal ones andpacked and depatched to where they are demanded.

325	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"     In Kaist, there are some special systems. I think the most special system is that all students enter the university with department of freshmen. Then ,preparation of mental plates and skilled machinists are the needments.Printing is the next step ,.Usually ,sheets of bank notes printed ,because there are some special require for the printing ,solour of both sides,special ink ,images slightly raised.

There was a island that each year in some moth come a hurricane this island is located  in a equator then the people went to this island currently but they can´t went when the hurricane is there because they can dead in the hurricane. Students can choose a major whenever they want. I will explain 3 reasons. First of all, there are AP courses in KAIST. He seems different, she never imagined that Jason can be like that, she fantasy with someone, brave and strong, and she never foresees something like this, but she feel something for him, maybe she is in love with this guy . They can skip some subjects in basic subjects like Calculus, General Physics, and General Biology. ""Annabelle"" is a horror movie which i am going to watch this Saturday.I am wondering if i will be scared after the movie.The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was closed in a museum from Conecticut where she is visited  by a preist  who blesses her twice a month.John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife :a beautifull colection doll dressed in a wedding dress.Unfortunatelly,in a horribble night the couple""s house was invided by a satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them.The satanists invoced an eavel entity that is capabale of the worst things...Annabelle.After Mia gives birth to her doughter Lilly,Annabelel wants to kill her.Even the preist doesn's know how to help the unhappy familly.Everyone is terryfied and find out that a demon is attached by the doll.Idon't know the end of the story but i don;t think that is a happy one... For me, I got 4 AP courses in 9 basic subjects. Therefore, I just have 5 subjects to take in a year. In our earth, Hunderds of millions prople living in here.Except us, There are also a large number of wildlife. MEASURES IN FAVOUR OF TAKING CARE THE ENVIRONMENT The council is carrying out a project in order to erradicate the rubbish in my town.This project is focused on separating the rubbish in each green points of the city and also they have to maintain their neighbourhood as clear as are possible. Second, there are many students that already decided a major. At first and important change is about eating prepared food that isn't healthy usually,its reason probably woman's life stile that is going to big change in the way that they don't like staying at home and spend their time to making food ,now they prefer to buy prepared good. this situation to create many pollution for environment so we have more conscience for the planet health I also hate it. Her sons have a problem they cant see the natural light and one they Grace got up because her children were shouting and crying so she went to their bedroom and the courtins was not there so she go to the other room and the courtins also were not there so she stars getting nervous and more nervous so she go and talk to the servants, so she got very angry and she told them go out of my house and they did not care so she pick up a gun and the old lady returned her keys. Therefore, we nearly did not study, and get bad grades. I think it is too bad. Students have to take uninterested subjects though they already choose a major in theit mind. Finally, this system makes hard to graduate in 4 years in KAIST. To take many major subjects, 3 years are too little. I strongly believe that grammar is not the most important element to speak English, if you know grammar you only know certain rules to write, but I think that speaking is most important than writing, because when you go to anyplace in the world, you have to be prepared to talk and understand whatever they say to you; in this part you may notice that if you don't know vocabulary, you wouldn't unsderstand anything; but here is another topic, whether you understand or not, you have to notice the way that people talk to you, and try to realize what the person is trying to say. I think, choosing a major in second grade makes hard to graduate. So, lets start, Most of the Metro cities are now days attract people of city towards Metro only not just because of the fare but because of the time that it saves. For me, I will be able to take a major class instead of General Biology! Finally, Taiwan still suffers economic slump, but we have so many businesses likes to innovate, market their product, customers likes to buy it. To sum up, many students got some AP courses, and already decided a major. Three words that describe me really good is: happy funny and sometimes bothersome A thing that i would like that people knew is that its not a good idea that wake me when im sleeping. They have to take uninterested subject, cannot take many major subjects in first grade. As I told you before because of the technology many things has become able in less time, and with the pass of the years this tend to increase. If students could a major whenever they want, these problems will be solve."	2.5
326	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"From my point of view, I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job during their college period. The following are some reasons why I consider having a part-time job is better. To begin with, going to a college is like a preparation for establishing your future career. Students learn and study knowledge for what might be useful one day. subsequently,this step is most important.bank note should be inspected.bank notes separated into good and bad if get good quality sheets,the next stage is packaging and distribution.at this stage sheets should be cut into separate bank notes,packed,and dispatched. In addition, having a part-time job can help you to gain respect from peers and establish relationship with others. Take myself as an example; I was once working in the National Theater as a receptor. I learn how important it is to communicate and listen to costumers. I had truancy and did not pay attention to studies.That really the biggest harm to a hard-working woman whom my mother tried all her best to feed me up and help me complete my studies.All the members of my family never give me up,and I finished my college studies ,too .I have a good job now.I do really thank my mother and all the members for paying the patient and exertion to me .Now we have  great relationship with each other and treasure the happiness  we get not so easy.So,are the members of my family my best friends？I'll answer you ：there's not much better answer than Yes！ After waiting an hour the time comes and bravely  with high confident level he walke to the office. The tight schedule nearly made me fall to pieces. when am in the court other side participants are fear take off my service ball and am very at my position to cover the entire court. I became more patient with people, welcoming any criticism. In conclusion, having a part-time job can help college students learn more efficient with lots of experience and handle pressure well with patient and welcoming criticism. As a result, it is important to have a part-time job for college students."	2.5
327	"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"@LOCATION3 has always been my place of choice to travel to whenever my parents question me of where I would like to go during the @DATE1. The rolling green hills, stunning sunsets, and thrilling thunderstorms are certainly a large part for my reason to go, but the idea of seeing my @CAPS7's side of the family again overpowers all of my other reasons. We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben, which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye.To got to the Big Ben we took the underground, but to get to the London Eye a red bus.After 3 days we went home.I forgot to tell you something about homeless people.A lot of people are homeless, which is sad, but maybe we can change it. Yet, due to the fact that we live hundreds of miles apart, I'm only able to see @CAPS1 @CAPS2 three times each year: my family drives up to her house twice every @DATE1, and she drives down to my grandparent's house for a few weeks in the @DATE2. I cherish every moment I spend with her, especially when she accidentally makes a fool of herself and causes hysterics. A few summers ago, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, my @CAPS7, and I traveled up to @LOCATION2 to check out some of the town's antique and flower shops before dinner. To start with,there are a wide range of troublesome it maybe leadding to this phenomeon.Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the persent day cities are already packed with places of residence,commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce.Additionally, people now continues destroyed more agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their need,which will distory the ecosystem  diversity and biodiversity especially the endangered species. I had lost interest after the first few hours; antique shopping was never a passion of mine, and I was ready to take the one hour trip back to @LOCATION1 to go swimming with my cousins. Once @CAPS7 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had spent most of their money on a couple of ""treasures"" a few hours later, we were exhausted and prepared to head home when we happened upon a pizza shop down the main street. the movie I´m going to be reviewing is ""the purge""  I actually loved it quite a lot, I just loved all the suspense and the parts they leave you hanging, it´s just way too interesting, the movie is about the american government who annually gives 12 hours where all crime, even murder, is legal, and there are no medical services during that long period of what they call ""the purge"" and anyone can join it, you can kill whoever you want. In her white @ORGANIZATION2 pick-up, my @CAPS1 pulled into the shop's parking lot, leaving @CAPS7 and I inside while she grabbed the pizza. Egypt have more historical places such as pyramids is the one of empirical in the world and more people from around the wold come to see this pyramids the wold think how Egyptian people make this building from may be thousand year and still stand without change and more tourist come to take photo in the pyramids and study the stone and how the old Egyptian make this one without modern tools such as cranes and other modern machine more scientific teams come from all the world to study this building and make Egyptian science in more universities around the world to study how the air going inside this building and how it keep the food inside it and how this big stone takes out from far places and come for this place and how this building keep the body of the people after died and how this people leave inside the building and why this building like this and what the benefit of this building and how to make kike this building @CAPS1 @CAPS2 placed the pizza in the back seat, grabbed her coffee, and revved up the engine. I love to work in the summer camp job to make the exercise every shop in usa should make the summer camp job , I am the right person to work because I'm very exercise and I' love to work in the kitchen, because i am the right chief in the summer camp job. public transport is very crowded so you may not have a seat .I hate public transport as I was attacked by mad man once .also taxi is  not a good transport .I wish I have my own car soon to get rid of public transport . My advice to travel for Spain is that there are several types of transport but the most economic is the public, most expensive transport can be the taxi, for example.But, you can travel by plane,it is not very expensive. Moments after the initial panic, we realized that @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had accidentally driven over the curb. We burst into laughter while poor @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had a red-rose face and an apologetic smile wider than the @ORGANIZATION3. She cautiously drove with the traffic, laughing hysterically with tears in her sea blue eyes along with @CAPS7 and I. this country are many interesting pLaces to visit,if you wantto have adventure you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza.If you want to have fun you may go to parque de la Costa there are many interesting rolercoasters.And if you want to go the best museum of art in Argentina you should go to malba. I wiped the tears from my eyes, trying to stifle the laughter and recompose myself. To begin with,the format of the bank notes needs to be designed,factors of considerations including the background colour,the artwork and the security issues.Sencondly,equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps.Thirdly,print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink,where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was doing the same, and then turned around to look at me. She locked her bright eyes with mine and smiled as sweetly as only she could, and we burst into more hysterics. After @CAPS28 next small hysterical episode was over, we were finally able to pull back onto the street with the rest of civilization. My favourite sport is playing tennis.I play it three times a week (on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays) in the club of tui.I had been playing tennis from 2 years ago with two of my best friends.I enjoy playing tennis because it is a sport that requires skills, concentration and speed.I am not very good at all but I like to play it with my friends and do matches on Saturdays . @CAPS28 drew up another round of laughter. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 has always been there for me, through the laughter and the tears. With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of population,many agricultueal land,forest and ocesn had been used to destroyed to build more constructure and transport networks.From my own perspective,I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human  and animals. Yet without laughter, @CAPS28 bond would not be nearly as close and glued together as it currently is. Hundreds of miles of farmland and open road separates us. In my opinion, public transport in my country will never improve because my country is so poor and beside it is considered one of third world countries and another think must be taken into consideration is they the politicians are horrible they have destroyed my country The future for the public transport shouldn't be  taken lightly,  in my opinion, the public transport is the best option for ending the problems with the traffic jam because when we use a bus or subway , a lot of people is travelling from one place at other in only one transport or vehicle. But every time I see her, I smile and think of the comical stories we have between each other. Secondly, do more cooperation between countries.To illustrate, people should cooperation To intervene to bring peace to the world to stop the war in many areas like what United Nations doing.For example, United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy ."	2.5
328	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"There are company so much,they make our life polluted.To take care of the environment,each of us has to do anything such as propaganda to the people in the country,...about my village, we use banana leaf stead of nilon, garbage desposal sensibly...and so on. Further to the trade fair of the last week where we were a pleasure to meet you and we were talking about you courses. We're looking for a new nice home and so we are truly interested to keep your place tide and take care about it as it were our own. First, smoking is a basic human right, even though it may do bad to the smoker's and others' health, we cannot forbid one from smoking. Therefore, restaurants allowing smoking provide spaces for those who want to enjoy eating and smoking at the same time, and then these places can further gather those who smoke together and leave those who cannot bear the smell of cigarettes a comfortable place. Moreover, smoking is a special culture, and we should not wipe it out from the diverse society. Some restaurants provide the water-smoke devices, and smokers gather together to share that habit, and tourists even come to visit that kind of restaurants. Invention of car has made people's lives easier.No more they have to solely depend on public transport.Though public transport are cheaper and one could get to know many companions ,increase network.But public transport has fixed schedule and on a rushing day not many can really enjoy their journey. Still, unlike drugs, which in a little amount can lead to people's severe and immediate damage of body and the loss of working ability, cigarettes are not so dangerous, only by a large amount of smoke do cigarettes harm people's health. She told me not good at all, but my was good and she also added that you may got the chance and finally I got it.After three days later our result has been published and I got the chance but the girl didn't. Smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."	2.5
329	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 are you? We were all excited, those from Lala Band minunate.Their voices have positive vibration through their musical and give you a good feeling.On the scene moves very well and know how to take pleasure to the public.I am feeling wonderful and my promise is that when going to have a special occasion to go to a concert supported by Lala Band, you will be with me.As like this in all my heart.I hope as those recounted by me in this mail and you feel a slight vibration from the concert. I am writing this letter to explain to you why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons why I am writing this letter is that people could contack with friends and families from far-away places, computers helps you leran more about different parts of the world and also computers helps people understand and learn more about life. That's why I believe you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people. about my rest of family , as I said before they are just a relatives , but even if they are not friends almost ,but I do love them to much ,first one is my aunt ,the dead one ,and the other who still alive ,but i don't feel that felling of love towards my uncle , I do love him ,but he is just my uncle no more . An example to support my reason is that people from all parts of the world have families different places. And they cannot have a good contack with them. On the one hand, there are alot of famous player on volleyball who had Knee ligament injuries ,The most frequent mechanism of injury was landing from a jump in the attack zone.In addition to this,Injuries were more frequent during games than training. Sometimes the employers do strike and we clients do not known in time as a result we can not get on time to work,that is one of the disadvantages of using public transport. In our earth, Hunderds of millions prople living in here.Except us, There are also a large number of wildlife. The diabetes is the increasing  of the glucosa in the blood, The have two types, first the Diabetes Type 1 that is predent in childrens, pacient needs insuline every day, also this diabetes is caused by the destruction of the insuline realized by the person´s immuny siste. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Second of all why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that computers helps you learn more about different parts of the world. An example is that if you don't know anything about a country or a place you could go on the internet a research and learn more about that place. This shows that computers is important to have. Another example is that when I have a project or a essay and I don't know about it. The mas was armed try to steal the backpack.But he not be fixed that the man was a camera in his head and hi action was filmed. And by doing this it will help me on my project or essay. Norouz:  It meaning new day of the new year and  takes place on 21 March (first day of spring )this day very important for us because we cleaning our house ,buying new clothes just for new year .The major things in Norouz day is haft sin table and include the seven items which start with letters ""s"" . Strange things happen in the house, they are ""intruders"" in the house, anne saw many times someone called victor who ""play`s"" and the mother thinks she is lyeing but after a while she believe her and started searching for the intruders. An example is that if you don't know if something is right or wrong you could look it up and it @MONTH1 help you. This shows that computers can give advices. I'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant its name is ""Lemon"" I go there every week it has different food from any restaurants I'd like chicken crispy with garlic sauce It's Excellent choice for me and My favorite appitizer is susage and in order that desert I'd rather ""Vadge"" cake with chocolate sauce I feel I;m at ease when I go there I enjoy  classical music over having a lunch about the service It's very good and all staff are respectable I can't imagine one week without going there that drives me nuts I advise any one to go there and enjoy  a time there , also this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really It's  excellent This strikingly thing for anyone  despite all of these advantages prices are not expensive . If you are trying a new resipie and you are not sure on @CAPS3 to make it. And it will give you the inderigant and direction to make that food or snack you want. That's why I believe that you and all others should believe that computers have a positive effects. In conclusion why you should believe that computers have a positive effect is that people could contack with friends and families, computers helps you learn about different parts of the world, and also computers helps you learn and understand more about life. I would hope you read and reread this letter and consider about believing that computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion the public transport is very good and if it desapear it will be a big problem, is right that some times you need a private transport but apart from that the public transport is very use by people of all ages."	2.5
330	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"It is well known that people going to some restaurant or bar have a right to look forward to a good time-spending and pleasant meal. Unfortunately, all their expectations are often being spoiled by the odour of smoke. my advice is be patient, be smart this sport not easy but it's need more trainee, more time to be one of the greatest player in the game My name is Abrar saeed Al-mubarak.I'm 13 years old.I live in Saudi Arabia(Riyadh)  .And i'm in grade nine.I have 9 sisters with me we 10 .And 9 brothers.I really love to learn English lounge & French lounge spinach lounge  .And I speak Arabic . Should the government prohibit all these people from smoking in public places? In my opinion it should certainly do this. the first day we went to Taormina and Giardini Naxos, the day after we visited Siracusa, the third day Agrigento and The valley of the temples and the last day we saw Marsala and Trapani. All people standing around that person breathe in contaminant smoke. the public transport  have no future , the crisis in 2008 ; has been down the oil prices .The oil is cheap now and new cars are more efficient and the goverment give stimolous for consumers. Secondly, it is strongly uncomfortable for non-smoking people to get into a bar or restaurant where cigarette smoke wafts. For instance, when family with children wants to eat out, they usually look for a place for non-smokers in order not to let children have a contact with unhealthy smoke. Finally, if smoking was banned, there would be fewer smokers on our streets. So when this prohibition was imposed, perception of people would certainly change. At first, I had called a travel agent but he said he couldn’t be able to book me a flight before two months, so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent."	2.5
331	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries.

Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"public transport has a big role in transportation specially in large cities like Capital city of countries,  using the car some times causes traffic jam if all person uses their own car, to avoid this a good roadways is needed, also the cost of public transportation is lower than private transportation. But many would disagree with that. Fdi can play important role in it.It give competition to national companies .By virtue of which they  work properly mannerly and give better option to policy holders.people can always buy nominal premium we should aware them about the types of insurance as well as benefits of the insurancce. They can gives us facts about a certain topic that we @MONTH1 not find any where else. After waiting an hour the time comes and bravely  with high confident level he walke to the office. In this view, I consider, though, there is lots of sports on Televison, they are not too much, because the people have looke for it. For many kids, no matter what age, they only rent books from a library for two main reasons: pleasure and projects. my advice is be patient, be smart this sport not easy but it's need more trainee, more time to be one of the greatest player in the game I love to listen to British English, but it’s really hard to study, all because we are all learning American English in Taiwan, so when I have the opportunity to contact British English, it’s full of tone cadence, always feel particularly charming, and British culture exudes noble temperament, so British accent sounds like there is always an indescribable elegance qualities. Moreover also simple things are changed, for example the food we eat: some times ago everythingh was natural, healthy... but now everyone eat always ""junk food"" and thinghs like that, which are completely unhealthy ! For projects, such as for school, it would depend upon the librarian to censor the book to a child. Coat of arms of the city of Rybinsk is a scarlet heraldic shield,over which - green with golden beach pier for which the output is black rebelling bear holding in the left leg on the left shoulder golden ax, undertwo silver starlet So it really all depends upon the use of the book and the maturity of the person who is renting it. If they feel that it will not be appropriate for some, then they could give a suggestion to censor it. Movies and books are different in many ways. Books allow you to create a mental description and picture in your mind for what you are reading. as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! Firstly,the growing number of private cars cause the big problem with traffic jam .People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam.That wastes people's time and make people feel exhausted.Not mention to say,it's definitely hard to enjoy travelling in holidays.Secondly,private  cars are the main reason for the air pollution.We should consider the protection of environment for human future,not only care about the convenience we can see for now. In conclusin,the whole part of process is an unreversed schedule.It cosumemed the power which contained the humanity and machinic.Nevertheless,in my opinion the most precious of the revolution is the modern security measure through such a muti-developed society. then when I have time and I see a senior citizen in the street  introducing their scraps bag in an wrong bank I explain them who they have to recycle and who important it is for our environment carefully recycle it They @MONTH1 still be censored if they create too vile of an image, but that is up to the one who watches it. i like volei because it was part of my life and of life of my mother, is my favorite sport, but i like over sports too, same i don't play volei because I'm bad, and my friends that know, don't like of  peoples bad of volei.I'm watching they playing, they're really very good, but when play over school, they're very bad Everyone finds themselves quite fond of a certain genre of music, and most of the time sticks to it. Music, like movies, is also rated by the content of the song. If it has a word or two that should be sensored, then it is most likely already labeled 'explicit'. I think that music, just like movies, should not be able to be censored, because they are already rated accordingly. Some books, magazines, and movies contain cold hard facts about the past years of our world and are too vile for anyone. And even though those events are in our past they are still very important to our present. Books can be a magical place for children, as well as adults, to go and create their own world. To censor a book, movie, or magazine would be taking away that chance for someone to enjoy life just a little bit more for that small moment in time."	2.5

First, computers are good for communicating. Students @MONTH1 contact teachers through email if they have a question about an assignment. Computers also are useful for teaching. People use the @CAPS2 everyday to get information on their favorite sports teams or on a new recipe they saw on television. people that they play in this categorie are fameous althoug you can see them on tv.if you want to be a big football player you must to practise more time and yoor life should to be healthy. Student and employees use @ORGANIZATION1 for everything from writing a paper to creating a presentation. Futhermore, computers are extremely essential to our everyday life because they help us communicate, learn and finish work. When he was just about cursing the final line he got hurt and his mussels was dying and star to peel off a black matter, at that point the guys in suit thought that he won’t be able to cross the line , but when they saw that he kept running, they freeze the time and run after him, he stopped for a moment but then , he start running again and when he cross the line he woke up in a red somber fluid, he was wiped out from the matrix, he opened his eyes and saw a flying robot, suddenly he was on a wood wheelchair and they said that he would never be able to walk again , besides that, he stands up and tried to walk again. Computers are one way of communicating to @CAPS8 loved ones in far away places. Parents send messages via email to their children at college. Families speak with each other through @CAPS3. Computers are what makes all this possible. cars are faster than public transport so cars are more convenient than public transport it is easier ,faster and more comfortable especially in long distances so governments should improve public transport as not all people have cars For all the people I advise to start to play or watching football because for me it is a very good sport , but you can play a good football only if you really like it , because first football is fun . It is large, clean and  comforktable and has air conditioning and internet wifi  it introduces many kinds of delicious foods like meat, cheeken ,sea foods and if you want anything different you will find it  there .it is suitable for my class because it is difference from any other restaurant Also, if a student has a paper due the @DATE1, but their printer is broken, they @MONTH1 email the paper to the teacher. This allows the student to get full credit for their work. Email is not onlyuseful for handing in projects, but also for asking questions about the assignments. the actions of this film took place in Alexandrie city of Egypt and it talks about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they didn't have much money to produce their own albums , that sort of bands is   famous between the youth and they call it ""under ground bands "" .their songs give a big concenet to the political and social stituation in Egypt and they become famous after the25 january revoulation , why I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society , there is no chance for the youth and if they found it , they face lot of problems to save it and they didn't find time for other activties and in sometimes they worked in thing which  they never learn or love I went to a  awesome concert of points of view and I know that I look forward to telling you how it was.But let me tell you it was a concert that the  performed Lala Band and I have taken and I especially, I was the cameraman.It was an excellent night.The concert was evening began at 20:00 and came a lot of persoane. Also in the sort way, we should go walking to the destination.icle If we are working with  sameone in the same jobs, and  who lives near or he is our neighbour, we can go to the work in the same car, this way we use less oil. The average person goes on the @CAPS2 ten times a @DATE1 just to get information. i don't know my name .i don't know my age all i know about that i want to be a great woman ,i want the world to hear my voice , to prove that i can do it  i can do any thing  i am not weak i have woman power Search engines like @ORGANIZATION3 or yahoo provide answers in less than one second. This is much faster than going in the library and spending an hour looking it up. So if you want to work in Egypt you must have a complete information about the job (location ,salary,incentives, Allowances , work environment,position titles , company type,policy ,mission,vision)                                                                                               With best Wishes                                                                                                Sameh Sabbagh For example, if a person is living in the @LOCATION1, and has lived there all their life, but is reading an article on a website about an animal native to @LOCATION2, they would not know how to picture it in their head. Articles and books @MONTH1 provide a description, nut nothing really gives the person a solid picture. The person could go online and search for a picture, which they will surely find. Finally, computers keep the brain active. But, in this moment the people think different, is to start to help the world and  Contamination is big problem for us and the planet. So for finish competition with pleasure I needed work out plan witch is diary day by day about our jogging distance, time, mood during work out. Even though do not everyone doing that,so how much public office is care of environment is important and this town is care of that a lot.Every morning some peasons are coming park and cleaned that makes feel really thanksgratitude. Overall, computers are one of the most useful and common of the learning devices. Many people say that computers are useful. All this will help people to live easily, but only to have more time to work, because the type of mind that reign that time will focus in the companies and make money and spend it, this is the reason why a lot of jobs are changing to a home office and the firms are giving more and more facilities to their employees to be more efficient. The most important step is inspect the notes which are good quality sheets and which are bad sheets.If the sheets are good,those sheets are then cut into separately and packed into cars in order to dispatach all over the city.If the sheets are bad,those sheets are then destroyed through burning. This is because of programs such as @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS8 programs allow people to cerrect spelling and grammatical mistakes while at the same time creating a neat looking presentation. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people with bad spelling or grammatical habits corrected @CAPS8 mistakes quickly through @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6. If people constantly make grammatical or spelling errors, then having them underlined in @CAPS6 will show them that this is not the correct way to punctuate or spell something in a sentence."	2.5
333	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Today more than @PERCENT1 of our population spends expensive amounts of time each day on the computer. I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. after two days poleas sow some boody in crime scene the poles man ask them what did you do hear ? I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? Firstly it is clear that more house and transport networks is convenient for our people,what is knowed to us is that the population growth is a big problems,which is needed for more palce to living.And builing more transport networks is also benifit for us,for example ,the high-speed rail can be shorteded our time in traveling.while the animal may not welcome to it, That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. This is due to Lima in the beginning  has not had a pant to desing its public road s and highways, and it only has been improvising to build their way without any criteria to transport its population. as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Although the public transport is slow but it also do not take a long time of people to reach their destination because public transport nowadays are developed more fast and enough. The most important step is inspect the notes which are good quality sheets and which are bad sheets.If the sheets are good,those sheets are then cut into separately and packed into cars in order to dispatach all over the city.If the sheets are bad,those sheets are then destroyed through burning. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. think has a future that all people use public transport then I think that maybe continue to have future but has bad and good things , for example good is easier to move in the city and you save time, and the bad , bad people attack you and steal things, but I thing ,that have future ,because a lot people even they use public transport to. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. I like a car as well,but when I have to driving a car I have to think about parking a lot and I can't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am having travel,so the public transport is making connection with human beings.It is why I think public transport is really important for public and there are a lot of important thing is having a possble in the future. If the person want to become bowler then concentrate on running,action,stance and for batsmen need concentration on lag and bat coordination,eye and bat coordination,discover some shots which became key factor in batting. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the ""great deals"" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. the first day we went to Taormina and Giardini Naxos, the day after we visited Siracusa, the third day Agrigento and The valley of the temples and the last day we saw Marsala and Trapani. It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. When I was returning from syleth I called the girl and talk to her and assure that I got chance in university but girl says that she knew it. Tennis, tennis is not jsut a sport anyone can play but it's professional sport needs to more hard trainee and more time to be perfect in it, in first why I choose tennis?, seriously in 2003 this is my first time to watch the game on TV when I saw roger federer played I think he is the one that made me love this sport, due to it's professional motion in playing the ball, from this time I was interested in this game and watching all championship, so more time, time and time it was my favoirite sport. The answer is simply; this museum has many types of momias.In 1810 have been a war for indepedent of Mexico many people were fight with other people; for example: Miguel Hidalgo is considerate: ""The father of indepedent"" and he was to fight with monarquia Spanish. I grew up in a parent family.Sometimes I felt that I was alone and not loved.However,we were lucky enough to have a great mother who tried  all her best to keep my older brother，my older sister and I for completing our college studies .Of course my uncle ,young brother of my mother gave a big hand to go through the hard,so that made us often help each other in my family when the member who was in hard.Especially I was the youngest member in the family ,made much more troubles when I was young . Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe. Instead they should spend time outdoors, with family: or enjoying life!"	2.5
334	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"This afirmation: travelling by car is so much more convenient say everything, for example if we think a lot of time we spent on wait bus to arrive our destiny, the traffic is a lot of things that everyone prefer  buy car it more practical and fast. Everyone has to deal with censroship whether it is directly or indirectly. There have been many complaints and arguments involving the government regarding acts of censorship throughout the past. If censorship were to be equal for everyone, there would be nothing left in the world to be censored. Censorship is a major subject when dealing with books, newspaper articles, movies, and other literary subjects. The writer or director must be able to create an interesting topic or story line while at the same time keeping it appropriate for most audiences. in my personal obinionits better to lern froma teacher not only dat you lern to pronounce the words correctly you also lern from a personwhat is in my opinion way better i thin k we spend enougth time on smart phones so i dont think its the best if we use them to lern as well. Coat of arms of the city of Rybinsk is a scarlet heraldic shield,over which - green with golden beach pier for which the output is black rebelling bear holding in the left leg on the left shoulder golden ax, undertwo silver starlet Censorship is wrong, especially in the @LOCATION1; the @LOCATION1 citizens are granted the freedom of speech and the freedom of press. What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player ,i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families, Censorship is wrong because it violates at least two of the five basic freedoms granted to all @LOCATION1 citizens. So they make a plan to display all... The next day when they were about to start filming they ere non ants there so they search for them, but they can't find them... In that moment the ants and Penny attack them in their backs, making them to leave the place. I reduce use of innecesary power at home, in other words,I turn on light that I need for the while i use it;I take less warm shower; I hit only neccesary rooms. We can change  everything hurt us if we need if we have volition The reasons for  stress are more diverse perhaps because  we have an  exam period,  family proplems or because we think in negative way,  or we destroyed  ourselves  in long hours of working and canceld our needs  for enough comfortable,  and  lots of reasons to stress...   We must get  out of  the stress quickly before  lose ourself because it's very hurtful period, for example you can read a  book,  doing sport,  play music,  eating delicious food, remmeber  all the positive thing was took place with you,  talk about someone who trust for him,  take off every thing make you upset and make you life tiring,  go out and eat meal with your best joking friends,  and  there a lot of you have to do...   Remmeber the stress is not  lasting thing,  and you can avoid  it  But if you  are willing  to live in happy life. Further to the trade fair of the last week where we were a pleasure to meet you and we were talking about you courses. We need to push for less censorship in the @LOCATION1, because if we want to keep our five basic freedoms of life granted to us by the first amendmant, then we need to fight back censorship and remove it completely from our society"	2.5
335	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"There are many accidentally problems encountered by international students studying in Australia.It is believed that the most important one of the problem is culture barrier.Because of different culture backgrounds,the talking  style of internaional students who come from different countries are various. Today is different with yesterday, and tomorrow will be different with today. In this wave of changes, some people say that if some try nothing, then they will not lose anything; however, in my opinion, taking risks or chances has several benefits for success in life. Hey my name is Joe and i´m 21 years old and i´l think i´l would compliment the summer camp very good, because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak. television entertains as well as it will educate the people.These days are educating themselves by watching the television.Televison not only provide entertainment it will give lots of information about the happenings around the globe.Channels like national geographic and animal planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origination of species.Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people I advise any one dream to be one of the most famous teams that works on hisself a lot & and play football a lot to be profectional in this sport & show a lot of matches &followed by captain supervised on him Only people who try the first can get some kind of success. Even if some may fail at the first time, if they actually took some risks or chances at the first, they can try again. In addition to pioneership, people can learn in fail as well as success. in a car accident , when she her what happened with her brother she was so nervous then the miracle happened she found a big suitcase in the train she decided to open the bag because no one was in the train so she opened the bag she surprised when she saw  a lot of money inside the bag  . If some try nothing and just plan, for example, then they will not be able to know the things. Experiences are the best teachers in lives. Some argue that careful planning is needed to achieve success; however, in my opinion, taking risks or chances is essencial for success because people cannot predict everything in future. The future of public transport in developed countries is very different, because most people have a car, in   the people who live in poor countries, most people take public transport, because people doesn´t have a car and is cheaper take public transport, the pollution of public transport is huge and is growing third world countries should have, eco friendly transport. Just doing leads people to success. Spent half an hour after we arrived, started coming everybody, there were many greetings, thanks, hugs, kisses, and then we all went to the table, which was magnificently structured, plenty of food of all kinds, drinks, but we were all waiting for the main course, also the food was magnificent, but the best part was when the couple went to the pool, we were lucky we had an amazing wedding planner who arranged the magnificent and fun activities, he said to the bride and groom enter each an inflatable ball and try walking on the water as long as withstand, and the bride won because the groom slipped and fell after them, out of the ball, fell into the water, and kissed. Success can be only acieved with pioneership and fail can be good teacher. That I want to say, is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb's in Spanish Languaje, just Imaging you the same but not in your native lenguaje. Just do it."	2.5

"Dear @CAPS1 of The Local Newspaper: @CAPS2 students are promoted to higher grade levels, more teachers will require research papers. The social networks such as: Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,Google plus... are connecting  us to more and more friends, companies, public figures, books, films, social organizations...we are really have many things to see, to think, to ""like"", to ""comment"" and a dozen of stuffs that we can make an action to interactive with others...so may it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves, to take care our healthy. What makes students and parents more happy to see @CAPS3's on their child's paper? Advances in technology. there should be advances in technology because they teach hand-eye coordination, it gives the ability to learn about far away places, and people, and even allows people to talk online with other people. However, public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a new car and for the adventurer who want to have an exciting travel for then to see more action.Like watching outside or sight seeing,to mingle and meet different people.In addition to this I also admire the bullet train in japan which u consider fast and safe public vehicle Ive'd known. The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots. @PERSON1, a professional tennis player @CAPS4 that, ""@CAPS5 I started using a computer, I always, would play tennis for living and it was a bad choice because I was poorly coordinated. The television is one of the most important AV media in the world.You can use it for many purposes, according  to your needs .There are a lot of channels in many roles,for instance , education , movies, songs ,sports,news and so on .The television is not only for entertainment but also for education .The television can entertain you through it's entertained channels, and the television can educate you through it's educational channels. my English   language is weak , I like to improve it which complete my post graduate study,      The reason for choosing this specifically English language  in September  future I would like to get to know more information about   an English language course . Then I started to use the computer more and my coordination improved. But a good change of our habit is attention to calery food and healthy food because of get information on internet and another media that are accessible way for all people easily these days. @CAPS6, @CAPS10 advances in technology will improve and teach hand-eye coordination. Another reason there should be advances in technology is because it gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people. @PERSON2 @CAPS7 a writer from @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 that, ""People like to research a place @CAPS5 they go on vacation or a buisness trip because they would like to know more about it."" Not knowing anything about your vacation destination is like not knowing what's for dinner tonight, it is clearly unreasonable. Recent studies show that the more a person knows about their vacation destination the more enjoyable it is. we all know that do sport is very important to keep our life healthy and happy.My favourite sport actually is walking;and I prefer walking in the morning and before sundown.I like also walking in public street,gardens,clubs and on the shore.when i want to go anywhere;I do my best to go on foot.I like this sport since my childhood because I found that I can think about my good time when I was child and relax with myself to think carefully about my present and future.The walking can also fitness and do the knee stronger.It would be interesting to accompain your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time.I advice my guys who suffer from laziness and overweight,try to walk one hour at least and after that they will like this sport. One thousand people by eighteen and more are questions in my town about their way takes care of the environment.Investigation reveals the youngsters are more than ever power to  save the world from waste and pollution. positives ways for playing badminton: you can lose weight , you vision will be good etc   negatives ways for playing badminton: you right arm is more strong than you left arm , sometime,you are sprain your arm . Furthermore, @CAPS10 advances in technology will allow people to talk online with other people. @PERSON3 @CAPS8 the creator of @CAPS9 @CAPS4 that, ""@CAPS10 online chat programs will help people communicate with each other. My name is shousheng and live in Montreal Canada.Alrough Canada is an English country however in Montreal, the offical language is Freach. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , that ha has planned two weeks ago  this episode was his sister's birthday ,"" Now it is the suitable moment to announce her about surprise "" peter said . It is also very beneficial to students because if they forget a homework assignment they can log onto @CAPS9 and ask a classmate."" Some public transports  as trains do not contaminate as cars or motorbikes.Many people said that public transport is not confortable, thats true, from my point of view bus is not so unconfortable. Secondly,tourism,especially in developed countries,has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view.There are countries,such as Greece or Bulgaria,in which the econmoy relies merely on tourism.If tourism influences the econmy,it thereby influnces the environment,and if it influences the environment it influences the transport.How?people become more careful at their historcal sites,this way preserving them;Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale:At a small scale,in cities, in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently.At a large scale,people can now travel in almost any possible way:on land,on sea or air.Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations. In conclusion, @CAPS10 advances in technology will improve hand-eye coordination, teach people about far away places and people, and allows people to talk online with other people. When voting on this decision please take part and support advances in technology, it will be beneficial to everybody. Thank you for your time."	2.5

"Dear @CAPS1, Computers have been an incredible help to many people as they advance in knowlege. But, many people do not think about the negative affects of computers. Computers make research easier to find, and they organize data well and quickly. Computers make comunication easy, but there are many negative affects as well as positive. Chat rooms on computers are a great way to communicate quickly, but they can also be dangerous. More and more kids are spending time on computers, rather than outside excersising and communicating with friends and family. In conclusin,the whole part of process is an unreversed schedule.It cosumemed the power which contained the humanity and machinic.Nevertheless,in my opinion the most precious of the revolution is the modern security measure through such a muti-developed society. Her mom tried to tell Fernanda that they arrived very late because they had a very perplexed problem, so her mom told her that they came out from the park at 9:00pm it was still late but not too late, so they were on the street and the police arrived because they police thought that she had a globe with wine, and her mother told the police that she doesn't have alcohol or wine on her car, and they police didn't believed her and they took them to the police station so they could check his car, and about 10 minutes approximately they told her that she didn't have nothing so they, went from there to their house and it was late, so that’s the reason. But kids aren't the only people that use chat rooms. Adults use them too. Some for good, others for bad. People can travel through the city easily and safely.For instance Melbourn,the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area.Therefore people don't need to drive cars for travelling in the city.The last point is people go for long journey by public transport.Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive. They can communicate easily what has been done and what needs to be done at the office such as what bills have been paid. This is a good way for workers to know whats going on outside of the office. For some reasons, I really liked to play basketball, first, playing basketball can train my muscle and make the body more healthier ; the second, my classmates and I all know how to win a game through the basketball game because the basketball game is a teamwork. After preparing of metal plates by skilled machinists,it takes sheets of bank .There are three requirements fot it:colour on both sides,special ink and images slighty raised. Computers are good for finding information quickly. Computers are useful to find information for school projects. Computers can also take that information, and organize it on graphs, and computer programs such as microsoft powerpoint. Other pluses about computers, are that they can teach hand-eye coordination. Suddenly we heard the sound of running footsteps.Then there was a cry and the footsteps stopped.Nervously,we walked back.Perhaps someone had been killed,or kidnapped in the street We were going to see what happened ,and we had something to see.There was one old granny who was beat up.We try to gave her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that.Than we were trying to find help ,but nobody was opening doors.On our luck I had a mobile phone ,but Michael was saying that we need to escape because we did not know are those bullies near the corner.My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I've done that. After 4 days all came with spectacular pictures, portraits of people, large sculptures, to a student, her name was Sandra, she arrived with a piece of crumpled paper, old in which only had a name written in a style different letter, only there reflected, exposing the moment everyone laughed at her for her work, but the teacher said: Art is complex, and seeing that everyone laughed with the work of his partner, can see that nobody understood the real meaning, since art is different for each person, each creates a different definition, so we must respect each of them understand that each person is a different world and everyone is art. This experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister (I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money. This makes reading the assignment easier for the student as well as the teacher. There are many advantages to computer, but there are also disadvantages. More and more kids are spending is their free time on the computer, instead of ouside exercising. So for finish competition with pleasure I needed work out plan witch is diary day by day about our jogging distance, time, mood during work out. I think that any one wants to start sport can play squach which  gives stretched  and  healthy body,in the same time this sport can be played for a long time of period without caring about the age. Kids today are using a new language in chat rooms as well as texting. They are using abrevations for words and phrases, such as ""idk"" for ""i dont know"". First of all,we should thinking out a design and dicide the background colour and artwork,or even security issues.And then for the preparation of metal plates ,the skilled and machinists is considerate.Nect,printing,sheets of bank notes printed (50 bank notes per sheet)colour on both sides,and specWell,the most important step is inspection,we should printed sheets manually inspected. Although chat rooms on computer can be useful, they can do also be dangerous. Kids as well as adults go into chatrooms and talk to other people, saying invalid information about themselves. Such as age. Playing the cricket will also gives physical exercise to our body.we can bowl,batt,field in the cricket which  requires lot of  physical activities. They talk to kids until they find out something like an address, phone number, school, and district. Once they got information like that, they can find out many other things about kids. Above all,the design is the most previous way we should know,which is considered with the background color and artwork.Secondly,we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinsts.And the we need printing and inspection.Eventually,the most essential part comes out,we need significate the quality of the sheets.If it's good,packing and distributin whereas the others shoulde be distroyed as well. While I were in ANDRAPRADESH every year we have Christmas function in December although we are not interested to attend Drama they were not leave us without participation even simple character.They gave me a character like THE GOD .Firstly I never aware about how act and do this particular character.And from October to till December we practise everyday after our study hour up to eleven ""O""CLOCK.DAY BY DAY  I learn and finally I did my role well.Then I think myself why I wasted all my school days . The biggest anecdote, that I have with my friend, was our trip to Disney world.Where we could visit all the parks of Disney , like Animal Kingdom ,Hollywood studios and Magic kingdom.In adittion we could visit others parks, like Universal and Bush Garden. To begin with,the format of the bank notes needs to be designed,factors of considerations including the background colour,the artwork and the security issues.Sencondly,equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps.Thirdly,print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink,where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes. When I was returning from syleth I called the girl and talk to her and assure that I got chance in university but girl says that she knew it. Parents would be less concerned about their childs safety and health if kids only used computers for homework, and were safe about who they talk to online. Also, what kids say in profiles. If all of this happened, there would be a balance, and I think people would be less drasticly over a period of time, and people would be more comfortable."	2.5

With a great effort sate down on the grass, he feels tired, and has a little sensation of pain in his boson, site there with many sounds on air, he star recall...his face is changing is dark, he has now a clear image of all, when opened the door of the house his girlfriend is there dying on the floor, Michael remember all, the fight, the lays, the screams, the knife...the blood; but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! The @CAPS1 helps them speak to others that they normally couldn't have a conversation with. basketball needs that the person should be tall enough to play it .i like basketball because it makes me happy,fit,have self_confidence and makes me active .if anyone want to play basketball ,he should do many exercises and try to be able to play it because everything is difficult at first but we shouldn't give up . What could have taken months by letters in the mail took as little as one hour to do over the @CAPS1. Another way to speak to friends or family is a website called @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is a website that allows you to speak to, @CAPS6 or send pictures to others. If the  print sheets has good quality ,they will packing and distribution.some partially damaged  will cut into separate or packede or dispatched .The bad sheets will disposal ,the destroyed will be secure. In conclusion, for me it is a lie that the public transportation has no future, however, they have to make improvements to this like the use of better ways of fuel or energy, one way is using renovable sources of energy such as solar, haeolic (wind) or hidraulic(water),Also there are biodisel, and gasoline extracted from seaweed.And the public transportation will be more important in a few years than now. Multiple servers proud @CAPS6. such as @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, or @CAPS8. But in some country, You can use underground (metro) , it is very advanced than old types like Bus or Taxi,The underground is faster and clean and arranged . That is one reason why I support the use of computers. Another reason I support the use of computers is because <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of all students rely on the @CAPS1 for research papers and other assignments. To combat the distriction of enviornment,this is a serious problem throughout the world.Nowadays ,many trees and grasses are damaged in many countries,lots of building are constricated.And people should pay attention to this problem and try to slove it. ""The @CAPS1 is so much faster and the articles are more up to date. Search @CAPS13 are most popularly used, such as @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS14.com @NUM2, of all computer users with @CAPS1 access have @ORGANIZATION1 at some paint. Another handy program provided by all computer companies is @CAPS15 @CAPS16. This program is used from everything to research papers to. This program also has a spell check, a punctuation check, and a check for mistakes. The main reason I am writing this paper is because experts have been complain that people have been spending too much time on the computer and @CAPS11 has been distracting them from the important things in life. Such as friends, family, and nature. However, from the examples explained in this paper, I have shown that the @CAPS1 increases conversation and curiosity of how the world looks and operates. We can change  everything hurt us if we need if we have volition The reasons for  stress are more diverse perhaps because  we have an  exam period,  family proplems or because we think in negative way,  or we destroyed  ourselves  in long hours of working and canceld our needs  for enough comfortable,  and  lots of reasons to stress...   We must get  out of  the stress quickly before  lose ourself because it's very hurtful period, for example you can read a  book,  doing sport,  play music,  eating delicious food, remmeber  all the positive thing was took place with you,  talk about someone who trust for him,  take off every thing make you upset and make you life tiring,  go out and eat meal with your best joking friends,  and  there a lot of you have to do...   Remmeber the stress is not  lasting thing,  and you can avoid  it  But if you  are willing  to live in happy life."	2.5

"Summer holiday, I have been to Italy on holiday 3 years ago.I didn't have a long holiday ,it was just for 3 days but these 3 days were the best in my life.I must say that I went there because my sister is living there so I didn't have to book a room at the hotel and spending too much money.I went to the Vatican and Rome,I saw their massive buildings which were impressive and their old houses.The weather was fantastic ,I love bathing in the sun and resting on the hot sand on the beach. No progress will happen without plan .Each one has a dream want to achieve it but first of all he need to put a plan and also cognitive one . Also in the sort way, we should go walking to the destination.icle If we are working with  sameone in the same jobs, and  who lives near or he is our neighbour, we can go to the work in the same car, this way we use less oil. first we uses Internet to discover the world's news, from Internet we can check and read world's most famous newspaper such as new York times, the sun and also electronic newspaper.Internet also can be used to learn and to educate yourself, internet allow us to read books, magazines and short stories.Internet is the most effective way to start a business and to look for a job, many people uses Internet to work , and they earning money every month.Internet is a way to make new friends all over the world through social websites such as Facebook,twitter, and you tube.As a conclusion internet is making things better and easier, life now is always connected to the Internet. My favorite way to travel is the Plane because  I like to be fast and in my life, I hate a wait in my opinion the plane is the best for me for example when you want to go  somewhere you need to reach there so quick , you don't need to take time and The plane is the best travelling in the world that the best safer than other way  , you can see on the pollution of people who got an accident , how often an accident happen by the plane so anyway if it's happen,i can't imagine it , Eventually I wish everyone who like to travel is safe and sound and safe journey. Censorship of these books is unjust because of the right of free speech and press, because all subjects are deserving of being written, and most importantly because target audiences deserve books written in their interest regardless of their approval. The first reason that their should be no censorship of novels and works of literature is because writers deserve the freedoms of speech and press. They are aloud to voice their own opinions and write about the subject matter that they are most interested in. Though many times they have used subject matter that is highly provocative or inappropriate, they still have the capacity and the legal ability to write about what they wish. most of girl doesnt like this,i think that it takes us energy,we need to do exercise,reasonable diet...and so on. Millions of books were burned and hundreds, if not thousands of writers were executed for conveying opinions in their work that conflicted with the ideas of their government. Even though there are books not written for all ages they are still deserving of a reader. The next reason that books should not have censorship is because new ideas cover topics that have never been discussed. Books and stories are meant to push the mark of what has been written and what can be written. The variety of literature is the reason why it is so popular. For thousands of years, written text has been a way to understand and connect with cultures and people through written language. And though stories @MONTH1 not be written in a manner that would be appropriate for a child, it doesn't mean that the story shouldn't be written or read. Its use should simply be monitored so that only those capable of accepting or understanding its message are capable of reading it. Lastly, censorship is simply unjust because without it there is a better chance to discuss and attempt to describe stories that target a vast crowd of people. Obesity and other thins about help, is a topic very important because the people is dying for this problem.For example, the form to prepare the food, is gonna be dangerous because a lot food have artificial thing that is no good for us. And to limit the literary subjects that people prefer could be parallelled with limiting a person's voice of opinion. It simply isn't reasonable to allow only a single category of work, with only a few varieties of messages, for only a select group of people. To my mind our lives has been improved in these years by smarphone, satnav, digital TV, Internet.. Let's suppose a teenager of twenty-first century during the Middle ages.. don't get out alive without Wi-fii! Therefore, censorship of literature should not be enforced. One they animals went with Ana and give her an incentive for being an athlete or make something else than stay sleeping. And because writers have the right to illustrate their points through a literal medium, there should never be a limit on these rights. That is why censorship should never be able to remove a piece of literature from any shelf."	2.5
340	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Computers have been one of technoligy's greatest advances, and yet one of society's downfall. Originally thought to spread ideas and faraway places, computers have been proven to do quick the contrary. Computers are dangerous devices, and are targeting young, wholesome kids. It is the main reason why society is today, predicting that this future generation is wobbling on an unsteady and weak foundation. These devices, the source of this mayhem, must immediately be removes from society because they take away the true benefits of life, have harmful effects on our health, and support some of the country's deadliest predators. Firstly, computers are linked with the crime of stealing the pleasures of childhood. After preparing of metal plates by skilled machinists,it takes sheets of bank .There are three requirements fot it:colour on both sides,special ink and images slighty raised. Adolescent has always been the hardest part throughout anybody's whole life.. turning out in a fleeting glimpse into an adult, perceiving the other side of life,how tough and complicated it is, trying to deal with its different circumstances.. at this point you merely have a brief look at your whole life, many questions spinning in your head, accusing yourself of being a lost cause, wishing if you could turn the clock back,,but it's all no good.. then you find yourself standing ahead clouds of reality, which sucks.. life is stages, this stage of your life is timeless, no way out.. at some point you wish if it was all illusio, you need a time machine makes it possible to go back in time when you could see the purity of life.. However..here you are completely different made of life lessons, preferring to make a stiff upper lip..cowering in your own reality. I played so good that everyone gave me congratulations but thats not all one of the best team of the world wanted too take me. n the town he tries that the people have to aware about the sitiations and they take care  the environment   On the other hand, the ask is if this solution could be enough or no. In addition, my major is English so teachers will teach and explain by English, which I can’t catch up on lessons well in the first time. But why public transport have no future to stand and keep going?, that's because of the people that changing their mind, they start like having their own way to travel, Privacy also an important reason, people need to have a private means of transportation. As long as the computers are plugged, they emit invisible wares of electromagnetic radiation. These waves are linked to diseases and cancers. Hey my name is Joe and i´m 21 years old and i´l think i´l would compliment the summer camp very good, because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak. Leukemia, when caused at a young age, is difficult to cuse and stants the child's development. in my personal obinionits better to lern froma teacher not only dat you lern to pronounce the words correctly you also lern from a personwhat is in my opinion way better i thin k we spend enougth time on smart phones so i dont think its the best if we use them to lern as well. To start with,there are a wide range of troublesome it maybe leadding to this phenomeon.Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the persent day cities are already packed with places of residence,commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce.Additionally, people now continues destroyed more agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their need,which will distory the ecosystem  diversity and biodiversity especially the endangered species. Lastly, computers are harmful because they also a deadly we open. As an adolescent unthinkingly says the web and chtrooms, they are at risk of atteck by thousands of children predators prowling the web. But in some day tow guise with quad bike and they saw some thing wrong they sad what's that , they sow dead body , they skared and run to ther camp . With one click, acfepting a strongers inivte, the online predators hack into the child's computer and obation such valuable information. Or the predators @MONTH1 be less postive and attack directly-asking questions to the child themselves. This is due to Lima in the beginning  has not had a pant to desing its public road s and highways, and it only has been improvising to build their way without any criteria to transport its population. when I find me in London, I'm going to the buckingham palace located in the city of westminster and I'll see your art gallery and tourist attraction of the British monarchy continue in London, I will visit to the largest parks in London, the hyde park that having a full day of guided outdoor games and activities for perservation thereof park follow in London I'll go for a walk to arrive at the big ben that is the most beautiful bullding in all its splendour when I will take pictures later, I'll take the underground of London that is a public fast transit system, I'm trawiling in it when I'll leave of the underground in the station wembley park I going to the wembley stadium where I will enjoy an evening of football, the match started at 8:00pm A couple devastating, weeks later, the girl's reamin in were found, burned, as the last deadly act the predator performed on the teen. Three for, computers are simply too dangerous, a predator's thumbbook as they search for their next victim. by removing the computer, you eliminate the threats online predators pose for your child and you as well. It is amazing to learn that technology's greates advanvcement, the computer, can unleash such harmful effects. In the end, large colleges admit largest number of students, so the student may do establishing friendships more from different nationalities, also it serves the community by graduating many students in various majors. By removing the source of all these troubles, those acts can be prevented and society @MONTH1 begin to the pain for reform."	2.5
341	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"  We need love from family than friends

  Both of family and friends effects to making personalities on young adults. Suddenly we heard the sound of running footsteps.Then there was a cry and the footsteps stopped.Nervously,we walked back.Perhaps someone had been killed,or kidnapped in the street We were going to see what happened ,and we had something to see.There was one old granny who was beat up.We try to gave her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that.Than we were trying to find help ,but nobody was opening doors.On our luck I had a mobile phone ,but Michael was saying that we need to escape because we did not know are those bullies near the corner.My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I've done that. Although they are mandatory elements of learning and adjusting to be an adult and have responsibilities, I believe that young adults need more family's love than friendships. There are three reasons why I argue family's love. First, young adults can feel love easily, quickly and longer than friends. There are many kinds of love in the world. people can love someone to marry, be friends or friendships. Also, all kinds of love need some attitude for opponents so people should learn how to love and act for others. Then, there are educations by many experiences and love from family can give that experiences. I think one of my favorites sports of all is the atletism I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself, you have to be every day better than you where yesterday, it force you to improve every time, also is an exercise that help all your body, especially the legs because it gives them great strength, but also your hands because they have to be in a constant movement, and all the body in general because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and help you to have coordination. Therefore, family can give most of experiences to learn love. Second, family take care of person when they hurt or feel bad. People cannot be happy every times. Sometimes, people fought we others or felt really bad because of love. If difficulties was told to the families, the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation. In conclusin,the whole part of process is an unreversed schedule.It cosumemed the power which contained the humanity and machinic.Nevertheless,in my opinion the most precious of the revolution is the modern security measure through such a muti-developed society. Michael and Kate was so  happy, until one day that Michael said to him dream to be a super hero, Kate get so nervous saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid dream and that Michael was only dreaming but that would never happen and that super hero don’t exist. n the town he tries that the people have to aware about the sitiations and they take care  the environment   On the other hand, the ask is if this solution could be enough or no. I reduce use of innecesary power at home, in other words,I turn on light that I need for the while i use it;I take less warm shower; I hit only neccesary rooms. Because they have their works and if they do not continue their lives, finally their family are hurt. In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life, but majority of ones is totally utopic. Third, people met and made relationships or friendships less times than family. When people meet friends, when they complete meeting, they go home. This means although people have many works, meetings and things to do, people come back home. Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath...deep one and started to dive . After 4 days all came with spectacular pictures, portraits of people, large sculptures, to a student, her name was Sandra, she arrived with a piece of crumpled paper, old in which only had a name written in a style different letter, only there reflected, exposing the moment everyone laughed at her for her work, but the teacher said: Art is complex, and seeing that everyone laughed with the work of his partner, can see that nobody understood the real meaning, since art is different for each person, each creates a different definition, so we must respect each of them understand that each person is a different world and everyone is art. To sum up, I believe that people need family more than friends. There are three reasons why I argue. Firstly,hyrid cars only allowed to use during weekends as result of this most people not using there cars all the week. so, i`m rely thinking left this sport.Everyday i get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends.i`m exercising more and more again to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world.i`m champion in my sport so, i`m seek to do all my effort to be the first one in the world.finally I did not find encourage of my family or my teachers. Although there are people who believe young adults need friends than family, I argue that young adults need family."	2.5
342	Lifetstyle: Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"Getting Up Early in the Morning Is the Better Choice
Setting a pattern when to wake and sleep is important because it determines that the condition of the whole day. When the pattern was changed, the condition of the day might be lowered; therefore, choosing the pattern between getting up early in the morning and later in the day is important. Getting up early in the morning is better than later in the day for several reasons. First of all, getting up early will protect biorhythm. In the end, large colleges admit largest number of students, so the student may do establishing friendships more from different nationalities, also it serves the community by graduating many students in various majors. Transportation is very important in cities,villages as well as in sub-lines.Many people has no vehicles,they only depends on public transport due to some reasons.Any way in some cases,car is very useful to reach the destination very fast. television serves the multipurpose of entertaining and educating people.in order to cope up the competiting world and get recognized in the corperative world one must strive hard,which in turn increases their stress levels.Television has become one of the means to reduce the stress levels.besides providing entertainment television has also become a source of information. In conclusion the public transport is very good and if it desapear it will be a big problem, is right that some times you need a private transport but apart from that the public transport is very use by people of all ages. Working and playing in the day are common senses around society. There are a lot of stores and coworkers in the day; however, there are a few of stores and coworkers. It is more easy to meet friends or coworkers in the day than in the late night. As long as i try to keep doing thing on a ecofriendly way i realize that i am give a little from my side and i feel careful of my environment. Some argue that the efficiency of work is the most crucial factor; however, when considering dying, the most crucial aspect that everyone should focus on is the health. Ferrari making one of the fastes cars on the word, but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac, how they were in the past.If sameone like cars then should go to Formula 1 race to hear the bolid engine sound, I think that is the best voice which I have ever heard in my life.Formula 1 it is also  dangerous sport, the driver are exposed to the risk of  accident at high speed. I am from spain so my foreign language is Spanish I start to study another language when I was a child, I started learning English because every one said that English is the future language, when I finished my school time I tried to study French but it was so difficult for me. These things will affect the health. Besides, it’s also an environment problem, exhaust fumes engulfed the earth, more car is used, more exhaust gas release, we are killing our mother. It protects biorhythm, reinforces relationships, and health. First of all,we should thinking out a design and dicide the background colour and artwork,or even security issues.And then for the preparation of metal plates ,the skilled and machinists is considerate.Nect,printing,sheets of bank notes printed (50 bank notes per sheet)colour on both sides,and specWell,the most important step is inspection,we should printed sheets manually inspected."	2.5

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"There are many reasons that computers are a good thing for the world. They let us learn about far away places without us even having to leave our homes. To our relief,she was saved and when we went to granny room,we saw smile on her face.We were also happy,but in Michael head came a lot of things.He knew that if we escape at that moment when the granny was at the ground,she would most probably die.Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Lastly they teach us hand-eye cordination that is a much needed skill that can help you get through life. The fantastic thing about computers are that we can learn about far away places without having to leave the comfort of our home. People of all different countries @MONTH1 be inquestitive about where they came from. Yesterday ,I had a wonderful day  .In the morning I went to a Galician basketball training with a coach of Spanish selection ,when  finished went to my parents to a hotel to eat and stay with some friends , after the food meet with  friend´s of my parents and went to a theme park and we rode to a rollers coaster, it was very exciting and we ate a chocolate ice cream, it was delicious .At night we went to a match  of Spanish basketball league, Obradoiro versus Real Madrid and that match won the team of Real Madrid and then I went home to sleep. All of this is possible and much quicker then watching the news or weather channel. Computers allow us to search the web and arm ourselves with knowledge. The marvelous things about computers is the speed of them. Often the evolution is return of origins however I hope that the man in the next years will be to don't forget the past. However if you go on your computer and use the internet it makes you life much easier and the faster you can look up somes part of knowledge the faster you might be able to make dinner or even enjoy a nice walk outside and breathe in the nice icy crisp cold air. My advice of finding work, is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work.But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase. Maybe a minute later there is a suicide bombing that you might like to know about or the stock might go up one-hundred points or go down one-hundred points. This is all valuable information that people would want to be one-hundred percent accurate. Abortion is an immoral act that people make as everyone has a chance to survive and nobody has the right to decide for anyone life.Abortion has to be taken seriously in order to avoid these immoral action as these fetus are being deprive of their right since they have already a life.People had to be sensitize about abortion in order to decrease the number of women being abort.Furthermore,abortion is very dangerous and a great number of women had been death with this.Children has to be protected before and after life,it is why abortion has to be stop With webcams that are attachable to some computers or some that are embedded within the computers you can talk to them. The village I live, there is a lot of vegetation for that reason we try to protect environment, some of the things we do is to give mantainance every week to the vagetation zone checking if there is any garbage, to avoid this we teach the younger´s enviromentalist actions so they don´t throw cans,paper,or,candies to the floor they also can help the older people, there are cases which a person throws garbage to the street´s,floor or to the vegetation to avoid that happening again we have a punishment that is to pay some money if the don´t they wont be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again, unless they were visitors, in that case we told him or her the way we live in the village and, we give him or her advises to keep a beautiful place without garbage. Meanwhile, different countries have different rules.For example,people always walk on the right of the road in China .However ,Australian’s rule specify citizen drive on the left of the road.Secondly,loneliness would be a big problem when a person who leave their own country getting away from family members and close friends.Thirdly, students can’t be accustomed to western eating habits like burgers,pizza and bread .According to the unfamiliar environment students may lack the sense of security.There will evaluate viable solutions to the problem.The most important way is that individuals should participate in student activities which held by the students from the same nationality so that they may not feel lonely .At the same time they can also actively communicate with local students to acquire more information  about  Australia culture  in order to suit quickly. Webcams are a could way also in discussions. Such as you and your friend are joking and she says something you think is rude but you can't tell that she being sarcastic you might get into a fight. We have a lot of shopping facilities, it is the good thing about living in a big city like Madrid, because we have a lot of different shops since clothes shops, pets shops, food shops, shoes shops, accessories shops, toys shops, presents shops and much more types of shops that know I can not remember, but you can find almost all you want or you need it is not incredible? In my life,many dreams have existed in my mind,which is sweet ,incredible,magical or horrible.However,one of dreams is keeping in my heart that I can't forget it forever. Firstly, the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel.Secondly, the public vehicle route are more far than usual route.Thirdly,it is also crowded and no privacy.Finally,there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker. Hand-eye cordination is an important skill that is acquired. looking at the information in more detail.Initially,bank note should be considered the design such as background colour ,artwork,and security issues.then,the preparation of metal plates is next stage.bank note should be skilled and machinists.thereafter,this stage is printing .worker should pay attention to colour on both sides,special ink , and images slightly raised. This skill is also important if you have a job that invloves computers because you need to know how to type and move you fingers fast if you want to suceed in this well payed job. This skill also helps provide a wide range of other suceesful jobs in the world. Computers in the long run are magnificent machines that makes life a lot easier and fun in acquiring knowledge. If you don't have a good hand-eye cordnation you should get a computer because it will help a lot. One day Penny discovered it and it go to tell it to his queen, the queen at knowing that she get very confused but at the same time she get mad and she wanted revenge. In conclusion computers are the best thing that has been introduced to man kind so far in this world. It allows you to do do many things such as news and how the world is doing globally and how the economy is doing globally. Also it allows you to stay in touch with your family no matter how far you live or what country that you life in. Lastly computers teach you the important skill of hand-eye cordnation. Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe, in fact there is some important tournament where participate all important Europe team,They are called ""Champions League"" and ""Europa League"".football is a team sport in fact in this sport participate everyboby without exclude nobody."	2.5
344	University:Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year. Others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.	"Students should be Specialized in One Subject

     All students attending to universities have their own major. Normally they would only take classes related to their major, but taking classes from other subjects are also possible. Some say that universities should require students to take classes in many subjects. people ,espicially grnerator's owner, start using Canaopies, using very long pipes to get rid off as possible as they can from the polution. To start with,there are a wide range of troublesome it maybe leadding to this phenomeon.Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the persent day cities are already packed with places of residence,commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce.Additionally, people now continues destroyed more agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their need,which will distory the ecosystem  diversity and biodiversity especially the endangered species. The content of university classes is very high-level, so students have to spend immense time to understand it fully; it is difficult to fully master a single topic. If universities require students to take classes from other subjects, they will end up not knowing fully about any subject at all. Secondly, many students are interested in a single subject. Requiring students to take subjects that they are not interested is not only hard for them, but also violates their rights to learn what they want. i think that this is the guestion for every one, and the answer can't be one for all, cause, someone can use public transport, and economy by this not only money, but and the environment, but some people don't like to use p.t., cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple don't like to travell with another people. For some reasons, I really liked to play basketball, first, playing basketball can train my muscle and make the body more healthier ; the second, my classmates and I all know how to win a game through the basketball game because the basketball game is a teamwork. I think my town really take care of the environment,because there are a lot of parkｓ in this town and these are very clean.However　some people are not care of environment　that mean some people throw garbage away in the park.I think almost everyone loves parks because a lot of people go to the park and having　lunch,picnic,excersise,nap etc.I think after eat something at the park then clean themselves is good. It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swimming and also when the age become older it will be more difficult to learn than the little . Therefore, having shallow knowledge of multiple subjects will make students hard to adopt to the real world. To sum up, universities should require students to specialize a single subject because it is hard for them just to know fully about a single subject, students are normally interested in a single subject, and the society requires experts of a certain field. Forcing them to take classes in many subjects will only make them to work harder, with only minor benefits."	2.5
345	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Dear USA Summer camp I reply to your advertisement for work with children this summer in summer camps, have looked after children aged 5-10 and it was a fantastic experience, worked at school in north Africa like a volunteer and learnt a lot about children,  think that i'm a suitable person for the job because use to be an energetic and cheerful person and very hardworking, love working with children and  like organising several types of activities, I'm not very good cooking but i can learn very fast. One example that shows this circumstance is that some students prefer to study alone, while other prefer to study as a group. Her mom tried to tell Fernanda that they arrived very late because they had a very perplexed problem, so her mom told her that they came out from the park at 9:00pm it was still late but not too late, so they were on the street and the police arrived because they police thought that she had a globe with wine, and her mother told the police that she doesn't have alcohol or wine on her car, and they police didn't believed her and they took them to the police station so they could check his car, and about 10 minutes approximately they told her that she didn't have nothing so they, went from there to their house and it was late, so that’s the reason. Others claim that it is more efficient to study with a group of students, because they think it is efficient. However, I strongly disagree to this claim. I think it is much efficient to study alone. think has a future that all people use public transport then I think that maybe continue to have future but has bad and good things , for example good is easier to move in the city and you save time, and the bad , bad people attack you and steal things, but I thing ,that have future ,because a lot people even they use public transport to. On the one hand, there are alot of famous player on volleyball who had Knee ligament injuries ,The most frequent mechanism of injury was landing from a jump in the attack zone.In addition to this,Injuries were more frequent during games than training. They seemed to have too much fun or become too competitive. Even though the study group maintains to function well, I think the process of understanding and memorizing should be done individually in the end. We can change  everything hurt us if we need if we have volition The reasons for  stress are more diverse perhaps because  we have an  exam period,  family proplems or because we think in negative way,  or we destroyed  ourselves  in long hours of working and canceld our needs  for enough comfortable,  and  lots of reasons to stress...   We must get  out of  the stress quickly before  lose ourself because it's very hurtful period, for example you can read a  book,  doing sport,  play music,  eating delicious food, remmeber  all the positive thing was took place with you,  talk about someone who trust for him,  take off every thing make you upset and make you life tiring,  go out and eat meal with your best joking friends,  and  there a lot of you have to do...   Remmeber the stress is not  lasting thing,  and you can avoid  it  But if you  are willing  to live in happy life. Also, in order to meet study groups regurarly you need to match all the schedules with group memebers, which can be time consuming and cumbersome. Some people say that we need study groups to prevent studying passively. last year I saw a movie called ''side by side'' , and talked a little of life in old history  , and coincidence I was having this matter in school, then it helped me a lot. If you have a study group, you ask your questions to your friends. This may appear to be active process, but in fact it is a mere shortcut. It is not helping your academic skills. . For instance, I once asked questions to my friend who takes the same class. after that the celebration was began and a lot of their friends have attended each one presented a gift for Sara , she was very delighted and suddenly the doorbell been rang  she was her old friend Tia . This would not have happened if we were not so convinced that we can rely on each other. The better way would have been googling, searching books and asking questions to professors, since we have professors and teaching assistants that will give us better answers. Thus, sometimes study groups prevent you from studying more actively. To sum up, do sports is very important for teenagers to which the body is going to grow and do it regularly is commitment that we should take. In fact, statistic shows that this preference is general in engineering school. This is because we do not have to share our opinions when it comes to undergraduate level math and science."	2.5
346	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"If the public transport will be by higher quality, faster and fewer rates, majority of citizens will be prefer: is more calm to relax and read a newpaper or a magazine during the way in a collective transport than an indiivdual one; moreover, the time spend up to go and came back will be reduced, because it promotes less car in the railway. Frist of all at home we recycle plastics, glasses, papers and cartons, oils, clothes, batteries, organics in an especial composting bank where we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials and finally all the other things are sends to an especial tip where we avoid to drop it anywhere. One thing about censorship is that it is just a way the government can control what everyday people say, hear, listen to, read, or even see in today's society. We shouldn't be controlled on what we can or can't read, watch, or listen to. Following your letter , I want to tell you about The apartment is very Beautiful not big or small medium-sized left inside two rooms, a bathroom and a dining hall and an external director categorize overlooking a beautiful view I am sure he will like it  to come and Tri condo b soon ,n the end, I would say that I miss you too much and I hope to see you soon. When someones words get beeped out for saying something vulgar or innapropriate. The second thing about censorship is that no matter what it is, where it is, or even who it is someone will always have a problem with it. This experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister (I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money. Most of every person I know that has read those books knows that sorcery isn't real. other people prefer to travel by trains as it's faster and more comfortable than cars.Many countries like to travel by bikes in order to decrease the pollution which happened by car exhausted.to my point of view i prefer travelling by cars which is more comfortable. I think most people just view something that could be entertaining to one person as completely disgusting and disturbing, just because it is a little bit different, I find that as unique not bad. The third thing is no matter what public libraries shouldn't be censored. Everyone views things differently and they all have different tastes in music, literature, and films. Just because someone likes something someone else @MONTH1 find vulgar doesn't mean they should just be able to remove that from the library's public shelves. After all the library is public and I put a great deal of stress on it being public because every person in the world today are all different. Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship. There was a island that each year in some moth come a hurricane this island is located  in a equator then the people went to this island currently but they can´t went when the hurricane is there because they can dead in the hurricane. I'm sorry to today's society for not being able to realize that most of its problem is trying to control everything that everyone does"	2.5
347	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Also, just for young children that are in process of growth and development, physical exercise is essential to do it, because they can have a healthier life.Young children try to effort, and wants to win at this age, and if they train results were better and encourages to keep training.In psychic way, if you are adapated forms relations and create new friends. Yes computers definetly have a positive effect on society. Computers teach hand-eye coordiantion, give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places and allows people to talk to other people online. Computers put a positive effect of people. First, Computers teach people hand-eye coordination. I mean, computers help people learn how to use there eyes and hands t the same time. After an exhausting afternoon, Peter has a bit of luck, infact his father Jack has just came back from the work, so he could get to take the milk and giving him a passage. my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long. The reason is the next, three days ago, he was working when a girl of his job asked him whether he had girlfriend and he told, I had one, come on you know my ex-girlfriend then she only walked without tell nothing. In conclusion the more you get to learn hot to use a computer the better hand-eye coordinated you will be. Second, computers allow people to be able to learn about far away places and people. i mean that a computer can help you learn about a faraway @CAPS3 without paying a fortune in money to go the @CAPS3. I remember the time @CAPS4 my mom and dad was going to go to @CAPS1 to see a lot of the landmarks and my uncle came to my house with a brand new computer and my parents ended up staying home and saved themselves a large amount op money. Famous explorer @CAPS2 smome says ""before I go anywhere I always google it on my computer to learn about life, climent, etc, on the @CAPS3. First,the bank notes are designed by consider,thinking from background colour,artwork,security issues.Then,the metal plates are preparated by skilled machinists.And then, the sheets are printed,operator should pay attention to the colour on both sides,special ink,and images slightly raised. In conclusion, computer can help you save money and help you learn. i was at this team for 5 years and the made me even better in football.I played my first match at 16 years old and i felled very special because i was 16 and i was capable of putting 3 goals. i mean people go to special websites just to talk to friends. In a recent time privet transport is more convenient than public transportation,although public transport  like buses, train ,ferries and intercity rail are consuming less time and energy but sometimes its create problems. Shows that @PERCENT1 of people talk to other people over those websites. After 4 days all came with spectacular pictures, portraits of people, large sculptures, to a student, her name was Sandra, she arrived with a piece of crumpled paper, old in which only had a name written in a style different letter, only there reflected, exposing the moment everyone laughed at her for her work, but the teacher said: Art is complex, and seeing that everyone laughed with the work of his partner, can see that nobody understood the real meaning, since art is different for each person, each creates a different definition, so we must respect each of them understand that each person is a different world and everyone is art. I know you @MONTH1 be thinking those websites are dangerous is at, viris software can prevent danger. In conclusion social abilities are up with computers. ""Annabelle"" is a horror movie which i am going to watch this Saturday.I am wondering if i will be scared after the movie.The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was closed in a museum from Conecticut where she is visited  by a preist  who blesses her twice a month.John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife :a beautifull colection doll dressed in a wedding dress.Unfortunatelly,in a horribble night the couple""s house was invided by a satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them.The satanists invoced an eavel entity that is capabale of the worst things...Annabelle.After Mia gives birth to her doughter Lilly,Annabelel wants to kill her.Even the preist doesn's know how to help the unhappy familly.Everyone is terryfied and find out that a demon is attached by the doll.Idon't know the end of the story but i don;t think that is a happy one... This first reason is all actors shown their talent in this film directly and audience can follow their steps and the story certainly, this essential element which also makes a big success to the film. !"	2.5

"secondly these mode of transportation covers      as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routine who travelled by public transportation.as a consquence generally people avoid travelling by public transportation finally i can say that there are various mode of transporotation avaliable  to competition with public transportation. People don't get to see the out-side world because they are to ""busy"" on their computers, and use them to find things or play games that they can do just outside in the fresh air. Computers are and people spend to much time on them instead of having an outdoor experience, exercising, and talk and bonding with their family and friends. First of all, people don't enjoy nature as much as they enjoy their computers. After two years that his essay was released, he will understand that his essay was wrong moreover, Michael will want to apologise many people who read his essay thereby Michael now goes home, takes a cup of tea, goes to bed thus Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake Then the engineers call to other sector to ensure the doubt of Atlantis then the professional say that other was correct. When he was just about cursing the final line he got hurt and his mussels was dying and star to peel off a black matter, at that point the guys in suit thought that he won’t be able to cross the line , but when they saw that he kept running, they freeze the time and run after him, he stopped for a moment but then , he start running again and when he cross the line he woke up in a red somber fluid, he was wiped out from the matrix, he opened his eyes and saw a flying robot, suddenly he was on a wood wheelchair and they said that he would never be able to walk again , besides that, he stands up and tried to walk again. Some @MONTH1 say you can enjoy nature and explore new places online, and yes you wouldn't you want to do it first-hand? Frist of all at home we recycle plastics, glasses, papers and cartons, oils, clothes, batteries, organics in an especial composting bank where we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials and finally all the other things are sends to an especial tip where we avoid to drop it anywhere. You have to be their and explore it by yourself. first my favorite sport is futboll and i like for many reasons for example while you are watching a match you´re going to feel exited and entretaining besides that fubol has the best fotboll player than ever who is leo mesy he's the best and he s able to awesome stuff when he´s playing. about my rest of family , as I said before they are just a relatives , but even if they are not friends almost ,but I do love them to much ,first one is my aunt ,the dead one ,and the other who still alive ,but i don't feel that felling of love towards my uncle , I do love him ,but he is just my uncle no more . Fresh air is good for you, you. Nowadays,an increasing number of people are concerned about the phenomenon that armland ,forest and wetland is disappearing for some long-term human activities,for instant housing and transport networks is builded by destroying the balance of environment. Family is the most important thing in your life, and as you get older, the time you have with your family get less and less. You also @MONTH1 see you friends in school or at work everyday but you don't really get to sit and ""catch up"" with each other. In addition, stress is a clear disadvantage of compete because competitiors are trying to win and this can frustrates.But, some people do not think this like this and take it more simply Finally, I think that to compete in sports has some benefits and disadvantages, but when is controlated there are some benefits that help you to whole you life. It's a better experience and you made many more moments. Just going out far which or even going on a run can give you time with your loved ones.

A @CAPS1 that has no books to read or magazines to inform you upon the latest gossip and fashion? Maintaing cars are expensive.Public transport you do not need to worry about any petrol filling, checking tyre pressures, getting tired after driving long journey.In future cutting down public transport affects many of the people.Elderly people wont able to drive always depends on public transport.If public transport stop services people who are not able to drive will  affect a lot. Yesterday ,I had a wonderful day  .In the morning I went to a Galician basketball training with a coach of Spanish selection ,when  finished went to my parents to a hotel to eat and stay with some friends , after the food meet with  friend´s of my parents and went to a theme park and we rode to a rollers coaster, it was very exciting and we ate a chocolate ice cream, it was delicious .At night we went to a match  of Spanish basketball league, Obradoiro versus Real Madrid and that match won the team of Real Madrid and then I went home to sleep. If the @CAPS1 is left without certain materials there will be no creativity. Everyone will be forced to think the same thoughts if they can't learn about other thoughts that are protrayed to be offensive.

It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. If a certain topic is banned for being discovered as a offensive topic then this will result in the thought being banned. If you can't read or watch a topic you shouldn't be able to think or talk of the topic either because you will offend someone. It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. Eventually everyone will be wearing the same clothes, eating the same food, and thinking the same thoughts. I do not believe that certain materials should be exterminated from the shelves if they are found offensive.

"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that two out of three @CAPS2 own a computer? Mohammed is a kindly prophet born in small city called mekka and travelled to another city closed to mekka called almadina cause the people of mekka were very aggressive and they not accepted the new Invitation for the new religio Mohammed came back to his town mekka after that and forgave the people of mekka whose abused him They allow people to communicate with eachother, learn, and teach hand-eye coordination and other good things for school.. Computers are a very useful and beneficial part of society. hello  my name is Mustafa I am 23 years old and I am Student in collage I search for job but I don't find a job I wish that my country become a great country and better and I wish to married who I love her  thank you To combat the distriction of enviornment,this is a serious problem throughout the world.Nowadays ,many trees and grasses are damaged in many countries,lots of building are constricated.And people should pay attention to this problem and try to slove it. This allows people no matter how far to talk to each other and stay in touch. With my webcam I am able to keep in touch with my cousins in @LOCATION1. Another way of communication is through email. Nevertheless travel by car is easier for commute for example, because they can choose a personal timetable without a terrible discomfort of buses; in addiction there is a fair chance that by the end of this century dwellers will stop travelling by public transport, in special way if the government have invested his money in green energy and we could discover a new green car, which in turn revolutionary our life. It is very fast and easy allowing people to talk to each other more and communicate. For other hand, People make other inventions for improving the world and reduce pollution, for example, In this time we have created electric cars or organic food, these things are very useful in future, because we will need to reduce pollution. In order to reuse, I convert all thing reusable,for example,plastic bottle as a plant pot; glass bottle as a food container;I bring my reusable shopping bag and refuse to use a shopping plastic if a salemen offer me to bring. Most of the labours will probably have been represented by machinery, the people who is lack of academic might be very hard to get a job, the knowledge might be demand if the people live in the future. Computers are very helpful for communication along with @CAPS6. Computers are an advancement that could help people learn more about anything. For instace, they could learn about foreigh plaus. All they would have to do is go to the internet, type what they were @CAPS5 for, and it would come up on the screen. It would allow people to learn about places all over the world. Also, people can see pictures on the computer. Pass some years  of the university and he know a girl called Kate and he get loved on here and she get loved in him. However, the computer does not just show places. People could also see animals, other people, the environments, and anything else they want to learn about. MOTASSEM is nice and lovely fiance he love his job as he is Patient will dong has jop .he is  a  hard worker he has amazing laughs     .When you started  talk with him you will be inspire by his knowledge and his way of talk he have the talent to Convinces  thought. Last month,my friend came to Korea and visited me.In the morning We went to Ocean Park ,we saw dolphin,cat, horse and many animals .In the afternoon we went to play rollar coatser,I screamed on top of voice and called for help .Actually I hate playing rollar coster .We played mind train ,punch and a lot of games .At the end of the day I was just like running out of gas ,because I was too tired to walk any further. Above all,the design is the most previous way we should know,which is considered with the background color and artwork.Secondly,we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinsts.And the we need printing and inspection.Eventually,the most essential part comes out,we need significate the quality of the sheets.If it's good,packing and distributin whereas the others shoulde be distroyed as well. If you ask anyone in school, they will tell you that computers are a very useful tool. Cricket has become a part of me since when I was a kid.Its very interesting sport.Cricket brings a passion on me whenever and wherever its possible I find out a way to start the game.I also watch cricket patiently.Its known as the gentleman's game.The best part of this game is batting whether someone knows or not he first prefer to bat.Batting has its own cherish.So, I also prefer to bat and hitting hard rather than bowling. Students can type a project or paper on the computer faster and easier. But in some day tow guise with quad bike and they saw some thing wrong they sad what's that , they sow dead body , they skared and run to ther camp . Plus, computers teach students hand-eye coordination. By typing or even just clicking the mouse, students are bettering their coordination. This is due to the fast while they are @CAPS5 at the screen and typing or clicking, they have a sense of direction and know what to hit or where to put their hands without even @CAPS5. I am also committed to preparing monthly reports for newspaper supplement “The Voice of Women” which issued by the WATC “Women's Affairs Technical Committee , and I have the cooperation with the Environment and Development the magazine which issued by Center for development work ""Maan"", annd other web sites and news and media organizations. As i didn’t found nothing, i went to the place he live at and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he care about so as i continued to go to his houes i notice he will alays go to tehe same house so i decidec to follow him to the house and i foun out he was dating a girl she might be his girlfrien so i finally gota an idea, i would drive him crazy just as he did with me, that way she will think he had problems on his mind and left him, but son i thougt about it again and realized that if i did that she will try to help him and they will be more united,  so i decided to drive them both crazy almost at the border of death,  jus as he did with me! So they make a plan to display all... The next day when they were about to start filming they ere non ants there so they search for them, but they can't find them... In that moment the ants and Penny attack them in their backs, making them to leave the place. Computers play a big role in society today. Does why, is easy to believe that if things continue with this rhythm and transforming everything, in a closer future of 50 years everything is gonna be completely knew and different.

"In a study conducted by @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are spending more that @NUM3 hours a day on the computer. ""@CAPS1 computers became so popular here has been an increase in social problems, health issues and pollution,"" says @PERSON1. The social networks such as: Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,Google plus... are connecting  us to more and more friends, companies, public figures, books, films, social organizations...we are really have many things to see, to think, to ""like"", to ""comment"" and a dozen of stuffs that we can make an action to interactive with others...so may it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves, to take care our healthy. I strongly believe that these computers are badly affecting us. people that they play in this categorie are fameous althoug you can see them on tv.if you want to be a big football player you must to practise more time and yoor life should to be healthy. Imagine, sitting outside under the brilliant fall sun as leaves of red, yellow, and green dance with the wind. How will anyone see the beautiful sights of the outside world if their eyes are glued to the computer screen? Eight out of ten @CAPS2 surveyed by the national nature @CAPS3 admit to not going outside on sunny days but instead play on the computer. I will tell you a review of a thriller, the thriller is Hunger games it is about some capitals and people are choised and play on a game, you have to kill persons for they don't kill you, is a movie that have suspense because you want to know ho survey, in the movie someone love someone and protect each others, is very cute but on the 3 movies they are bad moments with the family, capitals, Friends, etc. Dr @PERSON2. How is our country supposed to be clean if people want even turn off the computer the @NUM4 hour a day and see the world? There are many sports grounds for example tennis cort,football grounds and play equipment for child so I think my town takes care of environment that makes everyone will be able to best condition in both mind and body long time. Second, computers take up so much time that people are with their families. I used to think that talking with someone. When anyone miss to pass the ball or miss scored a goal we shouting on his face are you crazy how you missed this goal ! I remember meeting the girl. This is due to Lima in the beginning  has not had a pant to desing its public road s and highways, and it only has been improvising to build their way without any criteria to transport its population. Seventy-nine percent of families split up due to social problems. All smart, intelligent people talks about families or just car and around, these sucessful people know the key to happiness is communication and are working to help get rid of computers. Lastly, more time on computers means less exercise. Secondly, studying in university, I have to live far from house which make me be homesick, sad, and worried I have to live in dormitory with many strange friends, they ‘re very noisy and I have to share my room with my roommates. There has been a @PERCENT1 increase in a obesity in children from @DATE1 when computers weren't big. I think in the future don't exist public transport because we will drive their car.When you drive your own transport ,a car for example, you going to from a specificlly place but in a bus you go to the bus stop and no to your house or school, work... It is better from the people be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person. In conclusion computers take away some important things line exercise. Come on now-can't we agree that computers have a negative offers ? My advice of finding work, is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work.But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase. It will be the best choice you ever make."	2.5

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has been brought to my attention that some people feel that computers are bad for us. Some people say that they are a distraction to our physicaland mental health. Although I can see how some people would think this, I believe that computers are a good benifit to all society. I believe this because computers can help people learn, stay intach with friends or family that live faraway, and stay orginized. Nowadays, the transportation become more prefect,and the people'life become more convenient.Althought this change lend the life of people efficient,the problem should not be ignored.It would really be helpful if the government make tighter resrictions,in today's world ,lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission, they are destroyed the forest,farmland and wetland,charging waster water and emitting greenhouse gas,it lead to a serious enviorment problem.So the government should oversee this companies ,and if companies do not obey the rules or laws ,it will be fined and closed. Simply by visiting the @ORGANIZATION2 homepage, you automaticly see the news feeds of things happening around the world. Other times people go online diliberatly to learn. But why public transport have no future to stand and keep going?, that's because of the people that changing their mind, they start like having their own way to travel, Privacy also an important reason, people need to have a private means of transportation. Simply by searching equadore many choices will pop up you climate, sesonal weather, hotel options, and other farts. One of the example is television, in the past we use it only for watching news and movie, but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t, now television has others function. Then ,the notes will be prepared with metal plates .After that ,printing ,the notes will be printred in colour on  both sides with special ink and it will images sightly raised . This is because some students like calm quietness or own house the distractions of sitting in class. Friends could be a big distraction in class, but how can you stay intouch with your friends if they moved away? I remember in second grade my bestfriend, @LOCATION2, move away. I was so sad. I badey ever talked to her, but then one day our parents set us up on a vidio chat! secondly these mode of transportation covers      as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routine who travelled by public transportation.as a consquence generally people avoid travelling by public transportation finally i can say that there are various mode of transporotation avaliable  to competition with public transportation. This was great, and I though about how many people could use this to talk to relatives or friends. But today, Things are getting change and technology marked a significant role in our life, Automobile segment increased its vertical and having a car becomes a need from luxory. By writing a message and sending @CAPS1 can make staying in touch so easey, and your personal wants can chat and emails are a easey thing to send world wide. Finally, Taiwan still suffers economic slump, but we have so many businesses likes to innovate, market their product, customers likes to buy it.

Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath...deep one and started to dive . My computer keeps me orginiced because I could never loose my work. File save, is an idiot proof way to keep all your files in a safe place. The sport is very importatnt of our body it has many benefits to emprove our selves and give us self confedant so we should practice any sport we love because it can change our mind to the better. The mas was armed try to steal the backpack.But he not be fixed that the man was a camera in his head and hi action was filmed. Also, I myself am a much faster typer than I am writer so my work is a lot needey on the computer. After 4 days all came with spectacular pictures, portraits of people, large sculptures, to a student, her name was Sandra, she arrived with a piece of crumpled paper, old in which only had a name written in a style different letter, only there reflected, exposing the moment everyone laughed at her for her work, but the teacher said: Art is complex, and seeing that everyone laughed with the work of his partner, can see that nobody understood the real meaning, since art is different for each person, each creates a different definition, so we must respect each of them understand that each person is a different world and everyone is art. Many people, could agree with me. Secondly,Closed trash bins provided to the people in order to collect the waste and recycling.People come forward and utilising this bin effectively instead of throwing away.As a result of this town looks clean compare to previous decades."	2.5
353	"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"the first day we went to Taormina and Giardini Naxos, the day after we visited Siracusa, the third day Agrigento and The valley of the temples and the last day we saw Marsala and Trapani. yes, i agree, if you planed the travelling for a long distation and for a long time you would prefer to do it on car, couse firstly you;ll spend less time, you travelling will be comfortable, you'll have a possibility to stop every where and for a long time, as you need. We learn from our best friends and share experiences with each other. No matter the distance, their friendship is always there for you, even if you are thousands of miles apart or just a few houses away. The laughter between two best friends is an element that bonds them for life, because when two friends truly laugh together, they will always have a small moment in their lives intertwined for as long as they live. Otherwise the public transport don't pollute but the car pollute so for us travelling by car is better than travellng by public transport but for the atmosphere is better travelling by  public transport than travelling by car We were there for each other from learning how to jump rope at school through broken bones, school-girl drama, crushes, boyfriends, heartbreaks, weddings and funerals. We helped each other get through everything from hard classes to family pets dying. We offered advice and brought hot chocolate, but this is only the beginning of our friendship. After the problems were solved, we learned how to laugh at our mistakes and move on. Together, we have gotten past slip-ups in what we say, to slipping on the floor. the first day we went to Taormina and Giardini Naxos, the day after we visited Siracusa, the third day Agrigento and The valley of the temples and the last day we saw Marsala and Trapani. @PERSON1 and I know that, no matter what situation arises, we will always be there for each other, because we have the each others backs. @PERSON1 can make a joke out of any occasion. She is one of those friends that can make you smile just by seeing her face or hearing her voice. Most of the best moments in my life have usually involved @PERSON1 in some way. my father  my father name is Zaheer arat.he is very loving and caring.they gives us all the facilities one should have and dream of these things.he provides all the facilities to us of internet and books so that we can learn better and can be good students and get good marks in the examination.he always encouraged us and said don't afraid of anything because you are braver than anything else.my brothers and me proud of my father.he is very hard working and brave.he has the smiley face.he always tries to laugh other people with their jokes.he always listens to us what we want.he never ever ignore us. @PERSON1 can always crack me up with her perfect imitations of anyone, no matter how bad of a mood I am in. On the top of the steps is the inspectation by hands, that is to say, they should be separated into well-qualified ones,which are to be cut into bank notes,and delivered to the banks and the bad ones which can't be utilited are fired definitely at the last stage. We laugh over lines from our favorite movies and write down the funniest moments. We have shared so many memories together that we laugh over everything from driving around town and listening to music to being followed by the kiosk workers at the mall. pain and gain  This movie is bases quote on quote on a ""true story"" buts obviously director michael bay know for the transformers franchise puts a lot of hollywood into this movie, its about a bodybuilder named daniel lugo who decides to kidnap a rich guy and make him sign away all of his properties, which obviously its not a great plan that backfires on him, and eventualy police get him. We laughed about everything from building sets to mistakes on stage. We had to open and close curtains in the dark, while wearing full black. I stubbed every single one of my toes that week while rolling the sets on and off stage. My hair was impossible to miss from the audience's point of view, even though I kept cramming it under a black ski hat. @PERSON1 would always have a problem opening one of the curtains that would get stuck when it was halfway open. She had to frantically tug on the rope even thought it kept getting caught in the pulley. I would laugh at her mistakes and she would laugh at mine. We both had a lot of fun watching the audience, director, and actors all at the same time. @PERSON1 and I got to stand in the back and watch all of the actors mistakes, giggling silently with each other. he said kindly:""I buy you a present,open it,Tom"" Tom opened the big bag,Oh!This is a big surprise,there was a football in it,which he always wanted to buy there were some words goal!keep doing! Now whenever we mention any word or line from that play, we both start cracking up and remembering the entire weekend. To our relief,she was saved and when we went to granny room,we saw smile on her face.We were also happy,but in Michael head came a lot of things.He knew that if we escape at that moment when the granny was at the ground,she would most probably die.Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years In this shopping center I bought new blue skirt.After that we went our favorite art-cafe.We like it because cafe has beautiful design and tasty food .After that we went to walk on embankment.It is all our plan.Hope to hear from you soon! Just one key expression or a twinkle in our eyes can crack the other up. Most other people around us probably would not even notice the small crinkle in the corner of our eyes or a slight smile. Those are the best codes ever imagined, because only the person that it is meant for could figure it out. The messages shared through the eyes a best friend can silently bring up subjects never spoken about and make us laugh. Abortion is an immoral act that people make as everyone has a chance to survive and nobody has the right to decide for anyone life.Abortion has to be taken seriously in order to avoid these immoral action as these fetus are being deprive of their right since they have already a life.People had to be sensitize about abortion in order to decrease the number of women being abort.Furthermore,abortion is very dangerous and a great number of women had been death with this.Children has to be protected before and after life,it is why abortion has to be stop"	3

"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some people are debating whether advances in technology, such as computers, are benefitial to our daily life. Firstly,the city of Vancouver has a programme called go green Vancouver that it will protect the environment selecting the rubbish by containers at the same time there is a collaboration from the city hall of any district that it will provided a 3 containers for each house one for papers one for bottles y the last one for rubbish materials. For one, information and knowledge are at your fingertips. It takes merely seconds to know anything you want or need to. Email, @CAPS2, @CAPS1, etc. can be labeled as wasteful or dangerous. New friends can be made everyday. Lastly, there can be limits set so no more worrying about to much time spent on the computers. One of the reasons computers can be benefitial to our daily life is what it can give us. ""Annabelle"" is a horror movie which i am going to watch this Saturday.I am wondering if i will be scared after the movie.The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was closed in a museum from Conecticut where she is visited  by a preist  who blesses her twice a month.John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife :a beautifull colection doll dressed in a wedding dress.Unfortunatelly,in a horribble night the couple""s house was invided by a satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them.The satanists invoced an eavel entity that is capabale of the worst things...Annabelle.After Mia gives birth to her doughter Lilly,Annabelel wants to kill her.Even the preist doesn's know how to help the unhappy familly.Everyone is terryfied and find out that a demon is attached by the doll.Idon't know the end of the story but i don;t think that is a happy one... If you want we could go to the capital city of my country, we will go by the car because the car is cheaper than the bus or train, we could eat in the famous restaurant of the city or we could go to the cinema also if you want I could visit the medieval wall. Homework, school projects, and even work need information that isn't found anywhere else. The library is a great place to find what you're looking for, but if you're in a hurry and need what you're looking for quick, there is the online encyclopedia, world book, etc.Technology is becoming a huge part of our life today, many opinions are up in the air about it. If, there's one thing everyone can agree on, it's fast and can make daily tasks easier. Ordering clothes, books, movies, tickets for trips and more all can be done online. That's not all the computer has to offer. Three words that describe me really good is: happy funny and sometimes bothersome A thing that i would like that people knew is that its not a good idea that wake me when im sleeping. They @MONTH1 live on the other side of the state, country, even world! @CAPS2, @CAPS1, email, etc. can allow you to connect with anybody around the world at anytime. E-mail has been around longer than other websites like @CAPS2 and myspce which allow you to keep daily tabs on them. @CAPS1 or ichat allows you to instantely talk to anybody that you want. These websites can't replace being together in person, but it can help keep in touch for the meanwhile. So if you want to work in Egypt you must have a complete information about the job (location ,salary,incentives, Allowances , work environment,position titles , company type,policy ,mission,vision)                                                                                               With best Wishes                                                                                                Sameh Sabbagh he jump from his bed to the street and walk to his way to see what he did every morning.when he walk after the stranger man  he notice that he stopped in every trash in the street to take a look and go to the next one, and guess what he saw Michael and run away also Michael was afraid. To sum it up I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convinient.Public future unless they have project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger. then when I have time and I see a senior citizen in the street  introducing their scraps bag in an wrong bank I explain them who they have to recycle and who important it is for our environment carefully recycle it A certain amount of time can be plugged in. What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player ,i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families, Lastly , workshops about conservation of environment to increase environmental awareness among people to encourage them to take care of their city , and how they can recycle some rubbish to beneficial objects to exploit it at home . Many different opinions about whether computers belong in our life have been shared. my favourite sport is swimming , it makes me feeling comfortable and left me in a good mood , i go to swim twice a week , and my advice to anyone want to start to enjoy every moment of it They allow you information at the touch of your fingers, access to friends/family, plus there's time limits. In this day/age, the computer is something we can't live without."	3

Secondly, if you use the car, you haven't wait much time ti catch the bus or the train, and maybe you can arrive later at your job, for this situation. @PERSON2 says about the internet site @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS4 sure @PERSON2 and a lot of others love their computers. Firstly it is clear that more house and transport networks is convenient for our people,what is knowed to us is that the population growth is a big problems,which is needed for more palce to living.And builing more transport networks is also benifit for us,for example ,the high-speed rail can be shorteded our time in traveling.while the animal may not welcome to it, @PERCENT1 of couples today say they met online via twitter, facebook, myspace or aol. But lot of peoples saying that, the zoo can protected endagered spices against illegal poachers. You cand find peolple just like you online and after a while the two of you are friends. I have some of my best friends online through a mutual friend's page and it's a sucessful friendship today. Even schools took education to the web, with all books from a class avalible at home online. Students can even check grades online now and recieve comment from teachers. So now students are pushed to use the web at home and at school. I don´t have friends who like swimming, almost like football or similar teams sports, and always I go alone it isn´t boring for me furthermore, I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I haven´t wait anybody. Personaly I spend about an hour or two on the web chating, studying, watching tv. After I might go walk or play my @CAPS5 but i'll still conected to the web because the @CAPS5 picks up on wi-fi connections. But why public transport have no future to stand and keep going?, that's because of the people that changing their mind, they start like having their own way to travel, Privacy also an important reason, people need to have a private means of transportation.

"Imagine walking out of your home and you see right down the street a giant bonfire, right in the open. this country are many interesting pLaces to visit,if you wantto have adventure you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza.If you want to have fun you may go to parque de la Costa there are many interesting rolercoasters.And if you want to go the best museum of art in Argentina you should go to malba. The men then toss them into the raging inferno and you seem them become incinerated, lost forever. Although the public transport is slow but it also do not take a long time of people to reach their destination because public transport nowadays are developed more fast and enough. We should not let censorship of our libraries take place since it violates a constitutional right, will gradually make our society more and more ignorant, and will let this nation slide from a democratic nation to one where the beliefs and ideals of the people are controlled by a small group of people. Letting censorship of our libraries take place will violate a basic constitutional right, plain and simple. In the @ORGANIZATION1 it clearly says that there will be freedom of the press. By tossing out certain literary works this right will be thrown to the side and by violating one constitutional right, what will come next? Will our freedom of speech be negated, or our freedom to assemble? As citizens of the @LOCATION1 we can not let this happen to our great nation. In conclusion, for me it is a lie that the public transportation has no future, however, they have to make improvements to this like the use of better ways of fuel or energy, one way is using renovable sources of energy such as solar, haeolic (wind) or hidraulic(water),Also there are biodisel, and gasoline extracted from seaweed.And the public transportation will be more important in a few years than now. For example take @PERSON1's theory of evolution, a very sensitive subject among people of the @CAPS1 faith. In these diagrams below,the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly.The first step,the bank notes should be desinged concidering some constructions,like background color,artwork and security issues,After it was prepared,skilled machinists would make preparaation of metal plates in the second step.Then,sheets of bank notes would be printed by 50 bank notes per sheet,which have colour imagines on both sides in special ink.After printing well,these sheets would be manually inspected closely.It was the most important step during the whole processing.And then,some  sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets  which would be cut into and separated into equal ones andpacked and depatched to where they are demanded. There are company so much,they make our life polluted.To take care of the environment,each of us has to do anything such as propaganda to the people in the country,...about my village, we use banana leaf stead of nilon, garbage desposal sensibly...and so on. This process involves five main stages.First,it should take some considerations in design,including background colour,artwork,security issues.Next,skilled machinists is prepared ,in which there are metal plates.Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet).Subsequently, the technical must be used specially for distinction,for example the colour printed on both sides,Special ink is used and imges slightly raised.After this,printed sheets will be inspected carefully.According to the quality of sheets,it will be two results.if the quality is good or the bank notes is partially damaged which can be used,it would cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and disoatched.while those bad sheets will be securely destroyed. We were all excited, those from Lala Band minunate.Their voices have positive vibration through their musical and give you a good feeling.On the scene moves very well and know how to take pleasure to the public.I am feeling wonderful and my promise is that when going to have a special occasion to go to a concert supported by Lala Band, you will be with me.As like this in all my heart.I hope as those recounted by me in this mail and you feel a slight vibration from the concert. This is exactly what we would be doing if we allowed censorship of our libraries to take place. The censoring of the libraries would be controlled by a relatively small group of people which means that the censoring would be controlled by that same people's beliefs and ideals, and those same beliefs and ideals would thus  be forced upon the people, shaping the beliefs and ideals of the masses to those select few. In conclusion, letting censorship take place in our public libraries will dismantle the basic structure of our society by violating a constitutional right, making our society gradually become more and more ignorant, and letting the beliefs and ideals of our people rest in the hands of a select few. This is not what our @CAPS3 @CAPS4 envisioned @LOCATION2 to become and they were right. Letting censorship exist in our public libraries is simply wrong"	3

I think KAIST is a top university in Korea. It is famous for natural sciences and engineering. Comparing with other universities, KAIST's majors are all about science. University can only focus on science and invest on it. Her sons have a problem they cant see the natural light and one they Grace got up because her children were shouting and crying so she went to their bedroom and the courtins was not there so she go to the other room and the courtins also were not there so she stars getting nervous and more nervous so she go and talk to the servants, so she got very angry and she told them go out of my house and they did not care so she pick up a gun and the old lady returned her keys. Studying various field is also important. There are liberal arts classes, but it's lack than other universities. I want to enhance more. First, students can get common sense it many field. my favourite sport is swimming , it makes me feeling comfortable and left me in a good mood , i go to swim twice a week , and my advice to anyone want to start to enjoy every moment of it Even though it's basic knowledge, students use it through life. A little learning is much better than complete ignorance. Second, students can broaden their perspective. At KAIST, we only meet friends who are interested in science. One day I visit my friend Jimmy in New York city, he was a young man who was specialist on trains and tourism, he talked about how the citizens and the commuters move from one place to another, he told me that the grand central terminal was the largest terminal of the city,he show me were the landmarks of the big apple were so sightseers could go,he show me the city and we went to different parts first he took me to Columbus circle in the south west corner of central park were there were the most expensive apartments then we went to the lake were the jogging tracks that circle the lake area popular with early morning visitors,then we went to the museum of natural history that was located near the metropolitan museum of art then I got focal on the subway trains so we went to Grand central terminal when we arrive I was amazed to see many people going to work so he told me that it was conveniently for people to use the train because is very fastest and for the government it was a grat economic business then he told me that one of the characteristics of We can't meet people who are interested in music, language extra. after that the celebration was began and a lot of their friends have attended each one presented a gift for Sara , she was very delighted and suddenly the doorbell been rang  she was her old friend Tia . Third, it's helpful for science study. Yes,I think it also can educate.As times go by,technology is rapidly improving.More and more gadgets are invented such as televisions,smartphones and so on.There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly.Using will not only gain the entertainment but also get the knowledge.For instance,there are numerous program that we can choose.It is a good time to turn to the entertaining program,when we feel bored and gaze the wall all the day.Television provides educated varieties of channels as well.Discovery channel is posture-oriented model example to educate.We can learn how do the different animals feed on themselves.Above the statements can ensure a rich and abundant live. For example, psychology and brain science. Students can get knowledge from other field and graft on their study in future. They are called below: 1- chaharshanbeh soori 2- Norouz 3- sizdehbedar  chahrshanbeh soori:  It meaning Tuesday night of week and take place on last Tuesday night of the year .at this night people make a bonfire and jump over the fires and say to fire :I give you my sign of sickness(yellow color)and you give me your healthy sign (red color)and eat some special foods . Transportation is very important in cities,villages as well as in sub-lines.Many people has no vehicles,they only depends on public transport due to some reasons.Any way in some cases,car is very useful to reach the destination very fast.

The @CAPS5 used censorship not just during the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 as a brand of propaganda, but also during @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS11 under @CAPS12 guidance. Censorship is still in use in the @LOCATION1 today, as a way to 'protect the children'. The @ORGANIZATION1 tells the @CAPS2 public what we can and cannot watch on television and what we can and cannot listen to on the radio. Other organizations tell us what books we can and cannot read, what video games we can and cannot play, and what items we can and cannot buy.

As Katherine Paterson stated, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' If one person has the right to control what we buy, what we listen to, and what we see, then how come we don't have that right to control the same things for them? in my personal obinionits better to lern froma teacher not only dat you lern to pronounce the words correctly you also lern from a personwhat is in my opinion way better i thin k we spend enougth time on smart phones so i dont think its the best if we use them to lern as well. Eventually, all books, movies, magazines, music, and video games would be deemed offensive and inappropriate. Culture would slowly wither and die, and our lives would become drab and essentially useless, for lack of a better term. Invention of car has made people's lives easier.No more they have to solely depend on public transport.Though public transport are cheaper and one could get to know many companions ,increase network.But public transport has fixed schedule and on a rushing day not many can really enjoy their journey. Travelling by using any transport has become in one of our needs, in the past people used to take hours waiting for the public transport, now, we can afford any of those modern car at the agency. @PERSON2's work gave not only myself but a multitude of others insight into the life that @CAPS16 face in the changing landscape of their @CAPS7, and it certainly made me realize once again that I have a life rich in family, friends, and comfort. To begin with,the format of the bank notes needs to be designed,factors of considerations including the background colour,the artwork and the security issues.Sencondly,equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps.Thirdly,print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink,where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes. If you get to censor something you find offensive, then why don't I do the same thing? On the rest of the boring week, I was watching TV and suddenly my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet, so I decided to solve my Paris puzzles with my sister, which was less than a half solved for about one year but it had too much color in the sky so I didn't finished then a year ago. Last month,my friend came to Korea and visited me.In the morning We went to Ocean Park ,we saw dolphin,cat, horse and many animals .In the afternoon we went to play rollar coatser,I screamed on top of voice and called for help .Actually I hate playing rollar coster .We played mind train ,punch and a lot of games .At the end of the day I was just like running out of gas ,because I was too tired to walk any further. Where's the boundary between safety and and outright police state? But i know that a lot of joung people play tennis, i hope that the italian tennis player in a few years  will be very famous all over the world , then you don't wait you sign up in a tennis club and you will become a famous tennis player! Looking for any sport make you feel good and your brain be always refresh so that you  can begin your day with any sport to making fresh and after that you can make any job with refreshment mind. If censorship continues to grow and our libraries grow emptier and emptier, then I shall take death over liberty, for liberty with censorship is no liberty at all."	3
359	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"After 4 days all came with spectacular pictures, portraits of people, large sculptures, to a student, her name was Sandra, she arrived with a piece of crumpled paper, old in which only had a name written in a style different letter, only there reflected, exposing the moment everyone laughed at her for her work, but the teacher said: Art is complex, and seeing that everyone laughed with the work of his partner, can see that nobody understood the real meaning, since art is different for each person, each creates a different definition, so we must respect each of them understand that each person is a different world and everyone is art. This is because restaurants are places where people eat and most of the time, restaurants are closed areas. Smoking in closed areas would cause passive smokers to inhale as much pollutants as the active smoker. This would cause many health complications to a person. Maintaing cars are expensive.Public transport you do not need to worry about any petrol filling, checking tyre pressures, getting tired after driving long journey.In future cutting down public transport affects many of the people.Elderly people wont able to drive always depends on public transport.If public transport stop services people who are not able to drive will  affect a lot. The smoke released could also mean that the pollutant particles from the smoke could land up on the food in the restaurant. This is especially unhealthy for the person who consumes the food. It is all the more unhealthy for a person to eat in a confined area especially in restaurants. Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real. Restaurants are meant to be a place where people eat. In later time, society feel the need for change about iniquities that pass in the country and the Mexican Revolution explotes, the building is abandoned because the government and country dont have money for construction, to the point the building  metal estructure was used as weapons. Smoking should never be allowed in restaurants. Restaurants are places for people to eat and not smoke. Thus, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is very unsightly for a restaurant to have people smoking in it."	3

"After two years that his essay was released, he will understand that his essay was wrong moreover, Michael will want to apologise many people who read his essay thereby Michael now goes home, takes a cup of tea, goes to bed thus Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake Computers have now found a home in all most every buisness and home in @LOCATION1! You should knew about the prize for coming to the museum is very cheap ($15.00) for hour if you want to stay more time the prize increase in $10.00. But do they really consider both sides? Most likely not.. That is why I am here. Computers discourage exercise cut down the number @ORGANIZATION1 hours spent bonding with your family and are a waste @ORGANIZATION1 money and space. I believe computers should be re-examined and peole should stop depending on them so much. Which country has more than @NUM1 million fast food, restaurants currently functioning? Name the fatest country in the world. Who spends the most on unhealthy food? Egypt have more historical places such as pyramids is the one of empirical in the world and more people from around the wold come to see this pyramids the wold think how Egyptian people make this building from may be thousand year and still stand without change and more tourist come to take photo in the pyramids and study the stone and how the old Egyptian make this one without modern tools such as cranes and other modern machine more scientific teams come from all the world to study this building and make Egyptian science in more universities around the world to study how the air going inside this building and how it keep the food inside it and how this big stone takes out from far places and come for this place and how this building keep the body of the people after died and how this people leave inside the building and why this building like this and what the benefit of this building and how to make kike this building With over @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 the population being obese, something needs to be changed. According to studies done by the @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS2), @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people spend over @NUM2 hours a day on the computer. @ORGANIZATION1 those @PERCENT2, @PERCENT3 are over weight or obese. There is an obvious pattern. Exercising makes your muscles stronger, improves lung function and helps burn off unnessecary calories. People most definately need to get off the computer and exercise more. They might even like it. Spending time with your family can be great fun, as I recently discovered. Playing outdoors in team games brings out your competitive side, while board games challenge your mind. ""@CAPS3 who spend time with their family are @PERCENT4 more likely to do better in school,"" @CAPS4 @PERSON2 beyond. The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years There are some big shelves in center of market are divided to some different parts for kinds of goods like Dried fruit, nuts, flour, condiment, beans, grains, rice, etc. We need to turn @ORGANIZATION1 the computers, bring out the board games and keep @CAPS5 families together! ""In this economy, people cannot afford to waste money they don't have,"" @CAPS4 economist @PERSON1. And she is absolutely right! But what are @PERCENT5 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS6 wasting money on? No progress will happen without plan .Each one has a dream want to achieve it but first of all he need to put a plan and also cognitive one . The television is one of the most important AV media in the world.You can use it for many purposes, according  to your needs .There are a lot of channels in many roles,for instance , education , movies, songs ,sports,news and so on .The television is not only for entertainment but also for education .The television can entertain you through it's entertained channels, and the television can educate you through it's educational channels. In a whole year your paying @MONEY1 for something you don't need! I strongly believe that grammar is not the most important element to speak English, if you know grammar you only know certain rules to write, but I think that speaking is most important than writing, because when you go to anyplace in the world, you have to be prepared to talk and understand whatever they say to you; in this part you may notice that if you don't know vocabulary, you wouldn't unsderstand anything; but here is another topic, whether you understand or not, you have to notice the way that people talk to you, and try to realize what the person is trying to say. I used my car every day however few a few I started to take public transport for I can to save up money It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs.In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us.In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable. I certainly can't. I don’t like Narnia, but my favorite movie is probably 22 jump street, Lord of the rings, The tv-show: suits, The walking dead and maybe south park and family guy. @CAPS6 continue to gain weight, families fall apart and the economy collapses, all because @ORGANIZATION1 computers. my English   language is weak , I like to improve it which complete my post graduate study,      The reason for choosing this specifically English language  in September  future I would like to get to know more information about   an English language course ."	3

"How much of your free time daily to you spend on the computer? It is proven that people too to fifteen years old spend an average of @NUM1 - @NUM2 hours of their free time on a computer. the public transport  have no future , the crisis in 2008 ; has been down the oil prices .The oil is cheap now and new cars are more efficient and the goverment give stimolous for consumers. Too much time on the computer can interfere with physical activities, social time, and health issues. Computers have some good advantages here and there but mostly result in a negative effect. In this post decade, the percentage of exercise was gone down and computer bills have gone up. Americans have now spent most of the time web surfing, playing online games, and interacting with online chat rooms. Them they drink a cafe that give them many energy to construct faster the building, this café has a combination for the people can to live all the night. More people across the country have gained weight due to unhealthy food and no physical exercise. First, you should know is the weather, we have a very cold winter and a hot summer compared with the other countries in the middle east.If you want a city with sea you should choose any city in the west or east of Saudi Arabia.Riyadh is the capital City it's in the center of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.All the stores and malls are closed at mid night include the five prays breaks because we need to go for pray for work you need to know what the major you want to work in so I can help you to search for a good job matching you abilities. the development technology and Industry very fast , so the public transport no future , Must be Interesting the development transport Even fits the times. The that runs through @CAPS1 minds these days is 'why go out to talk to my friends, when I can talk them online?' I think the opposite. Get out of the gloomy house and go out to see my friends. With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of population,many agricultueal land,forest and ocesn had been used to destroyed to build more constructure and transport networks.From my own perspective,I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human  and animals. I check online for homework and in online shopping twenty minutes. Computers have a major effect on social lives like going out and being confident to meet new people. Lastly, health issues are raising rapidly! The reason we now have shows on @CAPS2 about people with weight and health problems can relate very much so back to the negative effect on people. Like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and the obese have shown how people gain weight. I think at least @PERCENT1 of these people spend to much time on the computer and not exercising. Eating @PERSON1's then goint home to play online games will definately increase health issues like weight, organs being unhealthy, muscles not functioning properly, and eye and brain damage from starring at a mouse and screen nonstop. Already public transport have been improvement and that makes comfortable to go on a trip,but I think that will be able to become good quality more and more,because so many people expectation. More environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of themthere is to that we have a center of care and, other more institutions, we also make environmental protection centers were people can visit and learn about this to sum up our village is very concentrated on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us My favorite sport is swimming.I engaged in swimming in nine years old.I had gotten first prize in a match.As a result,I think that I have some intellent on swimming.Since then,I meet my teacher in the pool.She teach me a lot of things,and be the most important figure in my life.She is a doctor,she told me that swimming will let my body more better.From then on,I fell my disease in decreasind and fell relax.Consequently,I need to swim usually."	3

"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 know, @CAPS2 people are starting to buy and own computers. Some experts say this is a bad thing and that we should spend more time outdoors. I disagree with this statement. First, computers help us with every day life. We check news on computers, some people even use their computers @CAPS1 a @CAPS3 and watch important shows. Second, a computer is a great way to comunicate. @CAPS10 its friends, family or even buisness, a computer is a excelent way of communication. One day many years ago in something place that a don't remember the name I woke up one morning more earlier than usual then I went to the kitchen and shout the name of my mother...but no one answered, and the first thing that I imagine is that they come to the town, quickly I went out to find they... But there was no one, absolutely no one, I'm scary, I yell and scream, look and look but I had no result  Suddenly I felt a warm hand that touched my shoulder and very slowly turn but the only thing I saw was a shadow that was holding a knife     I woke up and realised it had all been a bad dream You could write a paper on the computer for example read on to see how I support my reasons of why computers are helpful in peoples lives. In my life,many dreams have existed in my mind,which is sweet ,incredible,magical or horrible.However,one of dreams is keeping in my heart that I can't forget it forever. Well, @CAPS10 you had a computer, you could go online to the news website and read more. This is only one way a computer comes in handy in every day life, there are plenty more. Another way is @CAPS10 you don't own a @CAPS3, you could watch your favorite show on the computer. The answer is simply; this museum has many types of momias.In 1810 have been a war for indepedent of Mexico many people were fight with other people; for example: Miguel Hidalgo is considerate: ""The father of indepedent"" and he was to fight with monarquia Spanish. This is how computers come in handy in every day life. Sometimes the employers do strike and we clients do not known in time as a result we can not get on time to work,that is one of the disadvantages of using public transport. for carreer has 80% under 26 years old students are taken it, for the age over 49 years old only has 20%people are taken; but if you counper interest, it is totoly different; for under 26 years old have only 10%; but for over 49 years old it has 70%. He selected people to into in a chinese room, there was a computer in chinese language with diferente symbols, the american was a diferente behavior, they did not understand what was in the computer screen. Also computers can be good for business for large companies who need to comunicate out of the contry. I'm sure being a amazing newspaper company, you could use a way of easy comunication. finally, comunication with friends. These are @CAPS2 programs for this, @CAPS9 @CAPS1 facebook and myspace. I think that the  public  transport always going to be so important in our life  because  not all the people have the possibility to buy a car because the public transport is more expensive than a car, so for that reason the public transport in the future  could be exist, because public transport is a necesity in all the world not only for the money but too for the facility to take a bus or any other public transport finally, computers can be useful for schools and work. You can type a paper or news article on the computer. people ,espicially grnerator's owner, start using Canaopies, using very long pipes to get rid off as possible as they can from the polution. Also, @CAPS10 you need more info on something, you could look it up online. To our relief,she was saved and when we went to granny room,we saw smile on her face.We were also happy,but in Michael head came a lot of things.He knew that if we escape at that moment when the granny was at the ground,she would most probably die.Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Secondly, if you use the car, you haven't wait much time ti catch the bus or the train, and maybe you can arrive later at your job, for this situation. They help with everyday life, They are good for comunication. And last they help at school or work."	3

"he jump from his bed to the street and walk to his way to see what he did every morning.when he walk after the stranger man  he notice that he stopped in every trash in the street to take a look and go to the next one, and guess what he saw Michael and run away also Michael was afraid. Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach to people hand-eye cordination, and about places all over the world. Computers are also great for talking online to family and friends. Computers teach people hand-eye cordination. They help people to get familiar with looking at a screen and typing letters to form words. the first day we went to Taormina and Giardini Naxos, the day after we visited Siracusa, the third day Agrigento and The valley of the temples and the last day we saw Marsala and Trapani. It helps you to be able to look at the music and have your fingers know where to play. The computers helps with the piano because they both involve you looking at a screen, or music. While your fingers know what to do. So I think computers helps children and teens to have better hand-eye cordination. Computers are also very helpful to everyone because it is great for researching facts, or even just looking for somewhere to go on vacation. Say you just got home from school, and your teacher had assigned you to write a two page paper on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. ?XD)Cherry blossom is very beautiful but there are so many people.When we went to Sun Moon Lake by cable car,wind is so strong!I felt a little nervous though the scenery amazing.All in all,I stil have a memorable vacation. finally ,a public transport need more costs , because public transport (such a buses , train ) fees every year is increasing, and this problem we do not face it by private transport , Well if you have a computer, it is a great way to research a topic for school. Firstly, Django Unchained remembered us the hard life suffered by black people in the past, due to a great introduction without dialogues, where black people were unchained while they came back to be selling to an owner farm, it being matching with an amanzing soundtrack as identity Tarantino´s films. Computers give you the information that you need. Or if your planning a vacation in @LOCATION1, and don't know where to stay, then the internet will get you right there and give you great opptions. Another thing computers are great for is talking. To sum up, do sports is very important for teenagers to which the body is going to grow and do it regularly is commitment that we should take. online. People can travel through the city easily and safely.For instance Melbourn,the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area.Therefore people don't need to drive cars for travelling in the city.The last point is people go for long journey by public transport.Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive. Technology advance way to fast and it is really difficult guessing what kind of stuff or artefacts will be fifty years from now, but we can guess some ideas like flying cars, smartphones with the size of a small paper, laptops really thin like quarter of inch, clothes that clean itself or change the color and shape, healthier food, smarter electrodomestics. As I told you before because of the technology many things has become able in less time, and with the pass of the years this tend to increase. If I want to ever talk with my brother, it is great like he is in my home again. He sends me pictures of his college, friends, and any fun places that he goes. about my rest of family , as I said before they are just a relatives , but even if they are not friends almost ,but I do love them to much ,first one is my aunt ,the dead one ,and the other who still alive ,but i don't feel that felling of love towards my uncle , I do love him ,but he is just my uncle no more . Local newspaper please consider my opinion, I feel that computers benefit are society. In the end, large colleges admit largest number of students, so the student may do establishing friendships more from different nationalities, also it serves the community by graduating many students in various majors. Computers teach teens, and children excellent hand-eye cordination, and helps people like me to play the piano more smoothly and exact. Computers are also great for looking up facts for school when the library is not available. The internet also keeps me closer to my brother, whose in college, because we can chat and send pictures to each other. So please take my opinion into consideration. I am from spain so my foreign language is Spanish I start to study another language when I was a child, I started learning English because every one said that English is the future language, when I finished my school time I tried to study French but it was so difficult for me."	3
364	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"I agree to a limited extent that college students should have a part-time job. With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of population,many agricultueal land,forest and ocesn had been used to destroyed to build more constructure and transport networks.From my own perspective,I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human  and animals. In the future,people will go out of the Earth .Because of the damage,people on the ground can't survive.When they want to find foods,there will be nothing.Even of the grass can't alive on earth.Thought,but most people do not be the member of the team of alive.Cause of lots of damage,but they didn't Take responsibility.I wonder for sixteen years.And I don't know if they were change their mind in after the next fifty years. Having a part-time job provide learning experiences for the student that they otherwise would not experience in school. Work commitment, managing relationships with colleagues, time management, stress management and learning new skills are some of the things a student can gain if they were to have a part-time job. By joining the workforce earlier, the student may enjoy an easier transition from their role as a student to being part of the workforce upon graduation. In addition, working part-time also encourages the student to be financially independent by earning their own allowance. However, having a part-time job can be time consuming because of the weekly commitment. The time that could have been allocated to assignment research or exam revision could be significantly compromised because of the job requirements. In addition, the fatigue and lack of rest can lead to unproductivity when the student eventually settles down to finish their schoolwork. This may impact their results and harm their progress in their studies. After waiting an hour the time comes and bravely  with high confident level he walke to the office. I would like to say for anyone wants playing soccer to be very careful when he plays it because it may cause a lot of injures ,but in the same time it is very nice game. It is more important to enjoy their role as a student and to excel in it rather than to focus on getting a part-time job."	3
365	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Today personal vehicle become pride of the life , mean if a person is on there personal vehicle they are look as higher status in the society . Also, you may want to study that you want to learn more about even there are no exams. To begin with is design,we are able to considerate backgroud colour ,artwork,and security issues,and then,we are supposed to preparing mental plates,such as skilled and machinists. Which one do you prefer? I like to study alone and in quite environment. As we are fully depending on the indivitual generators ,that are causing multiple problems in he weather dueto it's smoke, the oil and gass left behind , in addition to sound offcourse that are themain source for the 18 countinous hours noise. this country are many interesting pLaces to visit,if you wantto have adventure you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza.If you want to have fun you may go to parque de la Costa there are many interesting rolercoasters.And if you want to go the best museum of art in Argentina you should go to malba. They argue that it is more helpful to study together. now days young people are influence towards the western culture so,they are getting more fashionable.youngster are interested to wear different stylish and colored clothes.they are happy with wearing different color clothes.they didn't want to wear our cultural dress such as sari,dhoti,choli and many more.they only like to wear shirt,pant skirt,t shirt and many more.youngster are influence by watching different programmes on  television. First, people who like to study together say that they can ask questions to each other so it makes them to understand the contents well. However, I think that the environment where they can talk together makes me more distractive. So, eventually, I will not focus on my study well when I am with my friends. Also, if the questions are things that I already know well, that would be just noise for me. When I am alone, I am fully focused on what I am studying and I can ask questions to my teacher or friends later. In addition to first, other people say that when they study in a group, it is going to motivate you to study hard. But what if their schedule is so fast or too slow? They are going to have schedule that every people in that study group need to follow. However, if you know too much more than them, or you have no idea what they are talking about, it would be really inefficient and you may be unmotivated even more. When you study on your own, you can adjust your schedule by your self so you don’t need to concern about such problems. You can make your best environment and schedules to study very efficiently. for example,using wind Energy or Solar Energy for electricity generation we will be used less fuel what is affected in emissions. However, when you study alone, you can make your own plan that is just right for you and not be distracted by anyone. You can be yourself and calm so that you can fully focus on your things to study. Then if you want we could go to the restaurant of the city later if you want we could fiand a job for three months, in my opinion a good job for three months I could be the waiter because the waiter get much money in the three months of the summer. Today personal vehicle become pride of the life , mean if a person is on there personal vehicle they are look as higher status in the society . Although healthy diet is quite expensive young people follow special diet in order to have better body shape or healthy life.Actually modern life affected on our palate changing .Instance some people who work majority of their waking houres prefer to use fast food more.Our commitments imposes us to forget ourselves and our healthy ."	3

People do not exercise enough, strain their eyes, and have less interaction with real people. One reason computers are having negative affect on people is because they no longer get enough exercise.

People can travel through the city easily and safely.For instance Melbourn,the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area.Therefore people don't need to drive cars for travelling in the city.The last point is people go for long journey by public transport.Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive. Scientests at the @CAPS7 lab in @LOCATION2 said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 regular computer users lost their vision within two years. For one, the show played on television may enlight us and give us some enlightenment.Teleplay are not just for fun,it can have a deep meaning,short story tells big deal,just like a useful book.So,why not television cannot educate us? We estimate @PERCENT2 of this next generation will be legally blind before age @NUM3."" @CAPS9, this new technology is harmful and very damaging to our vision. I have learned to  get control of myself when someone teaes me , and to be alert as well .Also ,it helps to look always slim and put me away from the ghost of obesity as well .People who want to start playing karate have to be patient . My uncle, @PERSON4, lives in @LOCATION3. We used to see each other from time to time and talk on the phone about once a week. The picture below illustrates how to make bank notes.First is to design the note,including background color,artwork and security issues.Second is to prepare mental plates as well as qulified machinists.Then is printing with special ink.When the one side is printed,raising the images slightly to make opposite to be colored.Last is the key step,inspection.It is of importance to inspect the printed sheets.If the sheet is good or partialy damaged,it can be packed and delivered by veichals after cutted in to separate notes.Otherwise ,the sheets and notes would be abandoned and destroyed in the fire. Another ones which were bad sheets and bad bank notes from damaged apparently,would be destroyed securely.This was the whole working process of the bank notes and it was consist of 7 steps. But he is not the only person with this issue. It is proven that @PERCENT3 of people who go into games like these or chatrooms lose interest in friends and family and their social skills worsen. Professor @PERSON2 had this to say about how this is affecting @CAPS5. ""Too many @CAPS5 are finding out about these sites and getting hooked. It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swimming and also when the age become older it will be more difficult to learn than the little . Environment is the sorrounding.there is no aleartness in our locality.they were busy in their own work.everyone were not focus or see what hapening in our place.they use to speak about how hot today is?but they dont know what makes this much hot.iam interest in planting tree and makes sorrounding clean.some people used to burn forest as if those forest is useless.man are greedy  because of all the thing  getting from the forest are free. In the end,if it is a good sheet,the porcedure is packaging and distribution,including cutting into separate bank notes,packing,dispatching.If it is a bad sheet,the porcedure is disposal    --bad sheetsand bank notes should be securely destroyed. Computers will bring nothing but grief to humanity. Another example of why lives are gonna changed completely in 50 years is because also that connection between others cultures make People concern more about her own health, the expectations of life and the way they want to live it, because everyday will be easier to see how much are we hearting the earth so we will see faster the impacts that this brings to our life. They cause us to stop exercising and gain weight, permanently damage our eyes, and deny us of the proper socialization that all people need to be happy and health. Is this @CAPS12 you want for your self and generations to come?"""	3
367	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"My town do much efforts to care of environment,they put many pins in the streets to keep it clean also they prevent private drivinig at many days to keep air clean ,they seed trees to absorb co2 and release o2 ,they build factories away from the house of population to prevent respiratory diseases which is a result of air pollution from factories,so not only my country it self but also the individuals follow a proper way to keep environment clean. There are a few people are using puplic transport, like students and someone had low income.in my veiw, i can say might be the puplictransport going to e close because nobody is going to beclose !, @CAPS1 I didn't where did you find out, on the computer. Secondly,tourism,especially in developed countries,has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view.There are countries,such as Greece or Bulgaria,in which the econmoy relies merely on tourism.If tourism influences the econmy,it thereby influnces the environment,and if it influences the environment it influences the transport.How?people become more careful at their historcal sites,this way preserving them;Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale:At a small scale,in cities, in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently.At a large scale,people can now travel in almost any possible way:on land,on sea or air.Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations. I dont think that they should be concerned because the computer leave's people with an open mind and teach people new thing. So the computer does a lot for people, give's them the chance to learn new thing, a chance to chat with friends far away, and also expand your mind of travel. Computers can do a lot for a person's life of know'lleage. Just yesterday I found out that the human body can not survive without its liver. The computer also helped me with my strugle's in math, even though that's what the teacher is for she is not always their, like when I am home or away on vacation and I just want to remember so thing's in math. Its also help's people who want to know new launage's such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4. So you see a computer has a big affect on a person's life. Education has a crucial part in one society and it’s future and by improving the level of educations system, students can learn more effectively in their entire education life and their career but also their skills will be improved by this process. Apart from that you see new places and you have fun, you also lern others cultures, historicals facts, you also lern to respect others peoples and thirs costums. I want to turn to his hobbies, when he isn't working, he is riding on a bike, every evening he takes the bike and rides across some paths for more than forty kilometers by day, so he is very good rider and its quite strong to ride with him. I dont know why you experts are so concerned about computer taking away people's live's look what it has done for my family. I know that if one of you experts family member went away for a long time you would miss them and want to talk. Some people's love to video chat like people in the army because they get the chance to see their love one's. A two-way ticket to @LOCATION3, To see all those beautiful sight's and taste their wonderful food's look at that waterfall where is that, In @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1 now I have to go their. Most of the labours will probably have been represented by machinery, the people who is lack of academic might be very hard to get a job, the knowledge might be demand if the people live in the future. The computer is a wonderful thing. So dont be concerned about us and what we do on the computer. In conclusion dont listen to the experts they dont know what their talking about, for all we know they use the computer more than we do. The compute can touch you new thing, give you the chance to chat with family and friends far away, and open your mind on travel. So my idea is aii the coutries allthe people stop to use farmland,forest andwetlang to build houses grow more trees portect our world,our homestar!"	3
368	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Micheal was afraid he was waiting for sara to get out he went to the shore to look if she went from the other side but he found no footprints.his mother called him he went home and still thinking about sarah.it was night and ge was afraid ti get there again.he went to sleep .michael closed the door and knew at this moment he had made a mistake. Even though do not everyone doing that,so how much public office is care of environment is important and this town is care of that a lot.Every morning some peasons are coming park and cleaned that makes feel really thanksgratitude. this country are many interesting pLaces to visit,if you wantto have adventure you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza.If you want to have fun you may go to parque de la Costa there are many interesting rolercoasters.And if you want to go the best museum of art in Argentina you should go to malba. In my opinion, universities should require students to take classes in many subjects. First of all, studying many subjects can help students succeed in their fields. Knowledge from one subject might be helpful to understand some concepts in other subjects, and improve their skills. For example, Leonardo da Vinci was able to paint or make sculptures because he studied anatomy. Secondly, it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting a time in waiting a specific time to move or even waste a time in waiting a public transportation to reach all point it should get it , but in the other side when  you have your own transport or a private transport is get a right to choose time of trip or when you want to move or stay, and nowadays we cannot waste our time in taking public transport. In addition, students can mix up the knowledge and create their own field. In recent world, student setting up his or her own value is a key factor to success. Mixing up some subjects can be helpful. However, I think the tools should be improved, such as killer’s knife and actors'costumes, the knife looks like as brittle as a handicraft, I believe those are seconded-handed clothing. Studying various subjects can increase the chance to grab creative and interesting idea. Some argue that the effort needed to study multiplies if students study many subjects; however, it is not that much. Students should also invest a lot of time and effort to specialize in one subject. The amount of achievement students gain from equal amount of effort decreases as they study more and more. Studying multiple subjects with certain amount level is might be easier than being the best in one subject. To sum up, universities should require students to take classes in many subjects. It not only makes students to do well in their fields, but also create whole new field and be pioneers. In conclusion, we are assisting to a new tend in transport, every time, they are faster and more developer, with the latest technology included but at the oppossite case, we find also a contradiction, as we found an other trend for the tradictional transport which avoid the pollution in order to respect the Earth People complaint about how the information about different TV shows don't contribute in the process of learning, that's why many of This programmes are considered trash, because of the multiples shows such as realities, talk shows,or showbiz that hardly ever have a good message or something interesting for people."	3
369	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Firstly,the city of Vancouver has a programme called go green Vancouver that it will protect the environment selecting the rubbish by containers at the same time there is a collaboration from the city hall of any district that it will provided a 3 containers for each house one for papers one for bottles y the last one for rubbish materials. While it is definitely unfair to subject innocents to their second-hand smoke when they're trying to eat, it would also seem unfair to make it impossible for smokers who enjoy smoking before, during or after a meal to do so when eating out, especially in cases where it would not affect others. So,my favourite sport in the present time it is street workout.I have been exercising this sport already long time.I like to exercise on the street even in the season when the temperature outside below zero.Of course, in summer I like to exercise more than in winter but this don't stop me.I don't know myself why,but I almost every day go on the street in order to exercise.If  It is very coldly and windily outside,I don't worry about it and I'm exsercising at home.For those people, who want to start to exercise the street workout I'm advising to start with basic exerscises such as pull ups,push ups,dips and squats.That everything basic exercises and they will help you will do a good start up.After some time when you will be feeling that you are ready for more, you can start to study more difficult exercises. However, when it comes to bigger restaurants in particular, and those that are open-air, having a separate smoking section away from the rest of the restaurant patrons would not hurt anyone. Smokers would get to smoke, non-smokers would get a smoke-free environment, the restaurant would get more money, and everyone would be happy until they see the bill. Alternatively, there could be some restaurants that allow smoking while others ban it completely, and if non-smokers want to eat at a smoking-allowed restaurant, they'll just have to put up with the smoke as a compromise. Likewise, if a smoker wants to eat at a no-smoking-allowed restaurant, they'd also have to compromise by, well, not smoking. Diversity is key: having more options available to meet everyone's needs as best as possible, harming as few as possible in the process. As well, we have to promote that the people get jobs close their accommodation or get the accommodation close to the jobs, because we have too much pollution and we could reward the companies that hire staff close to the place of job, maybe in a circle of 4 kilometres, as well we could reward the people that turn their accommodation for live near to the job or for going  there by a bicycle."	3
370	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"I'm also a current college student and agree, the students who work even just a small part-time job at school are more motivated to get work done. Now, some students do live off of their own parents' money, which is fine if they are that fortunate. However, if they don't have a need to work, these students should be involved in a club or some type of other activity. There's a lot of responsibility that goes into running an organization on campus and it can help students remained grounded in a similar way that a regular, paying job would. so, i`m rely thinking left this sport.Everyday i get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends.i`m exercising more and more again to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world.i`m champion in my sport so, i`m seek to do all my effort to be the first one in the world.finally I did not find encourage of my family or my teachers. Holding down a part-time job during college is important for many different reasons. To begin with is design,we are able to considerate backgroud colour ,artwork,and security issues,and then,we are supposed to preparing mental plates,such as skilled and machinists. Having to focus on their studies is not a valid excuse, because there are many options available for part-time work, ranging from a few hours per week at an on-campus job to 20-30 hours per week in the service industry off campus. Personally I believe that those who are not participate any activity the teachers has them to encourage .Then only they also know how talented they are.Every student should attend and show their talent.After some ages we can not attend any this type of activity because we all are become old .So let do and enjoy your young age be happier. as a result of this consumer gets more benefit like lower faire, privacy, freedom and safe travelling.in addition many automobile company launcing new car with affordable price which insiost people to use more and more private vechile."	3

"It has been brought to my attention by some members of my community that the local library is planning to remove some materials such as our books, movies, and music. I've confronted them and they've made no such such effort as to amend the censorship that has already taken place. Tennis, tennis is not jsut a sport anyone can play but it's professional sport needs to more hard trainee and more time to be perfect in it, in first why I choose tennis?, seriously in 2003 this is my first time to watch the game on TV when I saw roger federer played I think he is the one that made me love this sport, due to it's professional motion in playing the ball, from this time I was interested in this game and watching all championship, so more time, time and time it was my favoirite sport.

Currently we have got more than six different types of banks in our streets but as far as I know it is not sufficient to meet the needs of the environment because nowadays we do produce a lot of different materials, all of them overproduced and we do only learn this education in our home in our childhood, accordingly I am one of the few worried teenagers in the world about it so I really do help the environments as far as I can. The capibilities of the human mind are limitless, but yet those who display it's functions are limited. Apart from that you see new places and you have fun, you also lern others cultures, historicals facts, you also lern to respect others peoples and thirs costums.

"Computers can be very useful to people. They can help contact friends and family from all over the world. You might need it for typing a paper for school or work, and you can use the internet. If you had a friend or family member move away, computers are an easy way to contact them. Technology advance way to fast and it is really difficult guessing what kind of stuff or artefacts will be fifty years from now, but we can guess some ideas like flying cars, smartphones with the size of a small paper, laptops really thin like quarter of inch, clothes that clean itself or change the color and shape, healthier food, smarter electrodomestics. Say your bestfriend moved out of the country you could email them or instant message them through computers. They die when John was too little to remember and he never know what happened so he went to all the parts for saw them even he walked and walked even at reverse but he never found them. However we the people have really important part of making it worse.Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh, clean and safe environment to their people.Recycling item can be a good step to start with clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking care by my city.Everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of province government.People is not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere. Imagine your at work or school and you were asked to write a five page essay. Do you really want to write it all? So,we can say that time is a double-edged sword , either help you or agonist you and in the popular say is right that say ""don't delay the work of this day to the next day"" because our works will accumulate then it become more hard to finish it .To ensure best use of time in our life ,we need to be punctual.punctuality avoid tension and trouble things ,finally even scientists have another vision about time, they discover that time is the fourst dimension by relative theory which exchange all concepts in science.

The internet gives information on anything possible. The internet also allowes students to take online schools or classes. When my oldest brother couldnt take @CAPS1 in high school when it was needed for college, he took an online @CAPS1 class at home. The internet also helps you find vacation spots when your going away from home what if you need a plane, train, boat ticket? In these diagrams below,the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly.The first step,the bank notes should be desinged concidering some constructions,like background color,artwork and security issues,After it was prepared,skilled machinists would make preparaation of metal plates in the second step.Then,sheets of bank notes would be printed by 50 bank notes per sheet,which have colour imagines on both sides in special ink.After printing well,these sheets would be manually inspected closely.It was the most important step during the whole processing.And then,some  sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets  which would be cut into and separated into equal ones andpacked and depatched to where they are demanded.

"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever been running late to a party and just realize you don't have the directions to the person's house? Nowadays in the cities developed there are many possibilities for public transport, like bus, train, subway, tram etc.these options it's more economical than the car, the problem of the car is that normally the car is occupied for a person, when the car is prepared for to carry four or five people. No progress will happen without plan .Each one has a dream want to achieve it but first of all he need to put a plan and also cognitive one . @CAPS1 you answered yes to at least one of these questions, there is a good chance you have used a computer in your lifetime. Computers have positive effects because they can give you quick and reliable @CAPS2 and the can be fun too. Firstly,hyrid cars only allowed to use during weekends as result of this most people not using there cars all the week. Have you ever been running late to a party and realize you do not have the direction's to the person's house? But in some day tow guise with quad bike and they saw some thing wrong they sad what's that , they sow dead body , they skared and run to ther camp . You can call up the person who probably wan't answer because they're @CAPS4 fun at their party, or you can go on the computer, type the person's address in and you will have your directions in seconds. And to day is necessary because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversation with their you need to now more than your foreign language, because in the rest of the world and particularly in Europe people now more than two language and that great. My mother always says to me, ""@CAPS1 you're @CAPS4 trouble finding @CAPS2, go on the computer,"" because she knows that there is all the @CAPS2 in books on the @CAPS3, and more. And it's just one click away, @CAPS4 sold that, the computer has positive effects on you because it gives you quick and reliable @CAPS2 In addition, computers have positive effects on you when you're trying to have fun. this country are many interesting pLaces to visit,if you wantto have adventure you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza.If you want to have fun you may go to parque de la Costa there are many interesting rolercoasters.And if you want to go the best museum of art in Argentina you should go to malba. @CAPS5 is used by teens and adults like, and for one reason only, to socialize with friends via computer. @CAPS1 you to another date and wait to see what your last friend's up the best thing to do would be to go on @CAPS5 and ask A @ORGANIZATION1 shows that in a family of five, four of them use the @CAPS3 to communicate and socialize with friends. Obviously, this is how computers have a positive effect. This experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister (I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money. Positive effects computers have - are that they are quick and reliable, and they are fun to use."	3

Would you simply pass the book by and go on searching for another, or would you be so taken by it that you demanded it be removed from the shelves immediately? But we don't have forgotten the cotamination by cars, We can use more the bicycle or public transportetion. It could be in a magazine in the do and don'ts section and you get slightly offended because you do something that is on the don't list or something about a specific race. Everyone, one time in their life, has been accidentally hurt by other peoples words and publishings in the world, but I do not think that is ever going to stop. All forms of media are for learning and entertainment purposees. All this will help people to live easily, but only to have more time to work, because the type of mind that reign that time will focus in the companies and make money and spend it, this is the reason why a lot of jobs are changing to a home office and the firms are giving more and more facilities to their employees to be more efficient. Every individual person has their own opinion and not everyone else is going to agree with that person. Just because one person does not agree with which hairstyle is hot right now doesn't mean that they should take it out of their magazines for all of their viewers. To me, that is just ridicolous. I would like to say for anyone wants playing soccer to be very careful when he plays it because it may cause a lot of injures ,but in the same time it is very nice game. Would you get offended? This town is located in the central zone of the Afghanistan with 4462(km²) space, and has more than seven Million populations, the economic and security situation is not suitable and these factors have directly effect in to the carefulness of environment. However, I have no agree with this statement because the public transport is needed for someone who are no have vehicle or economic downturn. We could not toss those books out anyways because without those history books at school we couldn't learn about our history. History is important to everyone and if we didn't learn about it and they did toss those books out how would we prevent history from repeating itself? When I was a young child my father used to hit my mother, so my mother takes offense to anything in the media that has to deal with abuse. There are many sports grounds for example tennis cort,football grounds and play equipment for child so I think my town takes care of environment that makes everyone will be able to best condition in both mind and body long time. The movie is about a girl who is abused by her mother and has her father's babies and she finally gets out of it and betters her and her childrens lives. Nevertheless the journalists stay all the time having a photo,all the time,when they eaten, drinking, happy, sad,how is your love life and with whoever stay, if stay with something important our what buy. Everyone is going to become offended in their life by the media. The media does not look at you as a whole, just as a population of people. When one person doesn't like something it doesn't mean it should be taken out or erased from history, it should just be rewritten or refilmed. The gym has many problems that we are gouing to explain : the first problem is that we don´t have enough aparatous for all of the students  the second problem is about that same aparatous are not working well because the school didn´t the manteinace long time ago For the first problem in my opinion , the school have to buy some others aparatus because there are not enough for all of the students For the second problem the solution for me is to hire someone to do the maintenance and say to all of the students to take care of the machines of the school I hope my proposal wiil be useful for you I look forward to hearing from you soon Sebastián Ferrari That is what I choose to do and I would say it is working out great."	3

Human beings know little about the universe, and curiosity about such unknowns are the driving force of our lives.

People all over the world cheered for human advancement into space and created their imagination like various sci-fi films and books. Nevertheless travel by car is easier for commute for example, because they can choose a personal timetable without a terrible discomfort of buses; in addiction there is a fair chance that by the end of this century dwellers will stop travelling by public transport, in special way if the government have invested his money in green energy and we could discover a new green car, which in turn revolutionary our life. Nevertheless, in my opinion, exploring space helps the entire human beings for three reasons. First of all, the Earth is increasingly losing its function as a home for life, and people needs a new place for humanity to live. The diabetes is the increasing  of the glucosa in the blood, The have two types, first the Diabetes Type 1 that is predent in childrens, pacient needs insuline every day, also this diabetes is caused by the destruction of the insuline realized by the person´s immuny siste. The Amazon forest, which is called Earth's lungs and produces fresh oxygen, has destroyed much of it and is still being cut down. Climate change is happening all over the world, and the climate that we've adapted to is changing, so it's a big mess in people's farming. I think that the  public  transport always going to be so important in our life  because  not all the people have the possibility to buy a car because the public transport is more expensive than a car, so for that reason the public transport in the future  could be exist, because public transport is a necesity in all the world not only for the money but too for the facility to take a bus or any other public transport For other hand, People make other inventions for improving the world and reduce pollution, for example, In this time we have created electric cars or organic food, these things are very useful in future, because we will need to reduce pollution. NASA plans to set up manned space bases on Mars and the moon, and humans will have a place of residence where they can escape in the event of a major disaster on Earth. Furthermore, exploring space is the greatest preparation to prevent the extinction of mankind. Just a few months ago, a big asteroid hit the Earth. There are hundreds of millions of asteroids in the universe. It is smaller than the Earth or the moon, and travels through space. The larger the planet, the greater its gravity, which in other words attracts objects around it. public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it is kind of becoming cheaper and also more safe but some  people prefer cars to extent do we agree with and what is our reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay  before about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was not even good facility to move from place to other and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans at the beginning the faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve it by the end nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and planes .some people prefer cars because the do like crowded places or because the find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places  to summaries it is different from some oneis opinion to another i predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end cars will disappear and will will no longer be used We need to develop enough technology to explore the universe to prevent this destruction of humanity. Some argue that space exploration costs too much, despite that opinion, it makes money. We the management of The Arch London Hotel received your mail and wishes to let you know that you should make known to us the position you desired to work in via return mail along with a scan copy of your signed contract of agreement to enable us make every necessary corrections.Thank you. In particular, computers were first developed for space exploration, and fabrics used in space suits brought about the development of clothing. So this has resulted in the same amount of money that we spent on space exploration. I played so good that everyone gave me congratulations but thats not all one of the best team of the world wanted too take me. It is also to prevent the earth from being devastated and to prevent mankind from becoming extinct. Firstly, staff and Personnel design the background colour , the artwork and the scuriity issues on the bank notes,which is also  done in process of other card,such as notes for supermarket.Then in the preparation process, skilled machinists prepare of metal plates for printing.After that sheets of bank notes are printed,there are differences and specials for it, it use special ink ,and print colors on both side,images are slightly rised."	3
376	Do violent video games affect kids in a negative way? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"    In history, science and technology improved a lot than past for comfortable life of everyone. Because of this improvement, we can use many IT devices and internet services anywhere and anytime we want. We can enjoy games, video contents, messenger and other things with the IT devices. In current days, smartphone is one of the most spotlighted IT devices in the world. We need just one small smartphone to enjoy all things and share with our family or friends. Firstly as everybody know the cost of the fuel is increasing more and more,  adding to those the bill that own a car will bring, it became immediately clear that it is cheaper go around by public transport. First of all, conversation among people are reduced by the smartphones. Moreover also simple things are changed, for example the food we eat: some times ago everythingh was natural, healthy... but now everyone eat always ""junk food"" and thinghs like that, which are completely unhealthy ! We can meet and talk with neighborhoods in the elevator of apartment, and any friends we can see at the playground. We can also talk with our family on evening or whole holidays, and go to cinema together or listen to the music at the radio. However, nowadays, we can see lots of contents on OTT applications such as Youtube and Netflix, so we normally enjoy it ourselves in our room without any talk. Finally, Taiwan still suffers economic slump, but we have so many businesses likes to innovate, market their product, customers likes to buy it. The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years In addition, because of the use of smartphones, we don't think about exercise or other physical activities. Without the smartphones, people always enjoyed sports such as soccer and basketball easily with their friends or family. It made our bodies and brains healthy. Also people can talk and communicate with other people while playing sports. In the case of social activites, people needed to go out and meet others to talk about their business or just for chat. But i was so mad at him and so ansiouns to make his life imposible, and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the sufering i had been throug became stronger and bigger, i had made a desition i was goingo to do it, if he dedicated 4 years of his life tourtoring me and not wanting me to be happy i would the time is nesesary for him to have a miserable life and i wont stop until i had acomplished my goald It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs.In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us.In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable. We can enjoy all sports with game without any communication with others. The story tell us the story of Monica(Scarlett Johansson) and her routine living in ""Cretacro"" an enormous mysterious island located in the Pacific Ocean,the problem starts when Monica fell in love with Martin. For these reasons, the smartphones reduced a lot of communication and conversation with our family and friends. If you ask someone about the future, answers will be different but all will be around two main topics, Those last are either optimist future or pessimist one. If we keep going with this method that using the smartphones, we can't go back to good days of past days."	3
377	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"I disagree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Being a college student requires a certain level of commitment towards academia and the decision to be enrolled in a college already somewhat sets some kind of priority that education should be more important above anything else such as having a part-time job. A reason why someone would attend college is so that they can attain a degree in order to secure better future job prospects. Having a part-time job is not only time-consuming but usually requires effort too and would be physically tiring. Nowadays,an increasing number of people are concerned about the phenomenon that armland ,forest and wetland is disappearing for some long-term human activities,for instant housing and transport networks is builded by destroying the balance of environment. Also, there's a lack of time for the student to sufficiently study and revise what is taught. Last month,my friend came to Korea and visited me.In the morning We went to Ocean Park ,we saw dolphin,cat, horse and many animals .In the afternoon we went to play rollar coatser,I screamed on top of voice and called for help .Actually I hate playing rollar coster .We played mind train ,punch and a lot of games .At the end of the day I was just like running out of gas ,because I was too tired to walk any further. The creator of the haven and the earth, the creator of soles , the one who make earth rotate around it self and around the sun.What we belief as Muslims that, we have created by one who don't have other with him the one who create our father (Adam ) and created from him (Eve) and they were in the Paradise and instructed to not eat from the tree but the Satan deceive them so they brought to this life and generations came from them and had sent the prophet and messengers ( Moses, Jesus, Mohamed, others.. who they worship the same one) with Miracles and evidence of the truth, to guide the people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to the Paradise and who follow other paths which it will guide to the hell. I want to say something about the learning of the English Languaje, is hard to get to me for the next reasons: First reason; the grammar that the learners, teachers or institutes teach, is  like the Spanish Languaje, my native Languaje. I feel that the only exception whereby part-time jobs can be seen as important for college students is that if the part-time job they take up is for work experience or research purposes that are related to what they are pursuing in college. Hence, a part-time job may be important only if it is for internship purposes. Otherwise, a part-time job should not be a priority or seen as important for college students."	3
378	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"I agree with this opinion. There are some reasons. However,the family is near you since the day you were born until forever.The members follow you,and can based on them.You can tell whatever you want to them.For example,if you are in a bad mood the first person that will come next to you,to make you smile is your mom or dad.Mom and dad spent their life to grow up their children,to feed them,to love them! Michael is a good boy and he always listen to his mother .on time Michael was very angry as he got a bad score in his test .when he was home his mother was cooking she asked him what is the wrong ? As Automotive Industries are huge in market, most of the  house holders  prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time . So if you want to work in Egypt you must have a complete information about the job (location ,salary,incentives, Allowances , work environment,position titles , company type,policy ,mission,vision)                                                                                               With best Wishes                                                                                                Sameh Sabbagh Probably, there are another college student, or woman who have children, or people from other region etc. Those who can know many things that you don't know or you don't learn at your college. So you can learn not only at school but also at a place you work. Third, if you experience many kind of works through a part-time job, you can learn what it is about working. And you can image how you want to work. The time that you are college students is only a few years, but you must prepare for future before graduate college. positives ways for playing badminton: you can lose weight , you vision will be good etc   negatives ways for playing badminton: you right arm is more strong than you left arm , sometime,you are sprain your arm . Personally I believe that those who are not participate any activity the teachers has them to encourage .Then only they also know how talented they are.Every student should attend and show their talent.After some ages we can not attend any this type of activity because we all are become old .So let do and enjoy your young age be happier. If students spend much more time on part-time job and they can't have enough time to study, they should reduce the time that they spend on part-time job."	3
379	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Censorship in libraries is almost a primitve if not childish way to exclude what one might think to be offensive from everyone else, is it not? Think about it. A kid who doesn't let another kid play with him at recess today, only because he stuck his tongue out at him during math the previous day, seems pretty childish, and several much more reasonable solutions come to mind to anyone who sits and thinks about the situation for more than a second. This scenario runs paralell with censorship in libraries. A book is a book to be read. That is, of course, an obvious statement. But why read a book? To get information. They are called below: 1- chaharshanbeh soori 2- Norouz 3- sizdehbedar  chahrshanbeh soori:  It meaning Tuesday night of week and take place on last Tuesday night of the year .at this night people make a bonfire and jump over the fires and say to fire :I give you my sign of sickness(yellow color)and you give me your healthy sign (red color)and eat some special foods . How do you cook an exquisite meal? Go read a book to find out. How do you graph linear equations? While I were in ANDRAPRADESH every year we have Christmas function in December although we are not interested to attend Drama they were not leave us without participation even simple character.They gave me a character like THE GOD .Firstly I never aware about how act and do this particular character.And from October to till December we practise everyday after our study hour up to eleven ""O""CLOCK.DAY BY DAY  I learn and finally I did my role well.Then I think myself why I wasted all my school days . Apart from that you see new places and you have fun, you also lern others cultures, historicals facts, you also lern to respect others peoples and thirs costums. Now, of course cooking a turkey will most likely not come across as offensive to someone perusing through their local library, however, think about this. The book has been written, so is that not a sure sign it is not offensive to at least one person, that being the author? There are things people will not agree with. I will tell you a review of a thriller, the thriller is Hunger games it is about some capitals and people are choised and play on a game, you have to kill persons for they don't kill you, is a movie that have suspense because you want to know ho survey, in the movie someone love someone and protect each others, is very cute but on the 3 movies they are bad moments with the family, capitals, Friends, etc. Not everyone likes rap music, but it is still playing on the radio. Them they drink a cafe that give them many energy to construct faster the building, this café has a combination for the people can to live all the night. It is a free choice to read a book, regardless of what it says. Just because people have the misfortune to be subjected to material they find offensive, by accident or otherwise, and then project their disdainful comments toward someone in charge, does not mean that the offensive material should be thrown out. Perhaps, radios and libraries can be even further examined. To start with,there are a wide range of troublesome it maybe leadding to this phenomeon.Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the persent day cities are already packed with places of residence,commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce.Additionally, people now continues destroyed more agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their need,which will distory the ecosystem  diversity and biodiversity especially the endangered species. There is a country music channel for those who want to listen to country music. As for libraries, there is of course the @ORGANIZATION1, but that is about as far as categoriazation goes. Suppose books be even further distinguished by the location within a library. A certain area designated for certain genres. That way, if you happen to find books about @CAPS1 concentration camps distasteful, then you can avoid the @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 ailse of the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 section in your library. This perspective of life is inspired by contracultural movements and some people call to these people as “alternative”, but it is each day more common and it let a inclusive and diverse society. I find it hard to see something as offensive if I can't even literally see it. You see, outright removal isn't really the best option for pleasing dissatisfied people. So they make a plan to display all... The next day when they were about to start filming they ere non ants there so they search for them, but they can't find them... In that moment the ants and Penny attack them in their backs, making them to leave the place. Now, after having thought about this situation for more than a second, I'm sure you have thought of much more reasonable solutions than something so ludicrous as censorship. Now the best part is seeing people enjoy books, and not being offended by the ones they don't like anymore"	3
380	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"we bocome not only older but also wiser .we learn but the most useful thing to learn is to get in alot of experiences & for sure to make mistakes .but we have to be honest with our selves by admitting our mistakes to avoid them in the future . That is why computers have a good effect on people today. To begin with,the format of the bank notes needs to be designed,factors of considerations including the background colour,the artwork and the security issues.Sencondly,equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps.Thirdly,print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink,where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes. Kids rely on them for studying or homework. For all the people I advise to start to play or watching football because for me it is a very good sport , but you can play a good football only if you really like it , because first football is fun . Thats why computers have a good effect on us. Like me, many kids have family across the ocean or just across the country, either way, contacting them is tough. According to the information donne, the most used is the car thus most of the families has one, but the public transportation is getting more and more common for those ones who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectfully with the planet. The gym has many problems that we are gouing to explain : the first problem is that we don´t have enough aparatous for all of the students  the second problem is about that same aparatous are not working well because the school didn´t the manteinace long time ago For the first problem in my opinion , the school have to buy some others aparatus because there are not enough for all of the students For the second problem the solution for me is to hire someone to do the maintenance and say to all of the students to take care of the machines of the school I hope my proposal wiil be useful for you I look forward to hearing from you soon Sebastián Ferrari You can also have conversations through email with no problem. Another very effective way to contact family is through skype or a web cam. This way you can see your family from miles away in the comfort of your own home. Computers help kids too. Kids like me always have homework on the computer. It could be typing up a final draft of a paper or taking notes on a historical figure, either way they both require a computer. Sure, there are books to take notes on people, but do books type up papers? Kids and teenagers can also use them for studying. I constantly use the computer to practice spanish buy using a website with worksheets a flash card to help me. Computers nbot only help kids, they help adults too. so, on my opinion, even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers They are constantly sending emails, typing proposals and all those things. And without a computer all that would be very challenging. They told her that her brother had a car accident first of all she shocked  Then she went quickly to the train station and she bought ticket to London when she was in the train she had other phone cell . My father, an electrition, has to sned out emails and documents about his latest project several times a week. In these diagrams below,the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly.The first step,the bank notes should be desinged concidering some constructions,like background color,artwork and security issues,After it was prepared,skilled machinists would make preparaation of metal plates in the second step.Then,sheets of bank notes would be printed by 50 bank notes per sheet,which have colour imagines on both sides in special ink.After printing well,these sheets would be manually inspected closely.It was the most important step during the whole processing.And then,some  sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets  which would be cut into and separated into equal ones andpacked and depatched to where they are demanded. For example, ordering clothes and toys, but most popular is doing your taxes online. Only if the government develop more technical property,pay more attention to the environment protection ,such as build more trees and grass in the cities ,and set a special low for those missed animals will help decrease the harm that the building project brings to us. Computers have a good effect for people of this age. Not only i sthat my opinion, it is also more of a fact. As long as i try to keep doing thing on a ecofriendly way i realize that i am give a little from my side and i feel careful of my environment. Not only are they helpful, but they are necessary and I hope your agree with me."	3

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"To whom @CAPS5 @MONTH1 concern at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS5's possible, imagine a world @CAPS7 computers, @CAPS1 drivers are bumping around and having difficulty watching the wheel and the road, phone bills are throughh the roof because of the whole world having no other way of communicating, and students are home worried sick that they don't have a book to study with. Computers affect all of these areas of our lives. They teach hand-eye coordination, allows us to communicate with others dozens of ways, and let students learn and stay up-dated from their very own home. Computers must stay a fundamental part of our every day. To begin, computers must remain in our community because they teach even young children hand-eye coordination. In a recent report the @ORGANIZATION2 states that in the past five years; the number of driving students who pass on their first try has almost doubled. The video games, the computer mice, and even typing the brain at a young age to work in sync with the body's arms, finger and other apend ages, ""@CAPS5's not only on the road where hand-eye counts."" says @PERSON1, head of surgery at @ORGANIZATION1 hospital. ""@CAPS6 finding that younger doctors, ones that grew up on video and computer games, can form robotics surgery with much more presision than our older atendings."" But, the public transportation have a lot of future bacase a lot of reassons, first the time, if the place you want to reach finally is really far the different type of vehicles of public transportation will get you there faster than your car, also the complications about the field, like if you want to go from America to Europe there is no highway that cross the ocean you need an airplane and unless you have one, you will cannot reach travel between continents with your car, a different reasson is politics, because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska you will not need to pass through Canada, the commodity is a really important reasson because drive for 8 hours is exhausting and it will be unsafe also, the economics is a factor to, because the attrition of your car it will be more that in the normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do, it will be expensive that in public transportation. It is a problem of mentality, if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally. Playing the cricket will also gives physical exercise to our body.we can bowl,batt,field in the cricket which  requires lot of  physical activities. Secondly, computers should be part of homes because they allow people to communicate with others world. One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance,  homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society. Yes,I think it also can educate.As times go by,technology is rapidly improving.More and more gadgets are invented such as televisions,smartphones and so on.There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly.Using will not only gain the entertainment but also get the knowledge.For instance,there are numerous program that we can choose.It is a good time to turn to the entertaining program,when we feel bored and gaze the wall all the day.Television provides educated varieties of channels as well.Discovery channel is posture-oriented model example to educate.We can learn how do the different animals feed on themselves.Above the statements can ensure a rich and abundant live. in a car accident , when she her what happened with her brother she was so nervous then the miracle happened she found a big suitcase in the train she decided to open the bag because no one was in the train so she opened the bag she surprised when she saw  a lot of money inside the bag  . when i ran with the ball, i feel that i hold a goal or a valuable something and i should offer my best to put it in his place and make it in right way  . Finaly, computers can help students learn. In todays schools, students depend on homework being posted online, and getting their books over the web. Once, my brother didn't take home his book-bag for a week, and got all online. We was greatful for the strain off his back. Although the public transport is slow but it also do not take a long time of people to reach their destination because public transport nowadays are developed more fast and enough. The future for the public transport shouldn't be  taken lightly,  in my opinion, the public transport is the best option for ending the problems with the traffic jam because when we use a bus or subway , a lot of people is travelling from one place at other in only one transport or vehicle. @NUM5 out of @NUM2 highschoolers say they use a book for researh less than once a month. As you can see, the internet is a valuable learning tool. In conclusion, computers help as with coordination, communication and education. no of all people could afford to make conveyenc by car .car is easy and cozy also but public transprt is fair is much affordable to all clasess of poeple public transport means mainly pubic bus.people used to travell long disistance by publis bus .it is possible to carry large number of people of different places to carry in bus."	3

In this day in age, numerous advances in technology are being made everyday. The one advance that has stood out above the rest is the invention of the computer. For just one invention, the computer has many capabilities: @CAPS1 access for educational purposes, keeping people in touch, and opening people up to new aspects of life. The computer has helped mankind with various discoveries about our world. As far as many can see, this piece of technology has positive effects on people everywhere, everyday. The service is very bad the drivers are very angry and stressed out these do not lead with cauition, in Toluca exist report of high rates of accidents by buses. The reason for this is that this technology takes learning to places it has never gone before. Whether a student has to write on essay about the presidency of @PERSON1 or obtain background information for a science experiment about paper towel also bency a computer can aid them in finding the information they need. In modern life,we rely on traffic to work or travel to everywhere.It is conveninet to travel by private cars .The price of private cars which every one can afford it,so that everyone has the private car nowadays .Some people point out private cars are going to replace the public transport . For children that don't ""school or adults that want a college education, computers let them learn what they need to from online schools. It is also important to @CAPS1 that they can keep in touch with friends after school hours. Computers are able to help them with this. public transport is very crowded so you may not have a seat .I hate public transport as I was attacked by mad man once .also taxi is  not a good transport .I wish I have my own car soon to get rid of public transport . Last month,my friend came to Korea and visited me.In the morning We went to Ocean Park ,we saw dolphin,cat, horse and many animals .In the afternoon we went to play rollar coatser,I screamed on top of voice and called for help .Actually I hate playing rollar coster .We played mind train ,punch and a lot of games .At the end of the day I was just like running out of gas ,because I was too tired to walk any further. Some friends and family keep in touch completely by computer. Because they don't live close enough to visit daily. after that the celebration was began and a lot of their friends have attended each one presented a gift for Sara , she was very delighted and suddenly the doorbell been rang  she was her old friend Tia . This contact with new people is just one way that computer is croaden one's horizons. Computers are like keys; they open doors to new places and ideas. So my idea is aii the coutries allthe people stop to use farmland,forest andwetlang to build houses grow more trees portect our world,our homestar! No progress will happen without plan .Each one has a dream want to achieve it but first of all he need to put a plan and also cognitive one . On the internet, there are many video tutorials that teach people different skills for free. In one's spare time, they could use a computer to research the people of @LOCATION1 or the pyramids of @LOCATION2. first we uses Internet to discover the world's news, from Internet we can check and read world's most famous newspaper such as new York times, the sun and also electronic newspaper.Internet also can be used to learn and to educate yourself, internet allow us to read books, magazines and short stories.Internet is the most effective way to start a business and to look for a job, many people uses Internet to work , and they earning money every month.Internet is a way to make new friends all over the world through social websites such as Facebook,twitter, and you tube.As a conclusion internet is making things better and easier, life now is always connected to the Internet. The reason is the next, three days ago, he was working when a girl of his job asked him whether he had girlfriend and he told, I had one, come on you know my ex-girlfriend then she only walked without tell nothing. My town do much efforts to care of environment,they put many pins in the streets to keep it clean also they prevent private drivinig at many days to keep air clean ,they seed trees to absorb co2 and release o2 ,they build factories away from the house of population to prevent respiratory diseases which is a result of air pollution from factories,so not only my country it self but also the individuals follow a proper way to keep environment clean. It is astounding what you could learn from just hopping on a computer. Especially keep in mind that computers are for more than just entertainment: they're for education as well.

          Our body needs to rest and relax every now and then. Going to new places and experiancing new things are the main ways our body can relax. To do this and have the full relaxation experiance we will need a longer break time from work. Although it is impossible to totally detach someone from work, it is possible to take the mind off of things while experiancing something fun. Thus I believe weekends are good time to have  vacations. To experiance this relaxation completely having vacation with loved one is recommended. People can travel through the city easily and safely.For instance Melbourn,the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area.Therefore people don't need to drive cars for travelling in the city.The last point is people go for long journey by public transport.Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive. For other hand, People make other inventions for improving the world and reduce pollution, for example, In this time we have created electric cars or organic food, these things are very useful in future, because we will need to reduce pollution. The ocean breath, the fresh air, and the experiance of exploring ones creativity by building sand castels are the main reasons for this. I don’t like Narnia, but my favorite movie is probably 22 jump street, Lord of the rings, The tv-show: suits, The walking dead and maybe south park and family guy. This inturn will create a better experiance and add to the relaxation process. Thus, going to the beach is a means to relax, meet new people, and get Vitamin D.
          Second, the cinema is a good place to spend on the weekend. The cinema is a good place to watch movies and experiance life in other person's shoes. For example, a person might choose to watch an action movie filled with scenes like jumping out of airplanes, this enables the person to experiance what it is like to skydive without actually paying the expensive fees of skydiving or risking his/her life. In addition, experiancing the movies with a loved one increases the bond between the two. This is because of the feeling of experiancing the scenes together. Therefore, going to the cinema is a means to experiance life in other people's view and also strengthen the bond with a loved one. Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath...deep one and started to dive . After two years that his essay was released, he will understand that his essay was wrong moreover, Michael will want to apologise many people who read his essay thereby Michael now goes home, takes a cup of tea, goes to bed thus Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake One can experiance the emotion and culture of the people by looking at the their art. This is because the feeling of people and their culture is reflected through the colors and design of their art. In the end,if it is a good sheet,the porcedure is packaging and distribution,including cutting into separate bank notes,packing,dispatching.If it is a bad sheet,the porcedure is disposal    --bad sheetsand bank notes should be securely destroyed. Also, just for young children that are in process of growth and development, physical exercise is essential to do it, because they can have a healthier life.Young children try to effort, and wants to win at this age, and if they train results were better and encourages to keep training.In psychic way, if you are adapated forms relations and create new friends. Someday he woke up early at the morning he go out for playing football before school, when he's playing he saw something running very fast and go away. Thus going to the art gallery is a means to increase ones creativity and admire people's cultre and emotions. In conclusion, going to the beach, the cinema, or the art gallery is the best way to spend the weekend with a loved one. Secondly, it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting a time in waiting a specific time to move or even waste a time in waiting a public transportation to reach all point it should get it , but in the other side when  you have your own transport or a private transport is get a right to choose time of trip or when you want to move or stay, and nowadays we cannot waste our time in taking public transport. In art gallery, one can experiance the culture and emotions of each other creating a strong bond. about my rest of family , as I said before they are just a relatives , but even if they are not friends almost ,but I do love them to much ,first one is my aunt ,the dead one ,and the other who still alive ,but i don't feel that felling of love towards my uncle , I do love him ,but he is just my uncle no more ."	3
384	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"I decided and went.It was strange because I never went to the sports.From the time I started going to karate.After one month my instructor told me that I will go to the competition.I was very worrying and nervous. FILM: LUCY (2014) TThe plot of this film is about a 25 naive woman that was living and studying in Taiwan and one night went out for clubbing and met a nutter guy that involved her in a seedy drug smuggling issue with a Corean criminal band that forced her to be a mule drug. But lot of peoples saying that, the zoo can protected endagered spices against illegal poachers. Not me. I think that computers detach people from reality, create false personas, and has no physical benefit. This is what i think the computers effects have on people. First of all, Computers detach people from reality. Its a lot easier for someone to sit on the computer, browsing aimlessly on some social networking website, than go out and actually meet new people. Sure you @CAPS2 send all the friend requests you want, but theres nothing that compares to a first impression that you get from meeting someone in person. Secondly,tourism,especially in developed countries,has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view.There are countries,such as Greece or Bulgaria,in which the econmoy relies merely on tourism.If tourism influences the econmy,it thereby influnces the environment,and if it influences the environment it influences the transport.How?people become more careful at their historcal sites,this way preserving them;Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale:At a small scale,in cities, in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently.At a large scale,people can now travel in almost any possible way:on land,on sea or air.Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations. Secondly, the computer creates false personas. Tom friend of Peter suddenly fainted fell down in the class room I don't know what to do immediately, first calm down yourself and I checked his pulse beat it is okay,then I knew that he is out of danger so I called my classmates everyone rushing to the spot but still he is not moving so we decide to take him into the hospital or call the ambulance, finally we  call the ambulance without ant delay. The computer dosn't know better. This allows people to gain, ""friendships"" with others that dont know the real you. I find this as a real problem because eventually lead to shaky or unsteady relationshops. Adolescent has always been the hardest part throughout anybody's whole life.. turning out in a fleeting glimpse into an adult, perceiving the other side of life,how tough and complicated it is, trying to deal with its different circumstances.. at this point you merely have a brief look at your whole life, many questions spinning in your head, accusing yourself of being a lost cause, wishing if you could turn the clock back,,but it's all no good.. then you find yourself standing ahead clouds of reality, which sucks.. life is stages, this stage of your life is timeless, no way out.. at some point you wish if it was all illusio, you need a time machine makes it possible to go back in time when you could see the purity of life.. However..here you are completely different made of life lessons, preferring to make a stiff upper lip..cowering in your own reality. With things easier to get now a days like fast food, and drugs, I don't think that computers help. People need discipline and theres a time and place for everything, including computers. one day Micheal wanted to go out from his home so he called his besfriend an suggested to go out togther , his friend agreed , so Michael weared his closes , wnet out and closed the door but at this moment he knew he had made a mistake . So @CAPS2 you imagine a world controlled by computers? I think that little by little, thats whats happening, slowly taking away the human element. my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long. I don't think its right, but I hope I've persuaded you to think my way."	3

"I like going to the cinema, get out with my friends,  to playing the counter strike, walking to the park, going the shopping and can't stand watching the blood. The creator of the haven and the earth, the creator of soles , the one who make earth rotate around it self and around the sun.What we belief as Muslims that, we have created by one who don't have other with him the one who create our father (Adam ) and created from him (Eve) and they were in the Paradise and instructed to not eat from the tree but the Satan deceive them so they brought to this life and generations came from them and had sent the prophet and messengers ( Moses, Jesus, Mohamed, others.. who they worship the same one) with Miracles and evidence of the truth, to guide the people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to the Paradise and who follow other paths which it will guide to the hell. It cause a lot of diseases such as lung, throat, and mouth cancers, premature births, sterility and early menopause, and it makes one look older. Scientific studies show that addicted smokers skin will be grey color, thick, and wrinkled. In addition, the smokers can also harm the health of the other non-smokers with their cigarette smoke. Today personal vehicle become pride of the life , mean if a person is on there personal vehicle they are look as higher status in the society . In the restaurant, people are eating something. During are eating, it is easy to breathe by second-hand smoke. In this case, second-hand smoke will be more than normal situation. As we know public transportation has not a direct way to fulfill our all destinations then it force us to stop in many stations first, moreover we should take the other one to reach our destination so it is already obvious why using a car is better. By prohibiting smoking in a like restaurant, we may be saving the lives of hundreds of people, including your own as well as yours family. If a survey was taken asking people how often they deliberately put the lives of their friends and family at risk, it's a pretty safe bet that most people would say never. However they may be forced to reconsider their."	3

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. To combat the distriction of enviornment,this is a serious problem throughout the world.Nowadays ,many trees and grasses are damaged in many countries,lots of building are constricated.And people should pay attention to this problem and try to slove it. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens.So I do not agree with this afirmation, in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. This attitude reduced enromous amount of smoke pollution from the pipes.Government policy changes help a lot for water preservation.Many factories follwing the regulations and not draining the harmful wastage in the water. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real. Consider both aspects that can be concluded that government should respect the human right and set up a new department which use for people who want to apply to complete the military service. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. In my life,many dreams have existed in my mind,which is sweet ,incredible,magical or horrible.However,one of dreams is keeping in my heart that I can't forget it forever. It is true that we are a lot of users that want to use the car but, and that amount is  growing up; as well there are a lot of people that don't have the posibility to have a car and some use the public transportation because many reasons like the price, because it is easier to get to the place by public transportation rather than car, because the traffic, some times for people it is so exhausting to drive lots of hours an even some times the public transportation is faster. So,my favourite sport in the present time it is street workout.I have been exercising this sport already long time.I like to exercise on the street even in the season when the temperature outside below zero.Of course, in summer I like to exercise more than in winter but this don't stop me.I don't know myself why,but I almost every day go on the street in order to exercise.If  It is very coldly and windily outside,I don't worry about it and I'm exsercising at home.For those people, who want to start to exercise the street workout I'm advising to start with basic exerscises such as pull ups,push ups,dips and squats.That everything basic exercises and they will help you will do a good start up.After some time when you will be feeling that you are ready for more, you can start to study more difficult exercises. This is terrible, you do not have privacy authought the society have a blame, because if they do not take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. My favourite sport is playing tennis.I play it three times a week (on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays) in the club of tui.I had been playing tennis from 2 years ago with two of my best friends.I enjoy playing tennis because it is a sport that requires skills, concentration and speed.I am not very good at all but I like to play it with my friends and do matches on Saturdays . People can travel through the city easily and safely.For instance Melbourn,the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area.Therefore people don't need to drive cars for travelling in the city.The last point is people go for long journey by public transport.Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately.He had to buy a present for his girlfriend´s birthday but it was Sunday and all stores were closed so he had to found a solution.A few hours,he was walking by a garden,and suddenly,he saw the most beautiful flowers that he has ever seen,so he picked them up.However,flowers weren´t enough so he decided to think in anything else.Several hours later,he found an open sweet shop and he bought some bonbons for her.Finally,he had found the present and before the end of the day he ran quickly to his girlfriend's house.If you don't want to pass this situation,you must always do things with time. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. First of all, thank you professor to teach in the meantime, the entire course of the learn really benefited, especially in the first meeting, for British English, I still did not really understand, it makes me frustrated, but gradually after I found the beautiful of the language in British English, I think it’s all because of the usual problem of American English, and so I really appreciate that you choose simple  textbooks and it’s easy to learn, and you really very carefully and very humorous, you're always careful in curriculum pronunciation correction for each student, using a variety of reading skills let us immerse them read. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. most of girl doesnt like this,i think that it takes us energy,we need to do exercise,reasonable diet...and so on. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society."	3

And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries.

"Certain materials, such as books, music, magizines, etc., should never be removed just because a certain person, or group of people, find it offensive. Most importantly,manually inspected on each printed sheet in case that there would exist damaged sheets.Once damaged sheets are discovered, partically separate them into good and bad ones and them burn the bad notes,making sure that the remaining sheets are of good quality . Also, certain materials that some people find offensive have little to no offensiveness to many other people who @MONTH1 enjoy the book or movie. Finally, many books that are on the shelves of many of our libraries have no end to the amount of things that @MONTH1 be considered offensive, but allow a certain knowledge to be had by, not only the writer, but the reader as well. If something is stated in such an important document as the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, one that set the standard for living and set the laws of a nation to parchment, than it should, for lack of a better term, be taken with the utmost respect and dignity. In those days almost 80% of people have assured feel preocupation about their bodies and their alimentation, for this they convidenced me that they will try improve their habitual alimentation everyday and their will do sport more frequently. This simple fact alone should hold more than enough levity to allow all materials, no matter how offensive, to not only be published, but also enjoyed by all people. There is a man who is most important for one's life.I am not different from that.there is a back stairs influence    in my life he is none but my father.I respect him so much and admire also.He is my best friend who never hurts me.He always helps me by giving good advance.He is an ideal farmer who never and even tells a lie.His means of livelihood is the simplest.He always honors the oldest and taught us of avoiding tells a lie.so far as I remember one day he was advising me suddenly a old man entered the conversation and told a foolish speech. Certain materials that a person, or group of people, find offensive @MONTH1 not be offensive to everyone. When printing finished,they should inspection.It the most important step.Printed sheets manually inspected.Finally,they  found good quality sheets and some partially damaged sheeets or bad sheets.They will packaging and distribution the sheets which is good in there.In that time they at fist cut into separate bank notes ,second they packed the sheets and diapatched. Many people in this world serve in their nations military, ones used to fight more battles than any history book could hold, is just one example that not everyone in this world holds the same morals or ideas that others do, and tensions will always arise because of it. That being said, this also holds true to the way certain people percieve literature and art. Yes,I think it also can educate.As times go by,technology is rapidly improving.More and more gadgets are invented such as televisions,smartphones and so on.There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly.Using will not only gain the entertainment but also get the knowledge.For instance,there are numerous program that we can choose.It is a good time to turn to the entertaining program,when we feel bored and gaze the wall all the day.Television provides educated varieties of channels as well.Discovery channel is posture-oriented model example to educate.We can learn how do the different animals feed on themselves.Above the statements can ensure a rich and abundant live. I think it would be important that, not only in the family, but also in the school could be grow a new generaion sensible to ecological problems of the earth. This is disheartening for several reasons, one being that whatever we, as a human race, could've learned from this piece is now lost forever. Many books could teach the older generations how to leave a legacy for generations to come. There are many sports grounds for example tennis cort,football grounds and play equipment for child so I think my town takes care of environment that makes everyone will be able to best condition in both mind and body long time. These are best portrayed in books that are sometimes removed from the shelves because of hard lessons or graphic words used. Is censorship in libraries ok? No. Not at all. All works of literature should be allowed to be read and enjoyed, not only by the author, but also by the young, the old, and all ages in between, of all races and religions. The longer we allow materials to be removed from the shelves of our libraries, the less of a chance we are giving, not only ourselves, but future generations to learn and be all that they can possibly be."	3

One of these things is anything that undermines or degrades one's religious beliefs.

I would like to say for anyone wants playing soccer to be very careful when he plays it because it may cause a lot of injures ,but in the same time it is very nice game. This type of material should only be given to an older audience. If you are living in big town or small It does matter but one thing should be taking care by the people and organiser of the town, is environment.Global warming  is huge issue in today's date. As time goes on people are taking religion more and more serious. With that being said I don't think anyone would want to read a book or watch a movie in which the things they believe in being made fun of or rejected. It @MONTH1 not seem like harmful material at first glance, but your opinion @MONTH1 change when your customers come back angry and frustrated about what they read and saw. It would be a better choice to avoid this conflict with your customers and keep this material out of your library, unless you want to deal with complaints and costant arguments.

Racism has been one the worlds largest problems, it affects us all no matter who it's against. Picture a book in your library that calls all black teens a problem or a book that says all arabians dangerous, racist isn't it? Now imagine if your customers were of one of those two ethnicities, it's not a good picture at all. Keeping these stereotypes and harmful sayings off library shelves is a great business choice and will keep all customers happy. Obesity and other thins about help, is a topic very important because the people is dying for this problem.For example, the form to prepare the food, is gonna be dangerous because a lot food have artificial thing that is no good for us. Lastly I think books that express violent and criminal acts should be censored from minors. Kids always follow what they hear or what they see. Since they're still in that stage where they rarely do things in their own way they @MONTH1 mimic or copy things they see. Another problem that surrounds this is peer pressure which will get more and more children commiting these acts.

389	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"In this era of technology, the advancement of technology are gradually changing the way people live their lives. One of the most crucial changes is related to the improvements of computers which become nearly the most essential thing in daily life. The issue of whether computers have made life easier and more convenient or made it more complex and stressful has always been a hot topic over decades. Although many people argue that computers are changing life in a more sophisticated and stressful way, I still believe in the opposite direction where it actually makes our lives easier for the following reasons. Hi,I am Amy.I would like to spend two months studying in English,two months doing volunteering in children charity and the least two months travelling in UK.What do you think of my plan?I will not only improve my English skills but also devote myself to get along with children.The most important of all,I will take an adventure to the unknown place in UK.I am looking forward to seeing you soon.I would like to invite you to join the road trip with me.it must be an amazing experience if we are together for this trip.As long as you can go with me just let me know. Thank you  very much Joe for think in me for to be your witnees, I feel very proud that you think in me for to be your witnees and of course I accept and I will  be in Toronto for your wedding. For example, engineers can use computers for coding to control robots in factory that enhance the accuracy in producing products. That I want to say, is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb's in Spanish Languaje, just Imaging you the same but not in your native lenguaje. Thus, computers help reducing the labor workforce and supporting human with providing quality products. Another beneficial factor that computers help us is they faster the way people communicate each other. on the other hand, public transportation takes more time to get to the required station, because already public transport taking long path to go across more places and as more as peoples take benefits from it, and public transport usually crowed and do not be on time. In addition, the way individuals exchanging letters also different comparing to the past. If in the past people had to wait over months for letters to be transfered, now they can just simple write their emails in few minutes and send them over internet for just few seconds. Despite the positive reinforcement of my idea, some people still claim that computers make our lives harder because they make work around us more complex. However, I should say that we work to make others lives happier. You should knew about the prize for coming to the museum is very cheap ($15.00) for hour if you want to stay more time the prize increase in $10.00. while we are spendind good time watching TV our brain is not in calm, only in an other position different to that ones in the rest od the day.That's why I think that it's a good momento to see the thing through a new glass and that can be a very high opportunity. In conclusion, it is true that computers are actually trying to provide human with more convenient life. finally ,a public transport need more costs , because public transport (such a buses , train ) fees every year is increasing, and this problem we do not face it by private transport ,"	3

If there was a book on a shelf in a bookstore that you didn't agree with and thought should be removed, and you removed it, then you are taking away from someone who @MONTH1 enjoy that book. If everyone removed things from life that they didn't enjoy, then there would be very little to enjoy. I start this sport since I was 10 years old.where my father was playing this sport also,but he started it when he was more greater than me,He was about 30 years old.where squash is one of the games that can be played in any age,I love this game because I find it making exercise to all the body in the same time , we are running in small place moving hands in stretched and different ways in the same time you are working your mind in the same time so it need caring and quik thinkink, as much exercise you will find down the road . I love the thrill you get from a horror movie and how they can make you jump even though it's just a movie screen. I'm sure there are people in this world who think horror movies are wrong.

In my opinion, Family is the place that had you best friend can help each other and know each.In the Taiwan,many of people have to take care of them parent when they get old,but the point is what if you can not survival,I mean you don't have enough money to raise you parent.Back to the topic,I don't know well any of member of in my family,I don't trust them,honestly. Video games are a huge part of my life, and I know for a fact that there are people who highly disagree with some of the content of them. If people could take video games away because they didn't agree with them, i would be crushed. I am also aware that people @MONTH1 just be worried about their children watching movies, listening to songs, or reading books that are not appropriate for them. Football is my favorite sports In my life.so,I pay more attention to it than any other things you might think of.I had been following series of football's events in and around the world at large.I took this time to command people who are sacrificing their entire life of the betterment of sportsmanship.With all that,I do have my favorite club team n country as well.And also have my favorite players,Ronaldinho,Messi and Eto'o.My favorite club is Barcelona and country is Cameroon although that I am from Liberia.I know football doesn't go by sentiments but the love of choice and what desire you the best.What really makes me to love Barcelona is that they play the football,instead of them running around.They always bring talented players that will make the club be more improved tactically.people always say this;""Barcelona doesn't buy players""it's not like,they are lacking money.We do essential purchasing of players to save more money.You have to save money for players to enable you to pay them on time.As normal humanbeings,you have to know how to spend money,where,when to spend it.it's not because you have more money then you lavish it.So,i love my team and my staff and how they run things in my team.The facts should not be hidden Barcelona is the best club team in the world,you like or not. Movies and books can easily be censored. Many movies and songs have language filters and some movie programs now have parental options that allow the parents to decide what movies they want to allow their children to watch. Fortunately  Kabul structured  by Mountains and have mountainous climate, approximately this town  have 15 (mm) Raining per year the remarkable Agricultural area and forestry all around the town have a positive effect for the Kabul city environment and producing  Fresh air for the citizens of the mentioned town Video games also require parental consent depending on the rating of the game. We can't just go around removing everything we dont like, because it is not fair to those who @MONTH1 like it.

And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries.

"Some people guess the nuclear power has a great value to produce power instead of the fossil fuels such as : coals and oil which are Not renewable energy.Moreover, they think that controlling the pollution is possible. Her mom tried to tell Fernanda that they arrived very late because they had a very perplexed problem, so her mom told her that they came out from the park at 9:00pm it was still late but not too late, so they were on the street and the police arrived because they police thought that she had a globe with wine, and her mother told the police that she doesn't have alcohol or wine on her car, and they police didn't believed her and they took them to the police station so they could check his car, and about 10 minutes approximately they told her that she didn't have nothing so they, went from there to their house and it was late, so that’s the reason. In the past, books have been censured by rulers and leaders who thought that the material was harmful. This process involves five main stages.First,it should take some considerations in design,including background colour,artwork,security issues.Next,skilled machinists is prepared ,in which there are metal plates.Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet).Subsequently, the technical must be used specially for distinction,for example the colour printed on both sides,Special ink is used and imges slightly raised.After this,printed sheets will be inspected carefully.According to the quality of sheets,it will be two results.if the quality is good or the bank notes is partially damaged which can be used,it would cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and disoatched.while those bad sheets will be securely destroyed.

There are still people who believe that libraries need to censor their books. Censorship is wrong. Books, magazines, movies, music, etc. Travelling by using any transport has become in one of our needs, in the past people used to take hours waiting for the public transport, now, we can afford any of those modern car at the agency. Everyone has different tastes, not only in food, but in every other part of their lives as well. No one person has the right to say that one genre is better than another. Censorship is wrong because it limits what people can read, watch, and listen to. Censorship should not be allowed because it limits what people can read. Another good option is give them a difficult work for every day keep them busy, but I don't know what kind of job can be, because a person who commit a crime isn´t going to do something to help society like communitarian service. I start this sport since I was 10 years old.where my father was playing this sport also,but he started it when he was more greater than me,He was about 30 years old.where squash is one of the games that can be played in any age,I love this game because I find it making exercise to all the body in the same time , we are running in small place moving hands in stretched and different ways in the same time you are working your mind in the same time so it need caring and quik thinkink, as much exercise you will find down the road . I'll tell you a story happened  at school   as any normal pouring day  when you  teenager in school never ever end, but a one day was the best day from any  other pouring normal day because i learn how  live as powerful smart girl who used to let the other us her because she want to feel needed from my friends but i did not have many friends in school except  ""Michael"". I have confessed that in the first time I didn´t like it very much because I was a bit shy boy and I cost a lot of effort to integrate with the other players of the team but with the passage of the time I liked more and more. If we did that, we would have to take away all religious books so that no one was offended. For all the people I advise to start to play or watching football because for me it is a very good sport , but you can play a good football only if you really like it , because first football is fun . Similarly, censorship limits what people can watch. If we removed every movie that had even one tiny part that offended someone else, there would be no more movies left in the world. Every movie is going to have something that someone will love and someone will hate. Only if the government develop more technical property,pay more attention to the environment protection ,such as build more trees and grass in the cities ,and set a special low for those missed animals will help decrease the harm that the building project brings to us. People who love horror movies probably hate comedies. This does not mean that we need to get rid of comedies just because that there are some people who dislike them. It only means that the people who don't like that type of movie don't have to watch them. In the exact same way, censorship keeps people from enjoying the type of music that they love. We can't censor music because everyone has different types and genres that they like. If we take away one kind of music, then we have to take away every kind of music. It is not fair to say that we can censor one genre of music because some people dislike it or find it offensive when there are people who truly enjoy listening to that type of music. It would be unfair to those people, and if we are unfair to them, we have to be unfair to everybody. I will tell you a review of a thriller, the thriller is Hunger games it is about some capitals and people are choised and play on a game, you have to kill persons for they don't kill you, is a movie that have suspense because you want to know ho survey, in the movie someone love someone and protect each others, is very cute but on the 3 movies they are bad moments with the family, capitals, Friends, etc. When he was just about cursing the final line he got hurt and his mussels was dying and star to peel off a black matter, at that point the guys in suit thought that he won’t be able to cross the line , but when they saw that he kept running, they freeze the time and run after him, he stopped for a moment but then , he start running again and when he cross the line he woke up in a red somber fluid, he was wiped out from the matrix, he opened his eyes and saw a flying robot, suddenly he was on a wood wheelchair and they said that he would never be able to walk again , besides that, he stands up and tried to walk again. We should not result to censoring books, movies, and music in libraries and other places just to try make people happy. Censorship in libraries limits what people can enjoy. Spent half an hour after we arrived, started coming everybody, there were many greetings, thanks, hugs, kisses, and then we all went to the table, which was magnificently structured, plenty of food of all kinds, drinks, but we were all waiting for the main course, also the food was magnificent, but the best part was when the couple went to the pool, we were lucky we had an amazing wedding planner who arranged the magnificent and fun activities, he said to the bride and groom enter each an inflatable ball and try walking on the water as long as withstand, and the bride won because the groom slipped and fell after them, out of the ball, fell into the water, and kissed. I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens.So I do not agree with this afirmation, in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport. Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real. If a person want to read something they should be allowed. If they want to watch a certain movie or listen to a certain song, then why not let them? The slim margin of people who dislike what those people enjoy can just avoid reading, watching, or listening to it. We can't take something away from the people who love it just because someone is unhappy."	3
392	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Recently when I was in youtube I saw a movie trailer, the film appeared so good and days later my friends told me if I wanted to go them to the cinema, so I decided to go and luckily they had decided to see the film that days before I had seen. Some of those choose America to see beautiful scenery and advanced culture of US or choose Asia to experience ancient ruins. Of course, Europe is one of the continent  that many of the  tourist want to visit. there are good scenery  and ruince in greece, and there are lots of palace in France and Italy. Although weather of the U.k is not good, in my opinion Unitied Kingdom is the best attraction for me in aspect of Sport, historical and language reason. First,  watching Premier League in real stadium is one of  my bucket list in my life. There was a island that each year in some moth come a hurricane this island is located  in a equator then the people went to this island currently but they can´t went when the hurricane is there because they can dead in the hurricane. There are lots of soccer league all over the Europe, but England league is the best in aspect of  quallity of manager and players, and amount of money is biggest. IN my country peole do alot of mistake and have alot of of bad habits concerning their attitude towards the rubbish ,they are always throwing their old things and rubbish in public place ,the governement also cannot do their role towards their people and their bad behaviour So my idea is aii the coutries allthe people stop to use farmland,forest andwetlang to build houses grow more trees portect our world,our homestar! Consequently, the culture of the United Kingdom is quite attractive. England hve a great power in the world since 11st century. Because of it. they have a lots of attractions like Birmingham palace, and a clock tower. MOTASSEM is a tall guy about 175 c.m and his Weight is 71 k.g and  has a wight skin  .He love going to the beach and he love swimming .He is a casual clothes wearing such Shirt and jeans which mostly  blue,Gray and Black .If you see him you notice how he is an elegant . Further more, geographical characteristics of  Country is also interesting. There are 4 country in U.K, and those 4 countries have a different lifestyle. One day Penny discovered it and it go to tell it to his queen, the queen at knowing that she get very confused but at the same time she get mad and she wanted revenge. I can speak Korean, English, and Chineese. However, compared to the line of indoor swimming pool,the difference of seasonal achievement of ice cream van is considerably large.Overall,the achievement of ice cream van is better than the indoor swimming pool,from about 1100 to 5500. But I can speak Chineese only little bit, so It is quite hard  to visit countries those use Chineese. Sundully happanned sonething, I need to work to play my  studuies in the High  school, so the life changes anyway, I needed to stop my favourite sport, because I should need to study in that moment it was more important for me. Athough, there are few differences in American English,  but It is the great advantage that they are simmiliar. my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long. Attractive cultural characteristics and laguage issue is huge criteria that you choose your travel place. If you love soccer,  want to visit various culture attraction, and want to speak fluently, why don't you travel to United Kingdom?"	3
393	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Nowadays the public transporte isn't hardly necessary for our life.However,a lot cities have a problem about traffic,cause of this trouble that citizen don't use public transporte such as autobus, taxi, or even metro.Consequently,gorvernment start to support and take care of the public transporte. Did you ever miss the newest episode of your favorite show? Well, all these things and more can be solved by using the computer. But in some country, You can use underground (metro) , it is very advanced than old types like Bus or Taxi,The underground is faster and clean and arranged . Whether that's information, games, or online friend chatting websites. The computer is necessary for our society today. Countless times I was in desperate need for information. If I'm doing a school report on animals. I can just go on the computer and search whatever I want. There's no more need for driving to the town library and then searching through countless books and encyclopedias. Also, just for young children that are in process of growth and development, physical exercise is essential to do it, because they can have a healthier life.Young children try to effort, and wants to win at this age, and if they train results were better and encourages to keep training.In psychic way, if you are adapated forms relations and create new friends. And it's in your house! There is no more need to search for hours through biographies. If you need to know state capitals, you can find it in no time. Nevertheless the journalists stay all the time having a photo,all the time,when they eaten, drinking, happy, sad,how is your love life and with whoever stay, if stay with something important our what buy. Not only can computers help you with information, it can make school projects so much easier. In modern life,we rely on traffic to work or travel to everywhere.It is conveninet to travel by private cars .The price of private cars which every one can afford it,so that everyone has the private car nowadays .Some people point out private cars are going to replace the public transport . Instead of drawing it, the internet can save time and effort. It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swimming and also when the age become older it will be more difficult to learn than the little . ?XD)Cherry blossom is very beautiful but there are so many people.When we went to Sun Moon Lake by cable car,wind is so strong!I felt a little nervous though the scenery amazing.All in all,I stil have a memorable vacation. finally ,a public transport need more costs , because public transport (such a buses , train ) fees every year is increasing, and this problem we do not face it by private transport , Then, when done, you can print it, or even send it straight to your teacher. But, if it's not finished, you can save it on a thumbdrive, and use it on any computer you want. All in all, that's a huge help. My final reason why computers are good, is that they serve instant pleasure. Computers have millions of games that a kid can play for free. Also, it has many website, like @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, that let you interact with friends. If you need to tell them something, there is no need for a phone. Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe, in fact there is some important tournament where participate all important Europe team,They are called ""Champions League"" and ""Europa League"".football is a team sport in fact in this sport participate everyboby without exclude nobody. As a kid, I'm usually never home because of sports and school activites. If I miss something on @LOCATION1, it is almost definitely going to be on the computer. You don't have to wait a week or so before they replay that episode. looking at the information in more detail.Initially,bank note should be considered the design such as background colour ,artwork,and security issues.then,the preparation of metal plates is next stage.bank note should be skilled and machinists.thereafter,this stage is printing .worker should pay attention to colour on both sides,special ink , and images slightly raised. In the end, I think computers benefit people around the world. No more driving to libraries, or going out and buying games. The computer has everything you want for free. my favorite sport is swimming i swim 2 times per a week sometimes i go to the swimming pool in the same area which i work there and sometimes i go to the swimming pool of my cousin, i enjoy when i spend my time in the water and now even i am pregnant i am afraid when i swim with a group of people i keep telling them and screaming do not close with me ! It definitely benefits society."	3
394	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"You can see some store fridge around the market for Drinks and Dairy like milk, yogurt, cheese, butter and cream Also chest freezers for Ice creams .In a corner, they sell cosmetics and a salesperson helps customers to find their required . To begin with,the format of the bank notes needs to be designed,factors of considerations including the background colour,the artwork and the security issues.Sencondly,equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps.Thirdly,print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink,where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes. Second-hand smokers are the people who inhale the smoke that the smokers exhale from their body. My advice of finding work, is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work.But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase. In a restaurant where there are many patrons enjoying a meal, many of them are non-smokers who dislike the cigarette smell. First, you should know is the weather, we have a very cold winter and a hot summer compared with the other countries in the middle east.If you want a city with sea you should choose any city in the west or east of Saudi Arabia.Riyadh is the capital City it's in the center of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.All the stores and malls are closed at mid night include the five prays breaks because we need to go for pray for work you need to know what the major you want to work in so I can help you to search for a good job matching you abilities. One thousand people by eighteen and more are questions in my town about their way takes care of the environment.Investigation reveals the youngsters are more than ever power to  save the world from waste and pollution. I firmly believe that non-smokers have the rights to stay within premises that are free from cigarette smoke. While smokers have the rights to choose to smoke, it should not be at the expense of innocent non-smokers who have chosen not to smoke. By allowing smoking within restaurants, non-smokers are at the mercy of the fatal second-hand smoke. By exercising this right, customers can have their meals in an environment that do not harm them in any way. Just like how hygiene is of utmost importance during food preparation due to health concerns, smoking is comparable to the effects of food poisoning, if not more severe. To conclude, the long-term side effects of smoking would harm people and outweigh any costs of implementing a no-smoking policy countrywide. In order to effectively implement the no-smoking policy, all restaurants should participate and enforce the policy strictly. This would positively contribute to the efforts to reduce the nicotine addiction worldwide."	3

Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Secondly, do more cooperation between countries.To illustrate, people should cooperation To intervene to bring peace to the world to stop the war in many areas like what United Nations doing.For example, United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy . The government can to improve the public transport making a great investmenting like changing the old vehicles for new and increase the number the bus, trains and build more bus station and trains station this kind the action will help a lot the quality of the public transport for population and will become the life of the people more easy. The reasons for not censoring media in libraries are numerous and include, but are not limited to, unconstitutionality of censorship, the lack of proper definition for 'offensive', and the contradiction censorship poses to the core of what a library is. I'll tell you a story happened  at school   as any normal pouring day  when you  teenager in school never ever end, but a one day was the best day from any  other pouring normal day because i learn how  live as powerful smart girl who used to let the other us her because she want to feel needed from my friends but i did not have many friends in school except  ""Michael"". Freedom of speech and freedom of press are both protected by the constitution upon which our country was founded. Censorship of said materials will effectively undermine both of these rights. My name is shousheng and live in Montreal Canada.Alrough Canada is an English country however in Montreal, the offical language is Freach. They are constitutionally protected in the things they say. Notice that @CAPS1 have a right to free speech and not a right to free speech so long as no one is offended. The freedom of press is the means by which they share their ideas and concepts with the world. They are utilizing their free speech by means of press. Firstly, the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel.Secondly, the public vehicle route are more far than usual route.Thirdly,it is also crowded and no privacy.Finally,there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker. This would be a clear failure to uphold the rights of the citizens. To sum it up I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convinient.Public future unless they have project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger. The constitutional concept of equality of man plays into the situation as well. There is no adequate legal definition of 'offend'. Lastly , workshops about conservation of environment to increase environmental awareness among people to encourage them to take care of their city , and how they can recycle some rubbish to beneficial objects to exploit it at home . So, because all men are equal, we would have to respect the 'offense' taken by all people and to all degrees. This leaves every single work of art, whether it be a book, movie, magazine or any other form provided by libraries, open to the fickle definition of offensive and vulnerable to the personal feelings of every individual. If said offense taken by individuals to works is able to mark a work as 'offensive' and thus make it open to removal from libraries, we are effectively allowing citizens to undermine the rights of other citizens. In my school ages I did not participate any programme even sports.Because school teachers never encourage me to participate.If they told me to attend compulsory I will do without any hesitation. Sometimes the employers do strike and we clients do not known in time as a result we can not get on time to work,that is one of the disadvantages of using public transport. Censorship is meant to create a politically correct and non-offensive environment through the limitation of exposure to materials. Libraries, however, are meant to allow public access to works that stretch and challenge knowledge, beliefs, notions and all ideas held by people through the works of others. Censorship cannot be implemented without a clash with the essence of a library's purpose. It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs.In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us.In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable. A library could not provide works that challenge and stretch individual beliefs if someone was offended by the means by which the stretching occurred. Pre-conceived notions could not be defeated with the presence of factual knowledge if someone did not like the truth. If difficulties was told to the families, the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation. All in all, we can see that censorship could only hope to destroy the system libraries abide by. The constitutional rights of citizens would be infringed upon, the fickle nature of humans and the lack of definition for 'offensive' would allow people to undermine the rights of others, and the essence of what a library really is would be ravaged. We cannot, as @CAPS1 with rights, employ a system of censorship"	3

"Most of the organizations known how is affect managemant acountant practice on them work , therefore they are chossing good programme and employee. think has a future that all people use public transport then I think that maybe continue to have future but has bad and good things , for example good is easier to move in the city and you save time, and the bad , bad people attack you and steal things, but I thing ,that have future ,because a lot people even they use public transport to. I have read plenty of people's concerns regarding @CAPS1 issue, and there are some valid points to be made from both sides of the story. No matter what your opinion on @CAPS1 issue is, there will always be someone who opposes of it. You see censorship of offensive language on television, but here is my take on whether or not censorship should take an effect on books, music, movies, magazines, etc. The first point that I would like to make about censorship is that people all across the world have come in contact with something that they @MONTH1 have thought to be offensive. When kids are old enough to understand what other people are talking about, they will come in contact with things that they take in offense at some point in life. I know from my own personal experience that you will see things that people think should be censored. Although I come from a religious family who does not like to offend anyone, I am old enough to realize that not everything in life is going to work out your way all the time. When you honestly think about it, you cannot censor out things that you hear in person, so why censor things in certain materials? The second point I would like to make about censorship is that no matter how much you try to censor certain materials, people will still find a way to take things offensive. There are certain things in life that you cannot control, and being insulted or offended is one of them. Even the most popular man or woman on the planet has been offended at least once or twice. It isn't about trying to censor every little thing that @MONTH1 be offensive to some people. Maybe it is about the people learning to deal with a little criticism. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. No all is good some people haven't got money can't go to another place to another place and the pollution became more and more, it is a serious problem and the solution is only for the rich people, the solution is buy an electric car, the other solution, more economic, is the government give the money to the population to buy an electric car. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I don´t have friends who like swimming, almost like football or similar teams sports, and always I go alone it isn´t boring for me furthermore, I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I haven´t wait anybody. Invention of car has made people's lives easier.No more they have to solely depend on public transport.Though public transport are cheaper and one could get to know many companions ,increase network.But public transport has fixed schedule and on a rushing day not many can really enjoy their journey. ?XD)Cherry blossom is very beautiful but there are so many people.When we went to Sun Moon Lake by cable car,wind is so strong!I felt a little nervous though the scenery amazing.All in all,I stil have a memorable vacation. cell phone I chose this invention that I think that helped to humanity to communicate more easily,  Motorola It was the first doing something to a mobile phone  was on 3 April 1973 the first to do so was an employee of Martin Cooper Cooper made mobile phone history in April 1973 when he made the first ever call on a handheld mobile phone After that, with the new technology they could invent new and better dispositives for the needs of users  ""taken from https://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/guides/history-of-mobile-phones/"" Many observations, personal experiences, and/or readings have been done by many different people.

Censorship can be a good thing it could also be a bad thing. Does censorship really help in our society? Actually think about it, there is still murders, rapes, and whatever else with censory. To sum it up I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convinient.Public future unless they have project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger. I want to turn to his hobbies, when he isn't working, he is riding on a bike, every evening he takes the bike and rides across some paths for more than forty kilometers by day, so he is very good rider and its quite strong to ride with him. In some movies you get to choose on what you want to watch. The unrated version or the censored version. I played so good that everyone gave me congratulations but thats not all one of the best team of the world wanted too take me. Other people might choose the censored version, because of the fact that they have children and dont want them watching stuff that would be in the unrated version. I would perferably pick the unrated version, because i like all the funny parts that wouldn't show in the censored version. Then there are those television shows that 'bleep' out alot of words, because of course you are not allowed to say them on television. Parents dont want their six year old going around and saying all of them nasty words. That's why most of the time you hardly ever see them kind of shows on in the afternoons, they are usually on at @TIME1 or later. Secondly, my observations about movies and/or television shows. As I told you before because of the technology many things has become able in less time, and with the pass of the years this tend to increase. I do watch them, but i would never watch them around my younger sister! She is eleven years old, I dont want my littel sister going to school and saying a bad word and have a teacher hear her. Then she would say well @PERSON1 was the one who watched the movie. The best season to sale the ice cream from the van is autumn,while that is one of the worst season for indoor swimming pool.The discrepancy of these two place is large.The best sale achievement of the van is 4500,5000,5500respectively. Some movies could do without so much violence, but they have to make money some how. Dear Jo, As you know, my grandmother actually lives in France with my cousint Jonh, unfortunately he has to make three months course outside of the country, Jonh will leave France next weekend, but instead it is not possible, I have to go and look after her because none of my family cant waist three months over there. i love my family special my little sister, she has sixteen years old, i consider my best friend because i used to tell her everything of my life. So many books have been banned across the @LOCATION1, because people were offended by them or just didnt want that book on the shelves just in case their child reads it. ""Annabelle"" is a horror movie which i am going to watch this Saturday.I am wondering if i will be scared after the movie.The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was closed in a museum from Conecticut where she is visited  by a preist  who blesses her twice a month.John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife :a beautifull colection doll dressed in a wedding dress.Unfortunatelly,in a horribble night the couple""s house was invided by a satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them.The satanists invoced an eavel entity that is capabale of the worst things...Annabelle.After Mia gives birth to her doughter Lilly,Annabelel wants to kill her.Even the preist doesn's know how to help the unhappy familly.Everyone is terryfied and find out that a demon is attached by the doll.Idon't know the end of the story but i don;t think that is a happy one... That's why the artist of the song has to make two different copies of their song, so they can be played and so they will get popular. I choose the wheel because is the most useful invention ever because thanks to it the human works make easier by example a way to move heavy objects, compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today the wheel was invented at a relatively late point of human history, he oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia. When I see a word that isn't the nicest word ever, I keep reading and dont let it bother me. we all know that do sport is very important to keep our life healthy and happy.My favourite sport actually is walking;and I prefer walking in the morning and before sundown.I like also walking in public street,gardens,clubs and on the shore.when i want to go anywhere;I do my best to go on foot.I like this sport since my childhood because I found that I can think about my good time when I was child and relax with myself to think carefully about my present and future.The walking can also fitness and do the knee stronger.It would be interesting to accompain your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time.I advice my guys who suffer from laziness and overweight,try to walk one hour at least and after that they will like this sport. about my rest of family , as I said before they are just a relatives , but even if they are not friends almost ,but I do love them to much ,first one is my aunt ,the dead one ,and the other who still alive ,but i don't feel that felling of love towards my uncle , I do love him ,but he is just my uncle no more . Honestly, I have no objections to censorship and other times I do. My experiences, observations, and/or reading has made me think about how censorship could be bad or good."	3
398	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"@ORGANIZATION1, Computers are great tools and a great piece of modern technology. Almost every family has them. About @PERCENT1 of my class has computers. So many people have them because their helpful and another current learning resource. Cricket has become a part of me since when I was a kid.Its very interesting sport.Cricket brings a passion on me whenever and wherever its possible I find out a way to start the game.I also watch cricket patiently.Its known as the gentleman's game.The best part of this game is batting whether someone knows or not he first prefer to bat.Batting has its own cherish.So, I also prefer to bat and hitting hard rather than bowling. Although they can be time consuming they make up for it in the long run. That I want to say, is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb's in Spanish Languaje, just Imaging you the same but not in your native lenguaje. It's especially helpful for work because instead of calling a bunch of clients. You can send them all emails in under a few minutes. They also help with school or planning a vacation. You can find great low prices on travel agencies on the computer. This is great because our country is having a bad acession and we need to be saving every penny. To sum it up I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convinient.Public future unless they have project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger. Next is that it's a great current learning resource. You can find articles on anything happening right at that moment or a couple days before. Sometimes the articles in books are old and. Secondly, it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting a time in waiting a specific time to move or even waste a time in waiting a public transportation to reach all point it should get it , but in the other side when  you have your own transport or a private transport is get a right to choose time of trip or when you want to move or stay, and nowadays we cannot waste our time in taking public transport. Nowadays public transportation is included almost all around the planet, We can admit that the transport revolution has been plave  in the last century but due to the globalization and technological development, the transport sector is always in a continuos transformation: In the other hand we must remarque how the plane sector has been grown, currently is the most common way of transport for going away and that's also means than the shipping factory has decreaced deeply, in order to let the plane market blomm. So if you want to get more of an education but, you have to work too. First of all, thank you professor to teach in the meantime, the entire course of the learn really benefited, especially in the first meeting, for British English, I still did not really understand, it makes me frustrated, but gradually after I found the beautiful of the language in British English, I think it’s all because of the usual problem of American English, and so I really appreciate that you choose simple  textbooks and it’s easy to learn, and you really very carefully and very humorous, you're always careful in curriculum pronunciation correction for each student, using a variety of reading skills let us immerse them read. the most family member I love and think she is the best friend of mine , my sister , she is elder me about 12 years , I can tell her any thing about my life , my self , my feelings ,hhh also i think if i felt in love she would be the first to know that . I like a car as well,but when I have to driving a car I have to think about parking a lot and I can't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am having travel,so the public transport is making connection with human beings.It is why I think public transport is really important for public and there are a lot of important thing is having a possble in the future. Nevertheless travel by car is easier for commute for example, because they can choose a personal timetable without a terrible discomfort of buses; in addiction there is a fair chance that by the end of this century dwellers will stop travelling by public transport, in special way if the government have invested his money in green energy and we could discover a new green car, which in turn revolutionary our life. No because what if that family member or friend doesn't have a phone. Well then they can use their computer to stay in touch. They can use email, facebook, aim, and so many more. A computer helps me stay in touch with people I haven't seen in awhile. Okay, now that I've stated all my reasons why computers are a great resource. i like volei because it was part of my life and of life of my mother, is my favorite sport, but i like over sports too, same i don't play volei because I'm bad, and my friends that know, don't like of  peoples bad of volei.I'm watching they playing, they're really very good, but when play over school, they're very bad Computers are now an important piece of Society. I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked.Pleasure to work at concerts is when  I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate.The experience  is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert."	3

"Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. i love my family special my little sister, she has sixteen years old, i consider my best friend because i used to tell her everything of my life. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. Although I understand her message, I don't completely agree with it. I believe most things such as books, music, magazines, etc. should be censored in some cases. One reason why I think there should be censorship is because of minors that @MONTH1 want to see things that @MONTH1 not be suitable for them. First of all, children often follow after what they see. Another good option is give them a difficult work for every day keep them busy, but I don't know what kind of job can be, because a person who commit a crime isn´t going to do something to help society like communitarian service. Often the evolution is return of origins however I hope that the man in the next years will be to don't forget the past. With a great effort sate down on the grass, he feels tired, and has a little sensation of pain in his boson, site there with many sounds on air, he star recall...his face is changing is dark, he has now a clear image of all, when opened the door of the house his girlfriend is there dying on the floor, Michael remember all, the fight, the lays, the screams, the knife...the blood; but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. That means he is a careless, who always drives too fast  But public transport has advantages: If we uses it is the essential transport to travel. Violence is a main topic  in newspaper articles. For instance, most front page content is about the wars and hostility in the world. The biggest anecdote, that I have with my friend, was our trip to Disney world.Where we could visit all the parks of Disney , like Animal Kingdom ,Hollywood studios and Magic kingdom.In adittion we could visit others parks, like Universal and Bush Garden. Disrespectful acts, cussing, and rude gestures are not a positive way to keep a more mature role going that will make a better environment. People who reach 18 have to complete military service is an issue, the supporters suggest that is helpful for the 18 to train the physical fitness and psychological quality, whilst opponents point out that is harmful for the human right and affect development of the country. one day Michael decided to make a surprise party to sinha to make her happy and feel his love more so he arranged everything and to keep it surprise to her he was busy all the time and did not show off all the week as usual .that make sinha worried and suspect that Michael do not love her any more and know another girl and she become extremely sad and even it become worse when Michael asked her to go to his apartment to make  the surprise to her  but he did not answer his phone after that . Where would it lead us if we don't? Do we want our society to be badly influenced by a bunch of profanity, violent slogans, or jargon? Shouldn't we all want to be treated with respect and common courtesy and avoid promoting outrageous movies, music, and books on the shelves of our public libraries for everyone to see. They die when John was too little to remember and he never know what happened so he went to all the parts for saw them even he walked and walked even at reverse but he never found them. should have some type of censorship. It all started in the Parson Institute in the class of art history students of the race of Fine Arts in the class the teacher in charge, Jimena, commissioned a task to his students, saying: -To Begin with this course, I want to be sure they know the meaning of art, pro I want it translated into a sculpture or painting made by yourselves, without any specific technique, only your imagination, with it you explain to me what it is art. Keep these things separate: adult books, magazine, movies, music, etc."	3
400	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Almost from the age of comprehension, we have been repeatedly told the negative impacts of smoking by various sources: our parents, our teachers, legislators, health campaigners, surveyors and researchers. They are called below: 1- chaharshanbeh soori 2- Norouz 3- sizdehbedar  chahrshanbeh soori:  It meaning Tuesday night of week and take place on last Tuesday night of the year .at this night people make a bonfire and jump over the fires and say to fire :I give you my sign of sickness(yellow color)and you give me your healthy sign (red color)and eat some special foods . Yet, despite facing numerous legislative restrictions and taxations in terms of marketing and publicity, the act of smoking in public places (although to be fair, they cannot smoke inside buildings) continues to plague the non-smokers. Why is smoking so popular, and in so many countries? it can never be regained even the strongest monarchs have been helpless to prevent time.So should be careful about the importance of time .I hope to not waste it and use it as the best use for giving opportunity for rising .Those who waste it ,will be behind and they will fail to make a mark in their life.The great men and successful guys became fame and rose by a suitable use for time .They guide and source of inspiration for a new generation. Joking aside, I feel that smoking should be banned from restaurants. Smoking, or ingesting various gaseous substances thought to be beneficial for our health has been a part of man's history since the stone ages. Religious groups such as the Rastafarians smoke marijuana to enter a trance-like state, which they believe brings them closer to God. In the 1840s, the Chinese addiction to that British import led to the loss of many lives during the Opium Wars. Withdrawal from the addictive substance nicotine found in tobacco often leads to ""cold turkey"" syndrome, in which the person may suffer from fever, shivers and diarrhoea. But, on the other hand, because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable; cars are so many; very noisy, unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth. Perhaps a compromise, such as using a nicotine patch while in the restaurant would be beneficial to both parties without imposing on the rights of either. Nobody ( I doubt even smokers) would like to have the smell of cigarette smoke lingering in the food they are about to consume."	3

"I just finish my lunch time, and before prepare everything to go to work I was thinking of you and I wanted to give you a small surprise with this fantastic photos, I hope you like it. Now think of how hard you worked to teach your child respect and manners. Imagine all of those values going down the drain by them reading one bad magazine or listening to one explicit song. I agree with the censorship in libraries today. Most people wonder where their children learn curse words or sexual behavior and do not consider media as the problem. Libraries have continued to keep children areas clean of explicit materials and are careful so that magazines such as '@CAPS1' do not reach their shelves. Explicit material should be removed if it is found offensive. In conclusion, we are assisting to a new tend in transport, every time, they are faster and more developer, with the latest technology included but at the oppossite case, we find also a contradiction, as we found an other trend for the tradictional transport which avoid the pollution in order to respect the Earth Fdi can play important role in it.It give competition to national companies .By virtue of which they  work properly mannerly and give better option to policy holders.people can always buy nominal premium we should aware them about the types of insurance as well as benefits of the insurancce. Some books could give them the wrong idea and encourage them to make unlawful decisions. Moreover also simple things are changed, for example the food we eat: some times ago everythingh was natural, healthy... but now everyone eat always ""junk food"" and thinghs like that, which are completely unhealthy ! The ideas in the book are either to keep the baby and deal with the consquences or abort the baby and move on with life. about my rest of family , as I said before they are just a relatives , but even if they are not friends almost ,but I do love them to much ,first one is my aunt ,the dead one ,and the other who still alive ,but i don't feel that felling of love towards my uncle , I do love him ,but he is just my uncle no more . Would you want your child to have the idea in their head that they should react first before they think? In conclusion, censorship should be kept in libraries. It helps everyone altogether not to worry about what wrong things their kids are doing, or how they snatched the wrong idea.

402	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"Young adults are people at the age that is crucially influenced by people around them. then when I have time and I see a senior citizen in the street  introducing their scraps bag in an wrong bank I explain them who they have to recycle and who important it is for our environment carefully recycle it Some people think that young adults are highly influenced by their families; however, friends have much more impact on them than family. First, young adults are students in elementary and high school, so they spend most of their time with friends at school. They study, discuss, do group work, and do their hobbies together. Most of young adults spend extra time with their friends after school and during weekends to do extracurricular activities such as music clubs and sports day activity. Moreover, students have to work with friends on group presentations and team projects, so they have to spend more time with friends. A few minutes ago,some boy who looks  like elderly than my old brother closed to the poor little boy,the little boy stopped cried,he looked on some boy,my brother felt afraid because they look like rube,but he still  wanted help the little boy. Second, young adults want to be accepted in a particular community; in other words, they want to feel that they belong to a particular group. As a result, they conform to those communities and friends in order to be accepted. The mas was armed try to steal the backpack.But he not be fixed that the man was a camera in his head and hi action was filmed. One they animals went with Ana and give her an incentive for being an athlete or make something else than stay sleeping. In my opinion ,Volleyball must then be considered among high-risk sports according to the frequency and gravity of our surgical findings.my advice for who starts this sport you will get fresh after you play this game and makes you doing your work in relaxetion way . Apart from that you see new places and you have fun, you also lern others cultures, historicals facts, you also lern to respect others peoples and thirs costums. Likewise, young adults feel more comfortable to talk to friends than family because they think that friends can relate with their situations than family could. Sometimes, family does not understand the circumstances and problems that a teenager has experienced because of the generation gap. Therefore, it is easier to be empathized by friends since friends understand with those situations better. Volleyball its my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I were in another world, in which I can be free and happy, apart of this, when I am bad, this is a distration of the university. Moreover, they feel more comfortable to talk to people at the same generation. For these reasons, friends influence on young adults than family."	3

"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 the world forty years ago. People would need to travel to visit a library to research, every document, doctors notes, and building plan would have to be written by hand or on an old typewriter. Life would have been much more difficult. Today, computers allow us to communicate with one another, access the millions of websites on the internet and help with school work. Coat of arms of the city of Rybinsk is a scarlet heraldic shield,over which - green with golden beach pier for which the output is black rebelling bear holding in the left leg on the left shoulder golden ax, undertwo silver starlet Today's computers allow the world to talk to one another and know what is going on. As we are fully depending on the indivitual generators ,that are causing multiple problems in he weather dueto it's smoke, the oil and gass left behind , in addition to sound offcourse that are themain source for the 18 countinous hours noise. Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe, in fact there is some important tournament where participate all important Europe team,They are called ""Champions League"" and ""Europa League"".football is a team sport in fact in this sport participate everyboby without exclude nobody. Another way to communicate is by video chat. The biggest anecdote, that I have with my friend, was our trip to Disney world.Where we could visit all the parks of Disney , like Animal Kingdom ,Hollywood studios and Magic kingdom.In adittion we could visit others parks, like Universal and Bush Garden. Every month Huang Ji Huang always make a special offer from their cutomer , and for this month Huang Ji Huang will give 20% discount for customer who spend 500 IDR above, for a complete  informatioj you can check it on the website or call the restaurant. You can see some store fridge around the market for Drinks and Dairy like milk, yogurt, cheese, butter and cream Also chest freezers for Ice creams .In a corner, they sell cosmetics and a salesperson helps customers to find their required . Negaticvs about the online lerning are dat your not listening to much from ea real person and more from a Computer, if you dont have any listening things in the app you dont lern how to pronounce the words. The doctors set up a computer equipped with video chat in the operating room and the soldier was, in a way, in two places at once. The man got to see his newborn baby and his wife. Computers can do amazing things! Another reason computers are great is their accessability to the internet. There is this cool website called @CAPS5.Dcotors.Com. For all the people I advise to start to play or watching football because for me it is a very good sport , but you can play a good football only if you really like it , because first football is fun . It also tells you how to treat it and where to find the medicine. The day of the competition and I came  with others  to show how I'd practiced.Then instructor said my name and I went out on the Tatami.when I left I had a special feeling many people look and clapping.It took 3 minutes I won with three accounts too.I was very happy because it was my first competition.After the end of the competition, we were all awarded medals and certificates.Then as always sounded Kazakhstan hymn. Also computers help out immensely with school work and homework. Many teachers nowadays request or demand students to type their asignments because it is easy to read, and it is easier to correct. I also find it faster to type then print. Say that you need to research the periodic table and write down @NUM1 facts as well as all the elements. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of websites on this subject. All you need to do is type it in on google. You can also add an image by copy and pasting; which will inhance your work. The government can to improve the public transport making a great investmenting like changing the old vehicles for new and increase the number the bus, trains and build more bus station and trains station this kind the action will help a lot the quality of the public transport for population and will become the life of the people more easy. Lastyly, computers (and tehn keyboards) are helping people with hand - eye coordination. Many schools are offering typing classes to try and help students. I recently searched this topic on the internet and it showed a study done by @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 that people who practice typing at least @NUM2 minutes a day, will experience increased hand-eye coordination to @PERCENT1 better. This increase would help many, people with low coordination. However,the family is near you since the day you were born until forever.The members follow you,and can based on them.You can tell whatever you want to them.For example,if you are in a bad mood the first person that will come next to you,to make you smile is your mom or dad.Mom and dad spent their life to grow up their children,to feed them,to love them! From communication, to internet accessability, then to helping hand-eye coordination. The world would change for the worse if computers were abandoned."	3
404	University:Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year. Others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.	"The Best Way of Giving Vacation to Students

 Generally, schools are responsible for creating a conducive environment for students to study. In order for students to help, schools need to consider issues such as giving students one long vacation and several short vacations. Some argue giving students one long vacation is more effective. My name is Anna,I am a very cheerful person and I have a creative personality so I enjoy planning activities or organise sport events in a special and  colorful way.I really love childrens and take care of them ,I also had an experience  of working in summer camps and have a good experience doing delicious food because I already did this stuff in other camps.I think that I gave good reasons and I hope that you will accept me. While I were in ANDRAPRADESH every year we have Christmas function in December although we are not interested to attend Drama they were not leave us without participation even simple character.They gave me a character like THE GOD .Firstly I never aware about how act and do this particular character.And from October to till December we practise everyday after our study hour up to eleven ""O""CLOCK.DAY BY DAY  I learn and finally I did my role well.Then I think myself why I wasted all my school days . Many students have a hard time concentrating for long while studying during the semester. In particular, if students use a lot of energy while preparing for exams, it is difficult to keep pace with their studies, and a desire to rest arises. It is difficult to force students to study during this period, so it is necessary to take a short vacation after important exams such as midterm and final to refresh concentration. you are responsible for your workers and the customer satisfaccion, However is very satisfying to see how your own company is grow up and your customers return again because they loved your job. Next, students can learn to plan the vacation in several short vacations. We can not stop changing but we can guide it to the a special  benefit which it makes the life easier and more comfortable.Using the changing method would improve the education system in many aspects especially for people with obstruction. In conclusion, for me it is a lie that the public transportation has no future, however, they have to make improvements to this like the use of better ways of fuel or energy, one way is using renovable sources of energy such as solar, haeolic (wind) or hidraulic(water),Also there are biodisel, and gasoline extracted from seaweed.And the public transportation will be more important in a few years than now. Moreover, students will learn how to revise their plans, taking into account every moment whether they can meet their long-term plans. Nowadays in the cities developed there are many possibilities for public transport, like bus, train, subway, tram etc.these options it's more economical than the car, the problem of the car is that normally the car is occupied for a person, when the car is prepared for to carry four or five people. Some argue that students can study a topic for a long time by taking one long vacation. They say that when students study one topic all the time, they need time to focus on long studies. However, even if students study one long topic, it is more effective to take several short vacations. When students study, it is just as important to spend time learning content on their own, just as it is to take time for someone to teach them through a class; moreover, if students don't have this time, they often forget what they've learned before. Secondly, it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting a time in waiting a specific time to move or even waste a time in waiting a public transportation to reach all point it should get it , but in the other side when  you have your own transport or a private transport is get a right to choose time of trip or when you want to move or stay, and nowadays we cannot waste our time in taking public transport. It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs.In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us.In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable. Moreover, it is an opportunity for students to find and study on their own when they study a topic in depth. Schools should always strive to create a great educational environment for their students. Allowing students to take several short breaks rather than one long break is the best way to make a better educational environment."	3
405	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"The Best Choice for Students

A university is the place that students learn about academic subjects deeply. University students usually focus on studying the specific subject that they choose as major; moreover, some universities encourage their students to only focus on their majors. Actually, we have a lot of problem with traffic: lots of cars in the railway and it don't running; the number of cars in the street cause a dirty pollution;  crawded railways causes a later destination. Even though do not everyone doing that,so how much public office is care of environment is important and this town is care of that a lot.Every morning some peasons are coming park and cleaned that makes feel really thanksgratitude. Each subject is related to each other. For example, both physics and chemistry deal with Schredinger's equation. Students will understand the equation deeply if they can understand both physics' perspective and chemistry's perspective about that equation. In addition, by learning various other subjects students can be creative. When he was just about cursing the final line he got hurt and his mussels was dying and star to peel off a black matter, at that point the guys in suit thought that he won’t be able to cross the line , but when they saw that he kept running, they freeze the time and run after him, he stopped for a moment but then , he start running again and when he cross the line he woke up in a red somber fluid, he was wiped out from the matrix, he opened his eyes and saw a flying robot, suddenly he was on a wood wheelchair and they said that he would never be able to walk again , besides that, he stands up and tried to walk again. If students learn different contents compared to those who are majoring the same subject, they will be able to think up the great idea that the usual people can not think up. Some people argue that universities should require students to specialize in one subject because companies usually prefer specialists rather than generalists. However, this is not true in these days. I suggested to other people  first to understand yourself such as  what do you like, which is possible and than practice after every success Thus, companies now prefer ones with basic knowledge of other subjects which will make them easy to cooperate with ones with other majors. First,the bank notes are designed by consider,thinking from background colour,artwork,security issues.Then,the metal plates are preparated by skilled machinists.And then, the sheets are printed,operator should pay attention to the colour on both sides,special ink,and images slightly raised. By learning not only their majors but also other subjects, students will understand their majors deeply and become more creative. Also, they will be able to cooperate with various people which will make them easy to get job. What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player ,i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families,"	3
406	"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"That I want to say, is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb's in Spanish Languaje, just Imaging you the same but not in your native lenguaje. He was absolutely right and the day of @DATE1, was a very stony day. I think one of my favorites sports of all is the atletism I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself, you have to be every day better than you where yesterday, it force you to improve every time, also is an exercise that help all your body, especially the legs because it gives them great strength, but also your hands because they have to be in a constant movement, and all the body in general because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and help you to have coordination. As I hurriedly pulled a sweater over my head, I ran downstairs and out the door, to school. Running under the dreary gray clouds, I suddenly remembered the geometry test that was scheduled for today. By my seventh period geometry class, the sleep deprivation was kicking in and my head was pounding. Of course, this had to be the day that @PERSON1 decided to cheat off my test. As his eyes swept over my paper for the third time, I sighed and stared pointedly at his own paper. I should have simply shifted in my seat so he could not see my test, but I wanted him to get the point. @PERSON2, however, seemed to think I was cheating off of @PERSON1. She told me not good at all, but my was good and she also added that you may got the chance and finally I got it.After three days later our result has been published and I got the chance but the girl didn't. After collecting my belongings, I turned to go home. A loud ripping noise caught my attention and I realized, with a groan, that I had just torn my sweater on the corner of my locker. Without acknowledging the stares of my peers, I turned and ran out into the pouring rain. Once I had reached my quiet road, I could not contain myself. With my face turned towards the stony sky, I shouted until I my throat felt like sandpaper. I had never had any sort of emotional breakdown before and the feeling was strange and alien to me. I hoped that no one would ever see me like that, as I had transformed into a stranger, hurt and lost. you are responsible for your workers and the customer satisfaccion, However is very satisfying to see how your own company is grow up and your customers return again because they loved your job. So my idea is aii the coutries allthe people stop to use farmland,forest andwetlang to build houses grow more trees portect our world,our homestar! Maybe it was cruel fate or possibly just stupidity, but either way I ended up with half a pot of steaming water spilled down the front of my body. Granted, it was not very hot, as I had just put it on the stove, but all I could do was sit down on the cold kitchen floor, put my head in my hands, and cry. My sobs sounded like a frog croaking. I looked up suddenly, however, when I felt a small hand tapping my shoulder. I had a terrible experience in this Chinese New Year!Because Norovirus infected me!At first,I had a high fever but I thought if I take some medicine I will be fine.Therefore,my condition took a sharp turn for the worse.I cannot eat anything even in New Year's Eve and I was so tired that I cannot play poker with my cousins.Though everythings were depressing,I still have a wonderful winner vacation with my family:we went to  Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village(九族)to visited its blooming cherry blossom. @PERSON3 asked tentavely. But in some country, You can use underground (metro) , it is very advanced than old types like Bus or Taxi,The underground is faster and clean and arranged . I just stared at her with leaking eyes. However, public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a new car and for the adventurer who want to have an exciting travel for then to see more action.Like watching outside or sight seeing,to mingle and meet different people.In addition to this I also admire the bullet train in japan which u consider fast and safe public vehicle Ive'd known. A small smile was set on her pink lips as she started giggling. Another good option is give them a difficult work for every day keep them busy, but I don't know what kind of job can be, because a person who commit a crime isn´t going to do something to help society like communitarian service. It was a ridiculously humorless joke, but the laughter felt like cold water running over the painful burns the day had forced upon me. Another ones which were bad sheets and bad bank notes from damaged apparently,would be destroyed securely.This was the whole working process of the bank notes and it was consist of 7 steps. One little joke, with just one fit of laughter, had transformed my entirely stoney day into a perfect little diamond."	3
407	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear, @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 has come to my concern that many people are debating on whether computers benefit our society or not. Some people think computers are the lives of many people, but I have to disagree with those who say that. In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that doesn't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used,so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground. One way that computers help us is that they bring people together by using the internet. Many families do not live close to other relatives, making hard to see them. Firstly, the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel.Secondly, the public vehicle route are more far than usual route.Thirdly,it is also crowded and no privacy.Finally,there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker. Distant relatives can talk and share picture with one another to keep in touch. Also, the internet can help bring couple together and potentially lead to marriages. you are responsible for your workers and the customer satisfaccion, However is very satisfying to see how your own company is grow up and your customers return again because they loved your job. Another way that computers help today's society is that they offer many places to conduct research on a certain topic. There are so many search engines on the internet that lead you to numerous websites to help you find out what you need to know. Also, researching a topic on the computer is so much easier compared to going to the library and reading books. When using books, to research a topic, you need to find the right book, read the whole thing or at least most of @CAPS2, and find what you're looking for. But with the internet, you just type in what you're looking for, click, and go. Lastly, computers let you shop online and lead to a better shopping experience. By shopping online, you skip the long lines at retail stores which means less time walking to get your product. I love my small family.My family members are very helpful and supportive.My parents are very support.My parents are my best friends and guides.If any problems faced ,i'm went to my parents and say the problem,there are solve the problem.My family is my world.My parents are the good guides.There are my role model.some times we were go to the tour programs,it's very happy moments.My mammy told the story in night.Mom make the special foods in festivals. A person could be left waiting in line for hours to get a product. Why wait outside for so long when you could just buy the product in the comfort of your own home and get the product delivered right to your house? Also, many websites offer special deals for shopping online so you can even money. Let me explain my reasons, when you drive your car you can take it from your garage or in the main door of your house and it gets you whatever you want, but on the other hand if you take public transport it will be much more uncomfortable because you must catch the bus in the bus stop... where is your nearest bus stop? A world without computers would be so much different than the world we live in today."	3
408	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Applying the Utilitarian perspective, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. This is because there is overall harm if smoking is not prohibited. Smoking produces a foul smell that some people dislike. I am from spain so my foreign language is Spanish I start to study another language when I was a child, I started learning English because every one said that English is the future language, when I finished my school time I tried to study French but it was so difficult for me. If difficulties was told to the families, the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation. Second-hand smokers have a higher probability of contracting lung disease. She turned her haid and saw him ""he was fowling me"" she thought""well,I should ask him what are he doing here"" ""What are you doing here"" ask Alison he looks her but with a bad smile,and turn his head This will then be detrimental to their health. There are denying that the environment are changed by behavior of people and animals.For instance, people need to many places to build the modern society,so they fall down lots of trees,burnning many glasses.Another factor that the animals are not control themmselves to eat the plaints lend to distriction of ecosystem . In addition, if smoking is not banned by law, restaurant owners can face difficulty in declining to offer service to smokers. Nowadays we use technology in every thing, from educations to making clothes, we use technology everyday and everywhere.Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful,useful and  important for development but todays generation is influenced whit technology that they have stopped to do other activities. These disadvantages of allowing smoking in restaurants outweigh the advantages. First of all, although travelling by car  become more convenient,   the growing population which cause personal vehicle is hard to manage.The traffic jam  becomes more and more serious as far. This will be in accordance to the human rights. In conclusion, given that it is more beneficial to ban smoking, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country."	3

"Dear @CAPS1, In a recent poll it was determined that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have used or come in contact with computers. in modern day there is very little public transpotr are used,ganeral public prefer much faster and conveninece  ways of traveling  around.though the pulic transport are used in mager citys to avoied traffic conjustion,it is wlidly reconizge that public transport are eco friendly. This extensive use of technology creates a lack in their exercising habits, @CAPS4, they enjoy nature much less. Furthermore, people spend less time interacting with family and friends. These are demaging effects on our society. The island was flood but the island had a levee that prevent a flooding then in many year a engineers star constructing a building to had more money then in the city put many advertising in all thing : ball, balloon, movies ,etc. This problem can be directly attributed to the statistic that on average, @CAPS2 spend @NUM1 and a half hours a day on the computer. You can argue that they @MONTH1 be learning new things or broadening their horizons. However, none or which help these people get or stay healthy and in shape. MOTASSEM is nice and lovely fiance he love his job as he is Patient will dong has jop .he is  a  hard worker he has amazing laughs     .When you started  talk with him you will be inspire by his knowledge and his way of talk he have the talent to Convinces  thought. Click the next link and watch as a beautiful humming bird swarms across the screen of your desktop. You can clearly see its wonder, but can you feel it? For another,there are many different types of programs,which can broaden our eyes,they give details of education,plus other meaningful information，such as documentaries，talk show and so on.These programs are not just for killing the time,but for educating. The computer can only show you nature, but you must log off and find it for yourself to truly appreciate it firsthand. after two days poleas sow some boody in crime scene the poles man ask them what did you do hear ? Fans of computers will argue that they help you interact with people around the world, but what about the people in the next room? Computers @MONTH1 bring you to people globally, but distance you from people at your job, school or home. After we came to the ambulance,police come and one patrol was catching those man who made that to that granny and the other patrol was talking to us.I found out that granny name is Rose and she had got operation after the accident. my advice is be patient, be smart this sport not easy but it's need more trainee, more time to be one of the greatest player in the game In conclusion, extensive computer use does not benefit society. People will spend less time staying active. More over, people will enjoy nature on a desktop instead of in person. Finally, society will not spend as much time communicating with family and friends in person. IN my country peole do alot of mistake and have alot of of bad habits concerning their attitude towards the rubbish ,they are always throwing their old things and rubbish in public place ,the governement also cannot do their role towards their people and their bad behaviour It should be clear that computers are a danger to society."	3
410	Lifestyles: Some people prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day’s work. Others prefer to get up later in the day and work until late at night. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.	"Get Up Early in the Morning
  These days, there are two main types of time to get up. Some people prefer to get up early in the morning, while others prefer to get up later in the morning. These two types have pros and cons. FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY´S all begins in 1981 when freddy fazbear's pizza open, the establishment it's a pizza restaurant but this pizza restaurant in had robots, in 1981 there were four animatronics and their names are Chica , Foxy, Bonnie and Freddy. First of all, early to bed and early to rise is good for health. Consider both aspects that can be concluded that government should respect the human right and set up a new department which use for people who want to apply to complete the military service. The internal system of the body work normally when the biorhythm matches on morning pattern. Normal biorhythm has a great influence on health. If people wake up late and sleep late, their biorhythm will break and health will fail. At first, I had called a travel agent but he said he couldn’t be able to book me a flight before two months, so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent. Although the public transport is slow but it also do not take a long time of people to reach their destination because public transport nowadays are developed more fast and enough. General meal time will be similar to the time for a day of eating when they wake up early. Each person has a different eating time, but external facilities such as restaurants, cafes, and places to play fixed the operating time. I think in the future don't exist public transport because we will drive their car.When you drive your own transport ,a car for example, you going to from a specificlly place but in a bus you go to the bus stop and no to your house or school, work... It is better from the people be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person. this situation to create many pollution for environment so we have more conscience for the planet health However, waking up early can make the day longer and more leisurely. The time in the morning will be longer as people wake up early. my town tries all the time to make our town more beautiful and comfortable by taking more care of the environment,they provide us by good buses which are friends to the environment and offer the tickets for this buses in a cheap price,they also trying to find the best way to make the rubbish more useful by the recycling,also the people tries all the time to find the best way for keep our village clean;they never throw the rubbish in the streets or the gardens,also they take care of the fuel in their cars to not to be bad for the environment,so,it's our duty to take care of our village and the whole environment beside the government. If they wake up late and don't have enough time at the end of the day, there will be no way. People have to wake up early so that they can flexibly increase and reduce the time to play or work. To sum up, to wake up early in the morning is better. They were talking about their lives and  he remembered like he knew her on the bus, maybe  she have always been the woman of his live he looked at eyes and smile he wants to ask her whether now is not late to satart to know her but he decided leave the pub he walked to exit. Therefore, people should wake up early and start the day to feel these good advantages."	3
411	Lifetstyle: Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"Friends: The Most Important Factor Influencing Young Adults
	Aristotle said that human is a social animal. Social activities are especially more important for the young adults, as they are learning about their relationships. Some say that friends are the most important factor that affects the young adults, but others say that the biggest factor affecting them is family. Friends influences the most on young adults for several reasons. At the end, the kind of live that we will see in fifty years from now will have a lot of stuff to help the people to have a more comfortable, easier and faster way of live, but this will be only to meke more money and consume more and more, also the things will be faster of waste to make the people to change their apparel more often and create a consumerism. Young adults meet their colleagues and friends by going to college or workplaces. Firstly,hyrid cars only allowed to use during weekends as result of this most people not using there cars all the week. Nowadays,an increasing number of people are concerned about the phenomenon that armland ,forest and wetland is disappearing for some long-term human activities,for instant housing and transport networks is builded by destroying the balance of environment. In addition to spending more time with friends, there is more control over the relationships between friends. Family members are not selected, but young adults can select who will become their friends. Transportation is very important in cities,villages as well as in sub-lines.Many people has no vehicles,they only depends on public transport due to some reasons.Any way in some cases,car is very useful to reach the destination very fast. By these interactions, they learn how to begin or end relationships, which cannot be learned through family. My town do much efforts to care of environment,they put many pins in the streets to keep it clean also they prevent private drivinig at many days to keep air clean ,they seed trees to absorb co2 and release o2 ,they build factories away from the house of population to prevent respiratory diseases which is a result of air pollution from factories,so not only my country it self but also the individuals follow a proper way to keep environment clean. Wisdom is given not through the long lifetime, but through the special experience and insights. The friends may have similar age, but they can have more wisdom than parents over certain topics. When choosing jobs, for example, a friend may give better advices by information of recent changes in the industry collected working as an intern. To sum up, friends are the most influence on young adults, because they spend long time with friends and they have more control over the relationship. Despite the argument that life-long advices can only be given by family, friends can also give advices."	3

"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to today's society. Not only do computers help us connect with peopl, but think of how efficiant they can be. And you can't neglect the fact that computers offer a profusion of entertainment. So before you say, ""Computers are ruining our society. Recently when I was in youtube I saw a movie trailer, the film appeared so good and days later my friends told me if I wanted to go them to the cinema, so I decided to go and luckily they had decided to see the film that days before I had seen. So I do not have opptunity to practical English Because most of my colleagues speak French.They speak French in the meeting, in the gearm, and in the shopping Many people think of the chatrooms and @CAPS2's. Those are two examples of how a computer can bring people together. Imagine you doing a report on life in @LOCATION1. However, all you can find are those generic articles in old books. A simple solution is talking online to an actual person who lives in @LOCATION1. Life is unpredictable and unforseen.The immense possibilities of life  give us opportunity to explore life but some times   it lead to threat and dangers to our life.We surely pray for the best life of our dear and near ones.But insurance is also necessity and invetable for peace of mind .It gives us surety to live life securely.It just not only to save our life but also secure assets like houses cars etc. I know that i would be overflowing with bliss if an aunt or uncle contacted me through '@CAPS3' or e-mail. The future of public transport in developed countries is very different, because most people have a car, in   the people who live in poor countries, most people take public transport, because people doesn´t have a car and is cheaper take public transport, the pollution of public transport is huge and is growing third world countries should have, eco friendly transport. he jump from his bed to the street and walk to his way to see what he did every morning.when he walk after the stranger man  he notice that he stopped in every trash in the street to take a look and go to the next one, and guess what he saw Michael and run away also Michael was afraid. For instance, one of my friends handed in an essay and our teacher did not accept it. Her penmenship was not legible. Typing homework is an easy alternative to handing in messy, unsophisticated work. The efficiency of a computer is also recognized when trying to accomplish seemingly simple tasks. you must think a little bit before you talk as  one word causes a lot of pain for others for the rest they lives .you may not  actually notice that but you  will feel what am really mean if  someone tells you a painful words . As Automotive Industries are huge in market, most of the  house holders  prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time . Most importantly, computers are the virtual gateway to all sorts of entertainment. Whether you like playing computer games or even if shopping for the best deal is you game; a computer will suit you. after that the celebration was began and a lot of their friends have attended each one presented a gift for Sara , she was very delighted and suddenly the doorbell been rang  she was her old friend Tia . Thousand of website to visit and even more games just waiting to be played. A computer is anyone's passport to leisure and enjoyments. So you make the choice. Is a computer going to benefit society, or will they have catastrophic results. I urge you to remember; computer are a way to connect with people and they are efficiant. Most of all, remember how much you can achieve with a computer."	3

"I love my small family.My family members are very helpful and supportive.My parents are very support.My parents are my best friends and guides.If any problems faced ,i'm went to my parents and say the problem,there are solve the problem.My family is my world.My parents are the good guides.There are my role model.some times we were go to the tour programs,it's very happy moments.My mammy told the story in night.Mom make the special foods in festivals. i like volei because it was part of my life and of life of my mother, is my favorite sport, but i like over sports too, same i don't play volei because I'm bad, and my friends that know, don't like of  peoples bad of volei.I'm watching they playing, they're really very good, but when play over school, they're very bad Also, just for young children that are in process of growth and development, physical exercise is essential to do it, because they can have a healthier life.Young children try to effort, and wants to win at this age, and if they train results were better and encourages to keep training.In psychic way, if you are adapated forms relations and create new friends. The most important step is inspect the notes which are good quality sheets and which are bad sheets.If the sheets are good,those sheets are then cut into separately and packed into cars in order to dispatach all over the city.If the sheets are bad,those sheets are then destroyed through burning. I am here to say that, that is a terrible accusation. First, computers help you with school work. Let's say you have an essay and it needs to be @NUM1 words or more you can just use word cant, then you have the exact amount of words. This process involves five main stages.First,it should take some considerations in design,including background colour,artwork,security issues.Next,skilled machinists is prepared ,in which there are metal plates.Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet).Subsequently, the technical must be used specially for distinction,for example the colour printed on both sides,Special ink is used and imges slightly raised.After this,printed sheets will be inspected carefully.According to the quality of sheets,it will be two results.if the quality is good or the bank notes is partially damaged which can be used,it would cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and disoatched.while those bad sheets will be securely destroyed. You can just simply type in the word and search and then you have millions of choices to choose from. If you had a homework assignment that you didn't understand you could look up how to do it on the internet. But this i just the begining. Another reason computers are so great is that you can meet and interact with people all over the world and learn their culture. You can enter a free chatroom and meet someone from @LOCATION1. You would also be learning about their culture. This could also be a way to learn another language. If the person spoke fluently in @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 than he or she could teach you. you must think a little bit before you talk as  one word causes a lot of pain for others for the rest they lives .you may not  actually notice that but you  will feel what am really mean if  someone tells you a painful words . There are a few people are using puplic transport, like students and someone had low income.in my veiw, i can say might be the puplictransport going to e close because nobody is going to beclose Summer holiday, I have been to Italy on holiday 3 years ago.I didn't have a long holiday ,it was just for 3 days but these 3 days were the best in my life.I must say that I went there because my sister is living there so I didn't have to book a room at the hotel and spending too much money.I went to the Vatican and Rome,I saw their massive buildings which were impressive and their old houses.The weather was fantastic ,I love bathing in the sun and resting on the hot sand on the beach. There are many websites where you can get a live sattelite feed on places on every corner of the globe. You could also do reasearch on the planet itself. You can learn about the care of the earth and what goes on inside it. You might also learn about nature. Because you are the best teacher in the whole world!many of our class classmate really like you too!We know that you are going to teach  Discovery-bay  primary school .My English result is  better once  you taught me I really love you, Ms Cumings!your friend Ms Decock told me that  she is going to Australia ,and I love you two both I hope you that you will come back some times ! You can also got a look into space. You can learn about planets, if there is life on planets or water or anything else these would be things you can reasearch. So to sum it all up, you can get school work done. You can interact with people all over the world. I don't think there is no future for public transport.Especially in urban, for example, Taipei city in Taiwan.People who lives there almost know the convenient public transport called MRT, it's fast, cheaper and doesn't have to find the parking lot. Make sure you go outside and have a great time too!"	3

In case of transportation technology, in this twenty first century we have various option like Plan that can fly with the cloud, train that fast and big enough that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time. From what I could observe, poverty has taken its toll most especially on the children. In England where I live, in Bedford, we use a lot the train to go in the most important town of UK, but the train are very expensive, me and my family stay careful if we go off pick because the price are to high. Fortunately, however, there are those who have taken strived or in local language nag-kayod to rise from the slums. There are those impoverished who diligently worked their way through college to earn a decent living for their families. One factor that enabled such is the prevalence of part-time jobs. The sport is very importatnt of our body it has many benefits to emprove our selves and give us self confedant so we should practice any sport we love because it can change our mind to the better. For businessmen it could mean fewer benefits to pay and the ability to be more flexible in terms of employee overhead. For the impoverished, however, it means the world to them. Part-time jobs can range anywhere from several hours work to several months. They range from cleaning other's cars or homes to tutoring their kids to working at fast food joints. Part-time jobs may seem as detrimental to some, as they won't have occupational security; it is, nonetheless, essential for others and in aggregate, beneficial for society."	3

"Dear editor, I believe that computers are an important part of modern life and proves itself to be available because everyday. Many times we don't even think about using computers, it just becomes a part of our dayly routine. We use computers everyday in many ways, sometimes to stay intouch with a far away friend learn about and experience faraway places, or @MONTH1 be ever to practice hand eye coordination. Computers are so benifical to our life we might not be able to live without them.

In this economy not many people are spending thousands of to go to a beach paradise in the but with the use of computers, you can go there virtualy. I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked.Pleasure to work at concerts is when  I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate.The experience  is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert. For example if you wanted to learn somthing about india, you would dn't have to go to the local library and check out a book, you could just type there are many such as this that give you access information that you could ever need. This prooves also to be valable if you are studing faraway while a paper. The computer is just a great way to get information with out every having to leave your home. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill that many people lack. It alows you to throw a baseball, play videogames, or even drive car. Many computer sceptics believe that you don't benifit from using computers but a recen study done by @LOCATION1 news and report reveals that people who use computers had @PERCENT1 better hand-eye-coordination than computers users.

416	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"A part time job may or may not be important for college students. It may be essential to be employed as part timers for those who belong to a family who are unable pay the required tuition fee and other expenses. The job is important to enable them to continue their college education and to improve their life in the future. Firstly, staff and Personnel design the background colour , the artwork and the scuriity issues on the bank notes,which is also  done in process of other card,such as notes for supermarket.Then in the preparation process, skilled machinists prepare of metal plates for printing.After that sheets of bank notes are printed,there are differences and specials for it, it use special ink ,and print colors on both side,images are slightly rised. The future of public transport in developed countries is very different, because most people have a car, in   the people who live in poor countries, most people take public transport, because people doesn´t have a car and is cheaper take public transport, the pollution of public transport is huge and is growing third world countries should have, eco friendly transport. So, lets start, Most of the Metro cities are now days attract people of city towards Metro only not just because of the fare but because of the time that it saves. I decided and went.It was strange because I never went to the sports.From the time I started going to karate.After one month my instructor told me that I will go to the competition.I was very worrying and nervous. Part time job may cause the student's attention to be divided from his/her studies. Looking for any sport make you feel good and your brain be always refresh so that you  can begin your day with any sport to making fresh and after that you can make any job with refreshment mind. The job may also yield lesser time spent for reviewing and studying. Sleeping and resting period that is important for the student's overall well-being, concentration and attentiveness may be greatly affected. Fatigue and additional stress can be expected by a working student. These disadvantages of having a part time job however may be overcome by the student's capabilities, values and attitudes so that working while studying may be possible."	3
417	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"I agree with the statement to a large extent. Having a part-time job exposes college students to things they have not learned or will never learn in school. This is increasingly important as the working world now demands more than just academic understanding. Firstly, real life experiences play an equally important, if not more important role than academic studies. There was a island that each year in some moth come a hurricane this island is located  in a equator then the people went to this island currently but they can´t went when the hurricane is there because they can dead in the hurricane. As compared to interacting with their schoolmates, this is a newer form of interaction that requires a different set of skills. Secondly, while working on the job, they will face difficulties that they have not encountered before and hence they will be pressed to come up with solutions. This is an opportunity for them to apply what they have learned as well as to think out of the box and solve problems with novel solutions. When he was just about cursing the final line he got hurt and his mussels was dying and star to peel off a black matter, at that point the guys in suit thought that he won’t be able to cross the line , but when they saw that he kept running, they freeze the time and run after him, he stopped for a moment but then , he start running again and when he cross the line he woke up in a red somber fluid, he was wiped out from the matrix, he opened his eyes and saw a flying robot, suddenly he was on a wood wheelchair and they said that he would never be able to walk again , besides that, he stands up and tried to walk again. That means he is a careless, who always drives too fast  But public transport has advantages: If we uses it is the essential transport to travel. Furthermore, they can learn to be more independent by earning money for their own needs and wants. However, part-time jobs should be carefully selected. Not all part-time jobs give the same benefits. People who reach 18 have to complete military service is an issue, the supporters suggest that is helpful for the 18 to train the physical fitness and psychological quality, whilst opponents point out that is harmful for the human right and affect development of the country.

"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 the men and women who write everyday for a living, I would like @CAPS2 you were to write rection on computers. They teach @LOCATION3 faraway places, help build hand-eye coordination, and let @LOCATION3 talk online. So if you want to work in Egypt you must have a complete information about the job (location ,salary,incentives, Allowances , work environment,position titles , company type,policy ,mission,vision)                                                                                               With best Wishes                                                                                                Sameh Sabbagh First, computer let @LOCATION3 learn about faraway places without leaving the rooms. one day Michael decided to make a surprise party to sinha to make her happy and feel his love more so he arranged everything and to keep it surprise to her he was busy all the time and did not show off all the week as usual .that make sinha worried and suspect that Michael do not love her any more and know another girl and she become extremely sad and even it become worse when Michael asked her to go to his apartment to make  the surprise to her  but he did not answer his phone after that . ""@CAPS2 did find out the laws she didn't find enough cause cause she was arrested multiple times in her first few years. A few monthes after her last arrest she came back to the @LOCATION3 where she could deal with the laws. With a great effort sate down on the grass, he feels tired, and has a little sensation of pain in his boson, site there with many sounds on air, he star recall...his face is changing is dark, he has now a clear image of all, when opened the door of the house his girlfriend is there dying on the floor, Michael remember all, the fight, the lays, the screams, the knife...the blood; but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Ten minutes on computer searching the laws in @LOCATION2 could have kept her in @LOCATION1. Next, comptures improve hand-eye coordination. From a survey @PERCENT1 of children that spend more time on computers are better at tennis, and at baseball then others. In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life, but majority of ones is totally utopic. I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, @PERCENT2 of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand-eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more. as a result of this consumer gets more benefit like lower faire, privacy, freedom and safe travelling.in addition many automobile company launcing new car with affordable price which insiost people to use more and more private vechile. no of all people could afford to make conveyenc by car .car is easy and cozy also but public transprt is fair is much affordable to all clasess of poeple public transport means mainly pubic bus.people used to travell long disistance by publis bus .it is possible to carry large number of people of different places to carry in bus. Another ones which were bad sheets and bad bank notes from damaged apparently,would be destroyed securely.This was the whole working process of the bank notes and it was consist of 7 steps. finally ,a public transport need more costs , because public transport (such a buses , train ) fees every year is increasing, and this problem we do not face it by private transport , However, people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but @CAPS2 you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirly, @CAPS2 you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because @CAPS2 you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. @CAPS5, instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. The television is one of the most important AV media in the world.You can use it for many purposes, according  to your needs .There are a lot of channels in many roles,for instance , education , movies, songs ,sports,news and so on .The television is not only for entertainment but also for education .The television can entertain you through it's entertained channels, and the television can educate you through it's educational channels. In my life,many dreams have existed in my mind,which is sweet ,incredible,magical or horrible.However,one of dreams is keeping in my heart that I can't forget it forever. I know that I am a suitable person for this job, and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job, because I have been travelled for all the world and in this experience, I have seen in the necesity on work to fiance my journey, so the I have dedicated to work on summer camps, and I have a lot of experience in this. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever @CAPS2 you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot! From so many students having greater hand-eye cooridination they will enjoy what their good at like tennis. @PERSON1, a professor of the human body at @ORGANIZATION1 states ""Technology helps hand-eye. Many who use computers more than others to be greater at @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and games along those lines."" This shows how hand-eye and exercise is linked to computer. Furthermore, computers help @LOCATION3 talk with other people. Firstly,the growing number of private cars cause the big problem with traffic jam .People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam.That wastes people's time and make people feel exhausted.Not mention to say,it's definitely hard to enjoy travelling in holidays.Secondly,private  cars are the main reason for the air pollution.We should consider the protection of environment for human future,not only care about the convenience we can see for now. Talking with others by computers makes the world go round. World business need computers to contact eachother to decuss plans on how to move toward economicly. Online Lerning Positiv things about the online lernign are dat you are more mobile with your smartphone and you dont have to carry so much paper with you, also your on your own and in your own lerning speed what makes it more spesific on the user it selfs. They teach @LOCATION3 of faraway places, improve hand-eye coordnation, and let @LOCATION3 talk to other people. I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens.So I do not agree with this afirmation, in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport."	3

"Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, People say that technology is affecting everybody left and right. The last mistake that I have had to have been when I changed the telephone company because since I changed I have many troubles. It helps us do project for school, let us understand culture around the world, and gives us the ability to talk and connect with friends and family everywhere. Our shool makes us do tons of project and the computer is our main course. If you want to go somewhere far away, you're most likely to research it, and then plan on going. It is also might be used to talk with friends on facebook, twitter, and @CAPS3. Maintaing cars are expensive.Public transport you do not need to worry about any petrol filling, checking tyre pressures, getting tired after driving long journey.In future cutting down public transport affects many of the people.Elderly people wont able to drive always depends on public transport.If public transport stop services people who are not able to drive will  affect a lot. To start off, as an eight grades, we are prepared to go to high school. ""Annabelle"" is a horror movie which i am going to watch this Saturday.I am wondering if i will be scared after the movie.The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was closed in a museum from Conecticut where she is visited  by a preist  who blesses her twice a month.John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife :a beautifull colection doll dressed in a wedding dress.Unfortunatelly,in a horribble night the couple""s house was invided by a satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them.The satanists invoced an eavel entity that is capabale of the worst things...Annabelle.After Mia gives birth to her doughter Lilly,Annabelel wants to kill her.Even the preist doesn's know how to help the unhappy familly.Everyone is terryfied and find out that a demon is attached by the doll.Idon't know the end of the story but i don;t think that is a happy one... One thousand people by eighteen and more are questions in my town about their way takes care of the environment.Investigation reveals the youngsters are more than ever power to  save the world from waste and pollution. Personally I believe that those who are not participate any activity the teachers has them to encourage .Then only they also know how talented they are.Every student should attend and show their talent.After some ages we can not attend any this type of activity because we all are become old .So let do and enjoy your young age be happier. When i was arrived at home, i was started to read the news paper, so i found from there The International Student Magazine have to organize a short story competition, and I decide to call Michael to tell him about this contest. Pass some years  of the university and he know a girl called Kate and he get loved on here and she get loved in him. In addition to, computers let you book flights, buy, tax rates. The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years The only way you can get tickets is if you go onto the internet. They have websites that let book whatever kind of flights you want. It can be to go to florida, or it can be a flight to @LOCATION1. If you also how the economy is doing, you can look up tax rates and how find out how much our country is in debt. Firstly,the city of Vancouver has a programme called go green Vancouver that it will protect the environment selecting the rubbish by containers at the same time there is a collaboration from the city hall of any district that it will provided a 3 containers for each house one for papers one for bottles y the last one for rubbish materials. Computers can be very they resourceful at @CAPS2. An day in the morning Paxton waited to Long y the writer, but he listened that called him suddenly he goes for the beach and is killed for the shadow We can really confirm that there is no future for public transport, if so, we will have to drive a car instead of buying a ticket for public transport and go to office, city, home and so on using private transport, however we can also think that in the centre has no parking car or it is not enough for the whole private car, thereby, if we use a public transport, we can simplify our lives and spend less simply because we are able to save money and time. Facebook and twitter are the new things of the century. Facebook and twitter let you talk to friends, post photos and talk about your personal life. They have a new thing now where you can play lifestyle games. @CAPS3 is not as popular anymore and doesn't have as many cool things. It only let's you talk to friends and that's why no one uses it anymore. People want to be able to do more than just talk. It comes to my attention that computers have over time. I believe that the people in a future they will begin to travelling shared car more time and they use less the public transport as the train, the bus, underground, etc. In addition, stress is a clear disadvantage of compete because competitiors are trying to win and this can frustrates.But, some people do not think this like this and take it more simply Finally, I think that to compete in sports has some benefits and disadvantages, but when is controlated there are some benefits that help you to whole you life. They can be done only by the help of a computer. You can research people and places and or get pictures. You can also book flights for far away trips and buy cars and other items off the internet. We even have the capability to talk with friends on facebook and twitter. Computers have a positive influence on people."	3

Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Today, millions of teens are bombarded with all kinds of media garbage. This can range from exposure to certain movies, music, magazines, books, or to even commercials. Parents, teachers, and even governments censor materials such as these to protect the students or the general population on topics that can be offensive or difficult to explain. However is that really the right choice? I had a terrible experience in this Chinese New Year!Because Norovirus infected me!At first,I had a high fever but I thought if I take some medicine I will be fine.Therefore,my condition took a sharp turn for the worse.I cannot eat anything even in New Year's Eve and I was so tired that I cannot play poker with my cousins.Though everythings were depressing,I still have a wonderful winner vacation with my family:we went to  Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village(九族)to visited its blooming cherry blossom. In fact, our parents and teachers should prepare us to be fully equiped when we go off on our own to find our place in the world. This then begs the question is it okay to censor certain books from the shelves of a library which can potentially enlighten us as growing students? it can never be regained even the strongest monarchs have been helpless to prevent time.So should be careful about the importance of time .I hope to not waste it and use it as the best use for giving opportunity for rising .Those who waste it ,will be behind and they will fail to make a mark in their life.The great men and successful guys became fame and rose by a suitable use for time .They guide and source of inspiration for a new generation. Not only that, but what one person finds offensive another can @MONTH1 not. cars are faster than public transport so cars are more convenient than public transport it is easier ,faster and more comfortable especially in long distances so governments should improve public transport as not all people have cars For example, take what Katherine Paterson said about how if everyone decided to work in this manner, all the books in the world wouldn't be available to any of us. Therefore censorship in libraries should be condemned because we are only hurting ourselves in the long run when we limit the knowledge we decide to take in"	3
421	Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"You can see many students who are studying on foreign country, and some other students envy them. Many universities know it that they try to expand the exchange with other country's universities. Some people say that a tripp by car is more convenient that by the public transportation, but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations.It is true that travel to a nearby place from your city, it  is more comfortable getting there by car, and the ease of have your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time paying  cabs. First of all, studying abroad expands students' experience. Michael decided to open the door and back for her, he thought better the things he do not want to leave her again, he like her, he knows himself and he wants to know her, he have kept all his feelings for a long time. To study some majors, I think it is the most important to understand humans, because many research and studies are in process to make humans' life better so that understanding human must need for students, and learning other cultures can help it. You can see some store fridge around the market for Drinks and Dairy like milk, yogurt, cheese, butter and cream Also chest freezers for Ice creams .In a corner, they sell cosmetics and a salesperson helps customers to find their required . Education has a crucial part in one society and it’s future and by improving the level of educations system, students can learn more effectively in their entire education life and their career but also their skills will be improved by this process. Furthermore, studying abroad can increase country's academic level. Firstly it is clear that more house and transport networks is convenient for our people,what is knowed to us is that the population growth is a big problems,which is needed for more palce to living.And builing more transport networks is also benifit for us,for example ,the high-speed rail can be shorteded our time in traveling.while the animal may not welcome to it, In these globalization, many professors go to other country's university to learn or study, and many students go to other country's university as an exchange student. Many countries try to expand this because they will be isolated if they don't do it. For example, in Japan, there are too few students go abroad that some degree of isolation has taken. I think one of my favorites sports of all is the atletism I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself, you have to be every day better than you where yesterday, it force you to improve every time, also is an exercise that help all your body, especially the legs because it gives them great strength, but also your hands because they have to be in a constant movement, and all the body in general because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and help you to have coordination. Like this, students go abroad is very important to advance country's academic level. Last, studying abroad can make students can go other countries which students were interested in. There are many students who want to live other countries but they also have worry about it. For these students, study abroad can help them because they have to stay in that country and they can learn about this country. Especially, if student go abroad as an exchange student, they can experience while short time and judge about the country like 'this country is good' or 'this country is bad'. So, study aborad is important for students to learn more about the country which they were interested in. In conclusion, studying abroad has many advantages for students, universities, and country. one day Micheal wanted to go out from his home so he called his besfriend an suggested to go out togther , his friend agreed , so Michael weared his closes , wnet out and closed the door but at this moment he knew he had made a mistake . I do currently master but I can devote myself to the Fellowship Especially since I finished the Pre-Masters and now I need only follow-up from time to time with my guide Academic, so I have the time for the Fellowship . Students also can learn more about the country which they were interested in. As many transportations advanced and many people learn English, students studying abroad are increasing and it is beneficial for everyone that it would be good if many students participate on it."	3
422	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"There are three reason why I agree that a college student should have a part time job. First of all, They will learn how to manage the money effectively. With worked as a part time, they will get more money and they can commute their parent's burden with help to pay their school. It is not only money that the student must be able to manage effectively. I choose the wheel because is the most useful invention ever because thanks to it the human works make easier by example a way to move heavy objects, compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today the wheel was invented at a relatively late point of human history, he oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia. television entertains as well as it will educate the people.These days are educating themselves by watching the television.Televison not only provide entertainment it will give lots of information about the happenings around the globe.Channels like national geographic and animal planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origination of species.Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people Travelling by using any transport has become in one of our needs, in the past people used to take hours waiting for the public transport, now, we can afford any of those modern car at the agency. So, all their time won't be wasted because of doing activity that is not too important or not productive. And the last, the student will get more friends outside the university. It can be hard to meet people when at university or at least a different crowd of people. It is very difficult to deny the importance of family in our life,  definitely families play an essential role community structure .According to the experts we can't create  successful society without creative families , and one another specific part of your life is a good partners surrounding your daily activities. Some people may disagree with me, but I believe there are more benefits for people who work part time while studying."	3

Different assortments of media should definately not leave libraries or be banned from them because people need to be educated in all that exists, they need to know even the bad things in this world so they can hopefully be educated enough about it they can go away from evil acts and help fight against them, and first and foremost it is their right to choose what they want to read because each individual must have the option to be who they want to be. this country are many interesting pLaces to visit,if you wantto have adventure you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza.If you want to have fun you may go to parque de la Costa there are many interesting rolercoasters.And if you want to go the best museum of art in Argentina you should go to malba. Even education @DATE1 is being influenced by people saying that students can not be taught certain realms of knowledge, but in the long run does this really help people? At the end, the kind of live that we will see in fifty years from now will have a lot of stuff to help the people to have a more comfortable, easier and faster way of live, but this will be only to meke more money and consume more and more, also the things will be faster of waste to make the people to change their apparel more often and create a consumerism. In the future,people will go out of the Earth .Because of the damage,people on the ground can't survive.When they want to find foods,there will be nothing.Even of the grass can't alive on earth.Thought,but most people do not be the member of the team of alive.Cause of lots of damage,but they didn't Take responsibility.I wonder for sixteen years.And I don't know if they were change their mind in after the next fifty years. Mohammed is a kindly prophet born in small city called mekka and travelled to another city closed to mekka called almadina cause the people of mekka were very aggressive and they not accepted the new Invitation for the new religio Mohammed came back to his town mekka after that and forgave the people of mekka whose abused him Another point to look at is that people need this variety of education, so they can work for causes important to them. With knowledge people can make new innovations and create and spread new ideas to help make the world better. Although  this can only happen when they know both sides of the story, so that if they oppose something they can know what they are talking about and what they are pushing against and what cause they are pushing for. The only way people can truly make their ideas heard will be when they can understand all about their topics. Some people say that basket it's only for tall guys but it isn't true, in the A league in Italy we have different players not very tall like 1 meter and 60 , so if you love this game you can play it no matter what find only a ball and a hoop and play it. at last I wanna talk about my cousins , I love the most of them especially the cousin in the same age , they are my friends , i love too much ,and also the rest of my family People really just need to be who they really are in order to help the world and make differences, because if we were not allowed to be our own individuals then people would never advance. Without this advancement, people would have just remained the same in their cultures and beliefs, but instead people chose to seek knowledge, and in doing so gave us the technology people have @DATE1. I just finish my lunch time, and before prepare everything to go to work I was thinking of you and I wanted to give you a small surprise with this fantastic photos, I hope you like it. Technology advance way to fast and it is really difficult guessing what kind of stuff or artefacts will be fifty years from now, but we can guess some ideas like flying cars, smartphones with the size of a small paper, laptops really thin like quarter of inch, clothes that clean itself or change the color and shape, healthier food, smarter electrodomestics. To change this would go against the rights people have found for themselves, thus meaning if we gave these rights away, people would have regressed. People should always be allowed to access all types of media, especially in librairies. This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Though there wil;l always be bad media, we must understand even the bad in this world, so that hopefully people will make the choice to combat it. Everyone eagerly waiting for the ambulance arrival but still not yet reached the reason is our college location is little far from the city that's why it is getting late. These choices all help us to hopefully advance and continue forward into the depths of understanding, so that knowledge will continue on forever"	3
424	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Due to Covid-19, most colleges teach students in online, not in classrooms. There are many methods of online courses, such as ZOOM, YouTube, specific school sites, and so on. my English   language is weak , I like to improve it which complete my post graduate study,      The reason for choosing this specifically English language  in September  future I would like to get to know more information about   an English language course . Then what’s the advantages of online courses? First, there are less restricts about time and place. In case of recording lectures, students can watch the video whenever and wherever they want. So, they can control their schedule freely and make best efficiency. For example, I exercise at gym from 10am and 1pm and take some rest after that, and I start studying when I have best condition. One thousand people by eighteen and more are questions in my town about their way takes care of the environment.Investigation reveals the youngsters are more than ever power to  save the world from waste and pollution. the movie I´m going to be reviewing is ""the purge""  I actually loved it quite a lot, I just loved all the suspense and the parts they leave you hanging, it´s just way too interesting, the movie is about the american government who annually gives 12 hours where all crime, even murder, is legal, and there are no medical services during that long period of what they call ""the purge"" and anyone can join it, you can kill whoever you want. Second, it is better to get familiar at studying in college. Students should take care of a lot of things in first time, for instance, school map, English lecture, college courses, friends, clubs, and so on. However, the things they should know decrease in online courses. Micheal was afraid he was waiting for sara to get out he went to the shore to look if she went from the other side but he found no footprints.his mother called him he went home and still thinking about sarah.it was night and ge was afraid ti get there again.he went to sleep .michael closed the door and knew at this moment he had made a mistake. I am beleving that there is no future for the public transpot, using trains is mor convient and low expenses also to decrease the carpon gases which affecting the ozone, people should be aware about the effect of using the public transpotation on the econmics and enviroment, goverements shall encarge the people to use the other ways for transport, this subject shall be issuesd in all media to learn and encrage the people to use he wrigth way for transpot. I used to live for a short time in a place where word recycle was completely ignored but they used to this because that wasn't so rich. More environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of themthere is to that we have a center of care and, other more institutions, we also make environmental protection centers were people can visit and learn about this to sum up our village is very concentrated on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us I recommend people who don’t like online courses to think about the advantages carefully and use them well. If you use online courses well, you may be able to make better results than offline classes."	3
425	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"At first, I had called a travel agent but he said he couldn’t be able to book me a flight before two months, so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent. They promote learning, coordination, and even general welfare. It is true that computers @MONTH1 be detrimental to a person's health, affecting the amount of exercise and interaction a person gets, but the positive effects of computers more than make up for this. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately but he forget what he had to do after thinkig he rememebred that he had to visit his grandmother as she was ill and his mother told him that his grandmother wanted to see her doctor and wanted him to take her by his car as adoctor's clinic far from her house  peter decided to go and he drove his car to his grandmother's house in the next street after he arrived, he saw his grandmother was waiting for him on the front of the street he apologized to her and asked her to come to the car, ""never mind "" she told and ride the car beside him . Among an infinite number of things a person can learn from them are definitions new words, scientific theories, algebraic equations, history, law, any number of languages, and much more. Computers, when used for learning, can teach people things they @MONTH1 learn in school, but on their own time, computers exercise the brain, and teach it to think beyond the bounddries of ""@NUM1."" They also teach the brain how to better direct the body to face i'ts needs. Coordination can be very hand for some people, and this can be a problem. so, i`m rely thinking left this sport.Everyday i get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends.i`m exercising more and more again to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world.i`m champion in my sport so, i`m seek to do all my effort to be the first one in the world.finally I did not find encourage of my family or my teachers. Her mom tried to tell Fernanda that they arrived very late because they had a very perplexed problem, so her mom told her that they came out from the park at 9:00pm it was still late but not too late, so they were on the street and the police arrived because they police thought that she had a globe with wine, and her mother told the police that she doesn't have alcohol or wine on her car, and they police didn't believed her and they took them to the police station so they could check his car, and about 10 minutes approximately they told her that she didn't have nothing so they, went from there to their house and it was late, so that’s the reason. the most family member I love and think she is the best friend of mine , my sister , she is elder me about 12 years , I can tell her any thing about my life , my self , my feelings ,hhh also i think if i felt in love she would be the first to know that . Ferrari making one of the fastes cars on the word, but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac, how they were in the past.If sameone like cars then should go to Formula 1 race to hear the bolid engine sound, I think that is the best voice which I have ever heard in my life.Formula 1 it is also  dangerous sport, the driver are exposed to the risk of  accident at high speed. At first, this process @MONTH1 be excrutiatingly slow, but over time, as the brain gets practice at this coordination improves and the process speeds up @CAPS1, the person will be able to use the computer faster and more efficiently. This will help them play games, learn, or even help people when they are in need. Helping people is very important in this day an age. That's why it is important for people to find out news quickly so that they can help. Hey my name is Joe and i´m 21 years old and i´l think i´l would compliment the summer camp very good, because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak. For example, on the day of the deadly earthquake in @LOCATION1, most of the world found out within the hour from computers. News sites broadcast its social networking sites such as @CAPS2 talked about it, and people talked to each other online about it. This rapid spread of the news saved many lives in @LOCATION1 as people immediately dropped what they were doing and rushed to help. Computers affect people in that they help to send out news and stories causing them to want to help people. Many websites also are adept at donating money while playing a game. For example, www.freenke.org is a site that donates @NUM2 grains of rice for every question answered correctly, and they have donated over @NUM3 @CAPS3 grains of rice. Obviously, computers and sites like these have to have a positive effect on the world. Overall, one would think that computers have a mostly positive effect on the world. When I was young , I enjoyed playing basketball.I thought that it's the best sport ever.It made me fit and strong.It taught me the meanings of teamwork and leadership.I Kept playing basketball 4 years continuously till I joined the secondary school.My advice to anyone starting basketball is to never giving up and always keep playing till the last minute. Computers also help people with their coordination, which is very important. In those days almost 80% of people have assured feel preocupation about their bodies and their alimentation, for this they convidenced me that they will try improve their habitual alimentation everyday and their will do sport more frequently. Thank you, editor, for considering my side on the positive effects computers have on the world."	3
426	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"Most of the organizations known how is affect managemant acountant practice on them work , therefore they are chossing good programme and employee. there was also a cup in it,It said""don't give up your dream,keep doing!go!we stand by you!come on""  Tom love it ,""thanks mom,thanks dad! With the salary you can learn independent, you can save your money, and you can help your parents, and its indirectly make your parent proud of you. First I will ask a question to you if this is your own house,you buy it with a lot of money and will you broke it with no reason? Its make your skill advance. Many on-campus part-time jobs will give students the opportunity to learn administrative skills, such as phone and email etiquette, office electronics troubleshooting, and meeting manners. Then peter stared "" happy birthday my lovely sister"" peter said and gave here key of a car Sara was so amazed and hug here brother and grateful him . And than, Experiencing Workplace Culture Classroom learning is important, but the culture of workplaces and offices are hard to impart within the classroom. Holding down a regular position outside the classroom will allow students to gain firsthand experience in office culture and politics, which will be helpful upon graduation and their first full-time job. The last reason is part time con be balance your time. it can never be regained even the strongest monarchs have been helpless to prevent time.So should be careful about the importance of time .I hope to not waste it and use it as the best use for giving opportunity for rising .Those who waste it ,will be behind and they will fail to make a mark in their life.The great men and successful guys became fame and rose by a suitable use for time .They guide and source of inspiration for a new generation. But if you can't manage your time you should be don't get part time because its can disturbing you. The effect of that is you can decrease your score."	3

Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"As @CAPS1, we are entitled to both freedom of speech and freedom of the press. I used to live for a short time in a place where word recycle was completely ignored but they used to this because that wasn't so rich. I can understand why libraries feel that they need to ban certain works; there are many children that frequent libraries, and having explicit content could deter parents from allowing them to visit. Surely, though, the media in question could be placed in a seperate area, off-limits to anyone under a certain age. Even if someone gets their hands on one of these works, safeguards could be used at the front desk to keep them from borrowing the material. Their library card would show their age, and the worker would not allow them to check out the work if they were too young. Furthermore, I trust in people's common sense. If they believe that a book or movie will be too adult for them, they will avoid checking it out of the library. Parents, as well, will surely not allow their children to borrow risque material. Information is open to those that search for it, and the knowledge it brings prevents unwanted results. They were talking about their lives and  he remembered like he knew her on the bus, maybe  she have always been the woman of his live he looked at eyes and smile he wants to ask her whether now is not late to satart to know her but he decided leave the pub he walked to exit. They @MONTH1 think it is too explicit, but another @MONTH1 not. That other person might want to use the material, but because of restrictions set by the first person, the borrowing of the work becomes prohibited. If you want we could go to the capital city of my country, we will go by the car because the car is cheaper than the bus or train, we could eat in the famous restaurant of the city or we could go to the cinema also if you want I could visit the medieval wall. People know their limits and generally make sure they don't cross them. Abortion is an immoral act that people make as everyone has a chance to survive and nobody has the right to decide for anyone life.Abortion has to be taken seriously in order to avoid these immoral action as these fetus are being deprive of their right since they have already a life.People had to be sensitize about abortion in order to decrease the number of women being abort.Furthermore,abortion is very dangerous and a great number of women had been death with this.Children has to be protected before and after life,it is why abortion has to be stop Everyone eagerly waiting for the ambulance arrival but still not yet reached the reason is our college location is little far from the city that's why it is getting late. They organize protests, sign petitions, etc. True, people do protest laws, and with good reason. However, there really is no need to argue over petty issues that could easily be avoided if people were to just use common sense to reach a consensus. I think this censorship issue is a prime example of that. When it comes to these kinds of debates, we need to learn that we can't be too quick to place restrictions; that we should leave others to do what they think is best for themselves. I like going to the cinema, get out with my friends,  to playing the counter strike, walking to the park, going the shopping and can't stand watching the blood. To paraphrase @ORGANIZATION1, I @MONTH1 not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death your right to say it."	3

"I believe that libraries should not censor their literature, all of our media is a fountain of knowledge waiting to be discovered. No one should be able to decide what is appropriate for the public to know. But in some country, You can use underground (metro) , it is very advanced than old types like Bus or Taxi,The underground is faster and clean and arranged . That right should remain with every single person, so they can decide whats right for them. Over the last thousands and thousands of years media has grown at an incredible rate through books, music, movies, and magazines. With all of this media we have learned many things that we use today from past trials and failures. Media is something that always is around and reminds us of our past mistakes, to ensure that they don't happen again. The great thing about all of the media we have today is that we haven't even learned everything that we can and will from it. Some of our media @MONTH1 not be the most appropriate things ever, but we can still learn so much from it. I decided and went.It was strange because I never went to the sports.From the time I started going to karate.After one month my instructor told me that I will go to the competition.I was very worrying and nervous. Environmental changes really need in the current situation.People contribuation is very important in this matter.The report explains how my town people taking care of my surroundings and to preserve this planet in a betterway. Secondly, the Hall doesn't matter with the environment; for example, the Hall stopped with garbage's selection collection when the new major assumeded the hall. Second advantage is Internet by website, such as twiter, facebook... You allow speak with your quick friend, or you can meet ith them by website, therefore you do not call by telephone, so internet is too much cheap. first my favorite sport is futboll and i like for many reasons for example while you are watching a match you´re going to feel exited and entretaining besides that fubol has the best fotboll player than ever who is leo mesy he's the best and he s able to awesome stuff when he´s playing. We have not even seen half of what media can do"	3
429	"If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Is the Korean education really the best? After we came to the ambulance,police come and one patrol was catching those man who made that to that granny and the other patrol was talking to us.I found out that granny name is Rose and she had got operation after the accident. It’s not surprising to hear that someone from South Korea won the gold medal from an international competition. In case of transportation technology, in this twenty first century we have various option like Plan that can fly with the cloud, train that fast and big enough that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time. But in reality, South Korea is not the best country when it comes to education, if you really think about what education is eventually for. For example, there is no Nobel laureate who won the Nobel prize for their academic achievement. In England where I live, in Bedford, we use a lot the train to go in the most important town of UK, but the train are very expensive, me and my family stay careful if we go off pick because the price are to high. First of all, the Korean education system focuses too much on problem solving. Rather than trying to understand fundamental concepts, Korean students spend most of their time solving problems. But this is not the best way for them to learn something. It might help them get good grades for exams in the future, but what they really have to do as a researcher is something creative. There would be nothing they can do if they were to asked to do something creative as a researcher. In addition, a lot of students lose interest in studying after graduation from high school. A lot of people think that colleges are not a place to study but to enjoy their 20’s life. And since the students at colleges had studied very hard until they graduated from high school, the chances are that they face burnout right after they enter a college. There is no exam like Korean-SAT at college, for which they studied for the past 3 years in high school, so they’re very likely to lose their motivations to study at college. the most family member I love and think she is the best friend of mine , my sister , she is elder me about 12 years , I can tell her any thing about my life , my self , my feelings ,hhh also i think if i felt in love she would be the first to know that . I used my car every day however few a few I started to take public transport for I can to save up money This might help improve the medical system or the govenment of South Korea, but it’s too unbalanced in this country. i dont think the public transport does not have future, there are a lot of people who can not buy a car and has to use the communite transport. But in South Korea, every straight-A student ends up going to a med school or becoming a public officer no matter what they are interested in. If those talented students did something in which they were really interested, South Korea would have become a lot more competitive country. To sum up, the education system is South Korea is not very efficient for students to become a researcher. You can visit old city and watch old buildings and castel,you can watch the beautiful view from bridges over the water.Young people may like to take a walk in king garden,there is sakura trees.If you like night life you can go to some bars and night clubs that are open till morning.But there are two places that i meant in the beggining,its a big zoo called Kolmorden and biggest aquapark in Scandinavia that called Rusha. When you have skill to read a book and in that  moment you are searching for good job you can find  a lot  jobs because you can develop easy when you compare with another person that they have been searched  job to Moreover, all the talented students in South Korea end up going to a med school or becoming a public officer. I am person that like going to do exercise, for this reason I like practise some sports, but the truth is that my favorite sport all around the world is the soccer.I believe that play soccer is an excellent activity, because in every game that the people can like always has to exist some rules. Education is the most important for the future of this country, and it’s our duty to make it better."	3
430	"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"But now I really enjoyed, and me best friend both for me ticket for a theatre to see the musical show ,which was amazing, for cuople of hours I didn't move, was a brilliant present. We missed our friends, our connections, but also places. The place @CAPS8 brother and I came to miss second only to our farm was a @CAPS3 we had dubbed ""The @CAPS1, @CAPS1 @CAPS3."" The place itself was a dump. Close to a dairy farm, it reeked of cow pats mixed with cigarettes. I remember that the grass was perpetually dry, and the bridge crossing the @CAPS3 was continually squeaking; it was an old, covered bridge, and on its last leg. So, it wasn't so much the place we missed, but the happy memories associated with our special place. On one particularly mopey day, our father roused us from our rooms, saying that we were going to explore a new @CAPS3. The government can to improve the public transport making a great investmenting like changing the old vehicles for new and increase the number the bus, trains and build more bus station and trains station this kind the action will help a lot the quality of the public transport for population and will become the life of the people more easy. Most of the time, we ended up miles away from any civilization and stuck in the car with our lunch out of reach. Even at our young ages, we had come to be wary of ""@CAPS4-ventures."" @CAPS7, our mother was able to rouse @CAPS8 brother and I, and we were soon hustled into the car. During the trip, our father was unbearably cheerful. and we must lern children that clean is necessary for their health and on their school they should throw rubbish on Waste basket and who throw it on the ground Will be punished . Riding with @CAPS8 brother and I in the back were two circular lumps of rubber that had been inflated. I would soon learn that these were called inner tubes, and could be used to drift down the @CAPS3. After what seemed like hours on the road, we arrived at a place called ""@LOCATION2 bend."" In this view, I consider, though, there is lots of sports on Televison, they are not too much, because the people have looke for it. Covered in shade, the @CAPS3 flowed noisily, and we could hear it although we were not that close to the @CAPS3 bank. The grass was green and velvety beneath our feet, and the smell of fresh water welling up from the earth was delicious. The light filtered down through the trees and had a crystalline effect on the water. Alison felt desesparate, she notice that her husband´s car were in her house, so he was walking or someone pick up to him, she takes the phone and she call all him group of friends, nobody now anything and now they were scaried. Three robots in specific hour make a show with instruments like a band.Foxy the pirate makes a show individually in her pirate cove, The children loves Foxy because plays with the kids making questions about the pirates and count a pirate story. When our hunger had been sated, it was time to pull out the inner tubes. The water was nice and fast, with some white water and a very little water fall at the end. Being a rather petite child for @CAPS8 age, even these small obstacles looked like the most insidious of rapids, and they made @CAPS8 eyes widen a little. @CAPS7, I managed to steady myself, and prepared to get wet. At @DATE1, I hung on to @CAPS8 inner tube with clutched fingers and wild eyes, but gradually, I relaxed. I let @CAPS8 hand drift out to causally trail behind me in the water, drawing circles as the sunlight filtered down through the trees. This is terrible, you do not have privacy authought the society have a blame, because if they do not take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored. I drew sharp, quick breaths as the little waterfall approached me. The story tell us the story of Monica(Scarlett Johansson) and her routine living in ""Cretacro"" an enormous mysterious island located in the Pacific Ocean,the problem starts when Monica fell in love with Martin. First of all,tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world.Alongside with its development,the ablity of travalling has easened to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another.The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism,as well as with the idea of globalisation,since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen. Somehow, I managed to stay afloat, and @CAPS8 ride left me smiling. one of the most amazing parts of the film is when Teresa calls Cruel for go for them and take them again to the Cruel building and like all of them doesn't wanna go with them they start a war and they take Mihno with them and at the end Thomas decide to go after them and he give a super great speech for all the persons go with them and help him to get back Mihno, and what i really want to see in the next film is that if Thomas is mad at Teresa( i never like her) and if they get free and the world comes back to the normal world. @CAPS8 brother came down the waterfall, spluttering and giggling, and we laughed together. Our laughter healed us, and for the @DATE1 time since the move, we felt totally and completely at home."	3

"I think my town really take care of the environment,because there are a lot of parkｓ in this town and these are very clean.However　some people are not care of environment　that mean some people throw garbage away in the park.I think almost everyone loves parks because a lot of people go to the park and having　lunch,picnic,excersise,nap etc.I think after eat something at the park then clean themselves is good. However we the people have really important part of making it worse.Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh, clean and safe environment to their people.Recycling item can be a good step to start with clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking care by my city.Everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of province government.People is not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere. These computers are bad for people. They cost a lot of money cause people to stop exercising and become unhealthy, and teach children that things come easy in life. In public transport people bound to share transport means with strangers and also we have to persue company policy or regulations,but with their own transport we don't have to bother about these things we travel when we want and when we have time. Between buying one, purchasing hardware and protection, and paying for maintanence, they are very expensive. We can change  everything hurt us if we need if we have volition The reasons for  stress are more diverse perhaps because  we have an  exam period,  family proplems or because we think in negative way,  or we destroyed  ourselves  in long hours of working and canceld our needs  for enough comfortable,  and  lots of reasons to stress...   We must get  out of  the stress quickly before  lose ourself because it's very hurtful period, for example you can read a  book,  doing sport,  play music,  eating delicious food, remmeber  all the positive thing was took place with you,  talk about someone who trust for him,  take off every thing make you upset and make you life tiring,  go out and eat meal with your best joking friends,  and  there a lot of you have to do...   Remmeber the stress is not  lasting thing,  and you can avoid  it  But if you  are willing  to live in happy life. There is then hardware that needs to be bought and replaced, along with antivirus programs and other protection. hello, i want the job for the summer camp i'm looking for children between 8-12 years old i will help to organise sports and evening activities and if you want i could work in the kitchen if i have the job write soon                                                                   victoria With yearly maintanence costing about @MONEY3 per year, you can see how expensive these machines really are."" Good Morning: This is an esay about my favourite sport,it is swimming since I was a child because always enjoy a lot and what is more I can do it alone, I never refuse to go swimming pool and less in summer, of course. Thats a lot of many going toward fixing computers. But computers don't just cause money problems, there are health issues too. Computers take a lot of time away from people. I will tell you a review of a thriller, the thriller is Hunger games it is about some capitals and people are choised and play on a game, you have to kill persons for they don't kill you, is a movie that have suspense because you want to know ho survey, in the movie someone love someone and protect each others, is very cute but on the 3 movies they are bad moments with the family, capitals, Friends, etc. Computers are making people unhealthy. The obesity number in the @LOCATION1 has skyrocketed, but it's not just food, Some experts are now contributing computer use to lack of exercise, and therefore, obesity. Dr. @DR1 @CAPS2 says, ""@CAPS3 matter what you're doing on a computer, be it games or education, you would be better off outside, moving around, getting exercise. A recent study shows that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 families who purchased a computer in the last year have halved their exercise and play time. There are health problems created by computers, but they also teach the next generation that things come very easily. Everybody thinking like the public transport is not comfort for us, but environmentally the public transport is suitable to decrease the pollution and our energy sources also decrease. It is a quite easy to find something out, or research a topic using a computer. Education has a crucial part in one society and it’s future and by improving the level of educations system, students can learn more effectively in their entire education life and their career but also their skills will be improved by this process. Now that it is so easy, children @MONTH1 begin to think things come easily in life. @PERSON1, a pediatric psycologist, says, ""The mind of a child works in a such a way, that most things they encounter are absorted and become normal. If a child becomes use to the ease of searching an item on a computer, he will expect all things to be equally simple. If they are not he @MONTH1 become frustated and not be able to do what is needed."" @NUM3 out of @NUM4 poll takers agree that finding @CAPS4 on the computer is quite easy. for example, lunch time travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emission of carbon mono oxide which is effected to red blood cells and irritate to breathing system. Life is easy, a false statement. the development technology and Industry very fast , so the public transport no future , Must be Interesting the development transport Even fits the times. It costs ridiculous amounts of money, causes health problmes, and poisons the minds of children to believe that life is an easy thing.

Recently, cities are being more and more bigger and complicated. Playing the cricket will also gives physical exercise to our body.we can bowl,batt,field in the cricket which  requires lot of  physical activities. This phenomena is noticeable for the big cities; for example, Seoul, New York, and Beijing are complicated. First of all,friends are important for us,we want a friend that we can share our secrets and problems.But friends maybe in the future go away or hurt you!So you can't always based on them!For example,they need you until they find someone better than you and in the end they go away.But family never let you go or family never go away from you! My name is Abrar saeed Al-mubarak.I'm 13 years old.I live in Saudi Arabia(Riyadh)  .And i'm in grade nine.I have 9 sisters with me we 10 .And 9 brothers.I really love to learn English lounge & French lounge spinach lounge  .And I speak Arabic . We have Eather first than people thanour house.Eather is our home,we all have to protect it.But now people are distroy it.Just for mony for more house but if we destroy it we will all die our money will gone our house will gone we will have nothing.Beside some people destroy farland to build houses but if one day there is no farmland than what should we eat?Nothing at that time we can eat nothing!So what should we do? Human beings have improved agriculture methods and medical knowledges, and this makes the population pop-up from the 100 million to the 700 million. You can visit old city and watch old buildings and castel,you can watch the beautiful view from bridges over the water.Young people may like to take a walk in king garden,there is sakura trees.If you like night life you can go to some bars and night clubs that are open till morning.But there are two places that i meant in the beggining,its a big zoo called Kolmorden and biggest aquapark in Scandinavia that called Rusha. The city with a huge population have also a big area, so people needs transportation to move on. Therefore, the government should build more public transportation to solve this. The following reason for the population problem is traffic problem. In these days, almost every families have their own cars. Without the public transportations, they definitely ride their vehicles when they are going shopping or going to work. This induces a terrible traffic jam during every morning and evening. In the reconquest age the stronghold never downfall with a direct assault, finally the Castellan's army after a large siege force to the government surrender it. The opponents will insist that building more roads can solve those problems, but it is not. To increase the amount of the roads and highways, some space will be needed. However, the big cities have already too much roads and buildings to make more roads and highways. Building more roads in these cities should contain destruction of buildings or expanding the city, and this makes just more complicated city and traffic jam. On the other hand, improving public transportation does not need any expansion. the first day we went to Taormina and Giardini Naxos, the day after we visited Siracusa, the third day Agrigento and The valley of the temples and the last day we saw Marsala and Trapani. As well, we have to promote that the people get jobs close their accommodation or get the accommodation close to the jobs, because we have too much pollution and we could reward the companies that hire staff close to the place of job, maybe in a circle of 4 kilometres, as well we could reward the people that turn their accommodation for live near to the job or for going  there by a bicycle. Then ,preparation of mental plates and skilled machinists are the needments.Printing is the next step ,.Usually ,sheets of bank notes printed ,because there are some special require for the printing ,solour of both sides,special ink ,images slightly raised. Improving public transport is necessary in terms of population, traffic, and spacing, and this will improve the city life, too."	3
433	"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"When I think of laughter, I think back to the wonder years. I reduce use of innecesary power at home, in other words,I turn on light that I need for the while i use it;I take less warm shower; I hit only neccesary rooms. Thinking back to the @DATE2 I was twelve, I remember @CAPS7 adventures pushing me upward towards the sky. Free spirited and lacking reality, I was an unstoppable soul. I was @CAPS2 alone though. Through adventures and explorations, I brought @CAPS7 trustworthy opponent. Her name was @PERSON1 and she was @CAPS7 best friend. @PERSON1 lived out in the country, where the grass grew tall and the land came in acres. Through forests and streams, you could find our hideaway from the world; We called @CAPS3 our wonderland. Now, the small stream with a bridge is nothing but a forgotten place. On a typical @DATE1 @TIME1 in @DATE3, I drove up to @PERSON2 to @PERSON1's house. Walking in her front door, I automatically smelled fresh cinnamon scones drizzled with honey. The sweet smell sent shivers up @CAPS7 spine. It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swimming and also when the age become older it will be more difficult to learn than the little . She wore her long, dark hair in braids and was wearing a white sundress. Her brown, shimmering skin glittered against the sunlight and her dark brown eyes sent me a happy glare. I envied her with @CAPS7 heart and soul. This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. In one moment, she fled to the window and looked out at the perfect, blue ski. ""@CAPS1 wow, finally @DATE2 has come along,"" she whispered and then exploded,"" @CAPS2 another day spent with grumpy, sleepless peers and no more stuffy classrooms or annoying teachers. When printing finished,they should inspection.It the most important step.Printed sheets manually inspected.Finally,they  found good quality sheets and some partially damaged sheeets or bad sheets.They will packaging and distribution the sheets which is good in there.In that time they at fist cut into separate bank notes ,second they packed the sheets and diapatched. We burst into laughter as I made fun of her poetic outburst, but we both new every word of @CAPS3 was true. Sighing, I looked at her breathtaking, dress one last time and ran out to the field in her backyard. @PERSON1 grabbed a red cardigan and followed me, holding a basket in her hand as if she were little red riding hood. Someone was calling the door while that someone was stealing in your house... By that, her sister is scared and woke up...  Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake When I stopped for breath, i encountered the wind blowing the tall, wispy grass in rhythmic motions around me. In my opinion ,Volleyball must then be considered among high-risk sports according to the frequency and gravity of our surgical findings.my advice for who starts this sport you will get fresh after you play this game and makes you doing your work in relaxetion way . In this view, I consider, though, there is lots of sports on Televison, they are not too much, because the people have looke for it. Blood trickled down @CAPS7 chin and left crimson droplets of blood in the green grass. However we the people have really important part of making it worse.Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh, clean and safe environment to their people.Recycling item can be a good step to start with clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking care by my city.Everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of province government.People is not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere. my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long. I'll tell you a story happened  at school   as any normal pouring day  when you  teenager in school never ever end, but a one day was the best day from any  other pouring normal day because i learn how  live as powerful smart girl who used to let the other us her because she want to feel needed from my friends but i did not have many friends in school except  ""Michael"". Standing at her bathroom sink, I wept small tears. In the mirror I could see a belligerent looking girl with a bloody slash across her chin and red, misted eyes. Every month Huang Ji Huang always make a special offer from their cutomer , and for this month Huang Ji Huang will give 20% discount for customer who spend 500 IDR above, for a complete  informatioj you can check it on the website or call the restaurant. People would asked for days ""@CAPS4 is on your face"" and ""@CAPS5! How did that @NUM1 came to @CAPS7 side and squeaked, ""@CAPS6, how are you? Although healthy diet is quite expensive young people follow special diet in order to have better body shape or healthy life.Actually modern life affected on our palate changing .Instance some people who work majority of their waking houres prefer to use fast food more.Our commitments imposes us to forget ourselves and our healthy . I turned to @PERSON1 and in one fluid breath I burst out, ""@CAPS8! Wonderful! Ecstatic! Before this, I had a boring, simple look going. my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long. I hate how gorgeous you are @PERSON1. you are responsible for your workers and the customer satisfaccion, However is very satisfying to see how your own company is grow up and your customers return again because they loved your job. this situation to create many pollution for environment so we have more conscience for the planet health A confused look came across her face but slowly turned to a crooked grin. First of all,we should thinking out a design and dicide the background colour and artwork,or even security issues.And then for the preparation of metal plates ,the skilled and machinists is considerate.Nect,printing,sheets of bank notes printed (50 bank notes per sheet)colour on both sides,and specWell,the most important step is inspection,we should printed sheets manually inspected. Embarrassed, I walked to the door wanting to leave that very second, but she grew silent and look hold of @CAPS7 arm. Shaking her off, I continued down the stairs. This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. @CAPS6, you @MONTH1 have a small cut across your chin, but you have always been beautiful and I feel like a simple, field mouse next to you. The way your blond, thin hair becomes perfect ringlets and the way your freckles highlight your amazing, turquoise eyes. I have always been jealous of you! That's why I'm laughing!"" I took this in for a second and then erupted into laughter. Racing up the stairs, I came to her with a big, bear hug and laughed some more. Everything I had ever thought about her beauty and mine, wasn't at all relevant. Having thought this, the pain of @CAPS7 cut became apparent to me. Playing the cricket will also gives physical exercise to our body.we can bowl,batt,field in the cricket which  requires lot of  physical activities. Seven stitches and a nasty scar, remind me everyday that laughter gets you through the worst while @CAPS3 builds an everlasting, friendship."	3
434	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  Comparing with high school or middle school, the university is freer for students because there are not many mandatory subjects students must study. I'll tell you a story happened  at school   as any normal pouring day  when you  teenager in school never ever end, but a one day was the best day from any  other pouring normal day because i learn how  live as powerful smart girl who used to let the other us her because she want to feel needed from my friends but i did not have many friends in school except  ""Michael"". However, I think there is one significant policy we have to change. It is grading policy. In the reconquest age the stronghold never downfall with a direct assault, finally the Castellan's army after a large siege force to the government surrender it. There are some reasons why I think so. On one hand you put all your things in the car and drive anywhere you want to, on the other hand if you feel not very well to drive, you have no money to buy a car or the downtown of your city is closed for all the means of transport except for the public ones: tram, bus or trolley bus is your wayout. I want to turn to his hobbies, when he isn't working, he is riding on a bike, every evening he takes the bike and rides across some paths for more than forty kilometers by day, so he is very good rider and its quite strong to ride with him. I think this situation is totally wrong because I believe we should study or complete the work voluntarily. Since I think KAIST students are very good at not only studying but also self-management, I think they have the power that they can choose the material to study and study hard for themselves. Micheal was afraid he was waiting for sara to get out he went to the shore to look if she went from the other side but he found no footprints.his mother called him he went home and still thinking about sarah.it was night and ge was afraid ti get there again.he went to sleep .michael closed the door and knew at this moment he had made a mistake. Second, we will be able to challenge more things. I have experience with this topic. When I was doing an assignment for this class(HSS011), I feel something strange. Elizabeth apparent to be a very sweet girl, but Jason is not convince, because when he kiss her, he doesn’t feel nothing, he doesn’t feel that gravity disappear, and when his face turn red, he just put a face of horror and surprise , like if she was very sorry about kissing him. Like the situation, I think ABC grading forced students to do just finite things,  although students can do infinite things. To summarize, change the grading method from ABC grading to SU grading is necessary for KAIST students for these reasons. I hope KAIST students think about this topic once."	3
435	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"It was a cold day at night when I was at home watching my favourite programme on my telly called ""dare to win"", I was with my brother, when we decided to call, The programme is about questions for the contestants that must be answer in correct time, and there is a different things for the winner. Many students work hard for better grades, but sometimes some students claim their grading is not reasonable. In KAIST, the majority of the students consider it is particularly hard to get better grades contrast to other universities in Korea, for instance, Seoul National University and POSTECH. If the  print sheets has good quality ,they will packing and distribution.some partially damaged  will cut into separate or packede or dispatched .The bad sheets will disposal ,the destroyed will be secure. Therefore, I think the grading systems need to change in certain parts. My opinion is supported by the following reasons. First, there are some cases that KAIST's grading systems could become a handicap for the students who takes the lecture for the first time, but it becomes an advantage for the ones who are taking it once more. In KAIST, it is possible for the students who got a grade lower than B- to take the lecture again and make the grade better. Although these students could have maximum grade of A-, I think it is one of the good systems for the students who think they took a lecture too early. Fifty minutes passed ,when my body no longer was sore.I decided to walk to the end.Constantly,I just walked like without terminal contest.While I strugged to walk.Finally,I saw a light to appeare my eyes and I woke up. The grading system grades the students equally regardless they are taking the lecture again or not, and then the system drops the grades of the students that are taking the lecture once again. Therefore, it is possible for the students who took the lecture for the first time to compete with the students who already have experience about the lecture. It is large, clean and  comforktable and has air conditioning and internet wifi  it introduces many kinds of delicious foods like meat, cheeken ,sea foods and if you want anything different you will find it  there .it is suitable for my class because it is difference from any other restaurant MOTASSEM is a tall guy about 175 c.m and his Weight is 71 k.g and  has a wight skin  .He love going to the beach and he love swimming .He is a casual clothes wearing such Shirt and jeans which mostly  blue,Gray and Black .If you see him you notice how he is an elegant . Then the engineers call to other sector to ensure the doubt of Atlantis then the professional say that other was correct. The future of public transport in developed countries is very different, because most people have a car, in   the people who live in poor countries, most people take public transport, because people doesn´t have a car and is cheaper take public transport, the pollution of public transport is huge and is growing third world countries should have, eco friendly transport. This often leads to different grading policy of attendance, and it creates some cases students could possibly be confused of. For example, some classes of calculus does not check the attendance and apply full score on attendance, but some classes apply attendance scores scored by submitting quizzes and assignments. by the difference of the policy, some students in the former class often take penalty from the final grade. Even though students in the former class received better grades on the exams, sometimes the benefits  of the full attendance score affects less than the later class students who got full attendance score. Because of this, students with higher total score can possibly receive lower grades than the students with lower total scores. In order to prevent confusion and maintain acceptable competition, I claim to unify the grading systems of attendance score among classes. Finally, I think ambiguous grading standards must be avoided. However if this situation not change and if our government not take providence about this important subject will be the end of the transport public and will more convenient to use car. For instance, some grading policies from history lectures, there was a policy grading essay, saying ""improvements contrast to the past will be graded higher."" It is not certain how to learn or know to be better, but it only gave the students an abstract understandings. In order to lead the students to know how to improve, I think these policies are needed to be avoided as possible. To summarize, I personally think KAIST's grading systems have several issues to fix. Them they drink a cafe that give them many energy to construct faster the building, this café has a combination for the people can to live all the night. my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long."	3
436	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I would like to say for anyone wants playing soccer to be very careful when he plays it because it may cause a lot of injures ,but in the same time it is very nice game. Universities can be divided into two groups with respect to a number of classes. Some universities require only one class for a semester, and others expect students to taking various classes. Some argue that requiring only one class is sufficient for students. In my opinion, however, universities that require them to take several classes are better than those requiring only one class for two reasons. First of all, taking various lectures can provide synergy for students. Our Mistakes mistake made us better than before if in life we had't got any mistake  we wouldn't succeed that's why  the mistakes are very important in life and I believe  our mistake improve us so but in another way there just one mistake and you could not come back or arranged your mistake Therefore, they can get synergy when studying several subjects. For instance, studying both Physics and Calculus can be beneficial to students for various ways. we will know today some of information about Islam , Islam is great religion come from The Arabian Peninsula and its founded since 1436 years ago. Then the students can feel benefit to the connection between two subjects. We can change  everything hurt us if we need if we have volition The reasons for  stress are more diverse perhaps because  we have an  exam period,  family proplems or because we think in negative way,  or we destroyed  ourselves  in long hours of working and canceld our needs  for enough comfortable,  and  lots of reasons to stress...   We must get  out of  the stress quickly before  lose ourself because it's very hurtful period, for example you can read a  book,  doing sport,  play music,  eating delicious food, remmeber  all the positive thing was took place with you,  talk about someone who trust for him,  take off every thing make you upset and make you life tiring,  go out and eat meal with your best joking friends,  and  there a lot of you have to do...   Remmeber the stress is not  lasting thing,  and you can avoid  it  But if you  are willing  to live in happy life. as a result of this consumer gets more benefit like lower faire, privacy, freedom and safe travelling.in addition many automobile company launcing new car with affordable price which insiost people to use more and more private vechile. When he finds his interest in another field, he would expand his range of information than before; in addition, he might combine one field to another field. For example, a student who takes both chemistry and painting can apply his chemistry knowledge to invent efficient drawing tools. Some argue that students who take one class can focus on their majors. Concentrating one class can let them study deeply and save their free time. I screamed, my anger had dominated my mind i didnt had no longer control over my actions, i was afarid of what i had become and what i could do, but i could not control my self and the only thing i could think of was him suffering with a slow death and the satisaction i would feel when i finally had my revange, the best revange. Although their time is not enough to study deeply, knowledge from several classes can provide synergy and students can study once as if they study the contents repeatedly. In conclusion, students who take several classes can provide synergy and expand their knowledge than students who take one class. Naturally, taking one class has some positive aspects. However, students taking one class may not use their potential totally and be limited. Taking several classes can make students bring the opportunity to use their potential more than taking one class."	3
437	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that the aspect of computers and their influence on people has been brought up. I personally feel that computers are a marvelous tool to help mankind advance. You can see some store fridge around the market for Drinks and Dairy like milk, yogurt, cheese, butter and cream Also chest freezers for Ice creams .In a corner, they sell cosmetics and a salesperson helps customers to find their required . My first reason why computers benefit humans rather than hurt them is the knowledge they provide. No matter what year, its lowest level always in Jan-Mar.May be because this paragraph of time the weather was cold, the purchaser greatly reduced.We can be seen from the diagram,  the highest peak in the has increased year by year, as the low as. The sport is very importatnt of our body it has many benefits to emprove our selves and give us self confedant so we should practice any sport we love because it can change our mind to the better. I know that I am a suitable person for this job, and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job, because I have been travelled for all the world and in this experience, I have seen in the necesity on work to fiance my journey, so the I have dedicated to work on summer camps, and I have a lot of experience in this. Take for example two students, one with a conputer are without. Both are given an assignment to write a report on a famous person. The one with the computer logs any searches for the reason, and in seconds has enough information to write numerous reports. He aces the reports, and continues to use this method. For other hand, People make other inventions for improving the world and reduce pollution, for example, In this time we have created electric cars or organic food, these things are very useful in future, because we will need to reduce pollution. Everybody thinking like the public transport is not comfort for us, but environmentally the public transport is suitable to decrease the pollution and our energy sources also decrease. After spending an hour walking there, he learns that all the books on thet person are checkedout. last summer i worked at cinema.i think it is a very good job because you can see any films you like for free.The minus of this work is very big salary and i think that i will work at this cinema on the next summer. He fails the test, fails the grade, drops out of school, and works ot a @ORGANIZATION1 his entire life. See how much of a different a computer can make? My second reason is that, even though computers are often thought of as destroying @CAPS2, @CAPS3 can build social lives. We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben, which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye.To got to the Big Ben we took the underground, but to get to the London Eye a red bus.After 3 days we went home.I forgot to tell you something about homeless people.A lot of people are homeless, which is sad, but maybe we can change it. Some people @MONTH1 that this is and leads to , but anyone who has basic knowledge knows not to information. Dear USA Summer camp I reply to your advertisement for work with children this summer in summer camps, have looked after children aged 5-10 and it was a fantastic experience, worked at school in north Africa like a volunteer and learnt a lot about children,  think that i'm a suitable person for the job because use to be an energetic and cheerful person and very hardworking, love working with children and  like organising several types of activities, I'm not very good cooking but i can learn very fast. all my class called me creep ugly geek but still little good only when a teacher want from them a research or the exams are next couple days but Michael trying to stop me doing that because they never become my friends and i was bigger to do this things ;    that day i just finish help younger student to understand his  math lesson  My friend Michael asked me to do the same to give her answer sheet for all final exams i was in bi shook why she  want that from me  any way i collect my courage told her that was wrong and become to do that in college better to start study  now and I'll help her to study the hard lessons (i was very sad to say no & she asked me that)she become very angry and told me i should help her because we she was my best Friend then i told her that why i told her NO and she told me i hate you Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Having differently finding specific information? Just post a question on a public site use people with first hand experience will answer @CAPS2 with all the detail you need and more. Say that somebody wants to be a writter, but needs to know how the writing system works, how to set a job in @CAPS2, what the pay is, etc. He searches the internet, but only finds job applications and college ady so he asks the questions on a public site. Someone who has been a write their whole lives checks out the question, and answers @CAPS2 ion great detail. as a result of this consumer gets more benefit like lower faire, privacy, freedom and safe travelling.in addition many automobile company launcing new car with affordable price which insiost people to use more and more private vechile. My final reason is the entertainment computer provide you can play games, watch movies or homemade videos, and even talk to friends. Computers allow you to access thousands of free services to benefit you. Sitting in your room, bored? Why not play a game on your computer. Tired of @CAPS4.V movies? Secondly, do more cooperation between countries.To illustrate, people should cooperation To intervene to bring peace to the world to stop the war in many areas like what United Nations doing.For example, United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy . Go to the computer and have an infinite video library at your dipasle. Lonely? Go to a social website and strike up a conversation. @CAPS2 has infinite entertainment, right at your finger-tips. In conclusion, I believe that compkuters is no limit to what you can do with a computer, as long as you have the imagination. Computers were invented to benefit mankind, not hurting and they are doing a great job."	3
438	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Whether smoking should be banned at all restaurants has become a controversial issue, arousing great public concern. Personally, I think it is an important behavior to ban smoke at restaurant and we should not allow this condition in the restaurant any more. First and foremost, there's no denying that smoking does harm to the smokers and in the meantime to others. He seems different, she never imagined that Jason can be like that, she fantasy with someone, brave and strong, and she never foresees something like this, but she feel something for him, maybe she is in love with this guy . Everybody thinking like the public transport is not comfort for us, but environmentally the public transport is suitable to decrease the pollution and our energy sources also decrease. Non- smokers don't want to get harmed by the cigarette smoke in the restaurants. That was me, I never liked studying, I never found myself in those subjects, but it wasn't the big deal to me, I hated is being seen as unsuccessful or a loser, as I wasn't that, I knew that I'm clever enough to study all these subjects and do well in exams so I can get high marks but they're all didn't get that, they judged me for my marks but marks don't form brains or thoughts, marks isn't the only way that makes you great now and then in the future. Therefore, I suggest that the government should create a place especially for the smokers and the problem will be solved gradually. Last but not least, educated as most Chinese people are, it is crucial for us to behave formally and gently in public. In summary, taking many factors into consideration, I hope that this phenomenon will disappear after so many people's combat. Besides, our government had better take actions to protect the environment at restaurant and solve the problem as soon as possible."	3

"More environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of themthere is to that we have a center of care and, other more institutions, we also make environmental protection centers were people can visit and learn about this to sum up our village is very concentrated on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us Online Lerning Positiv things about the online lernign are dat you are more mobile with your smartphone and you dont have to carry so much paper with you, also your on your own and in your own lerning speed what makes it more spesific on the user it selfs. In this view, I consider, though, there is lots of sports on Televison, they are not too much, because the people have looke for it. I like a car as well,but when I have to driving a car I have to think about parking a lot and I can't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am having travel,so the public transport is making connection with human beings.It is why I think public transport is really important for public and there are a lot of important thing is having a possble in the future. It has weak approaches towards the international community. I have met some university students who do not know the rules of the country and have suffered a lot because of this. I myself have faced problems that I would not face if anybody told me before. The other chart is about employer support, under 26 years old is the most higterst because it almost have 70%, the scentd higterst is age 26-29 years old; it has 50% of people are taken; niy yhe most lower is 35% age of group are 30-39 years old. The first reason is that many foreign students faced problems regarding VISA extension and related immigration problems. I can present myself as a compelling example of this. I was fined around 400 US dollars for not changing my D-4 VISA to D-2  VISA on time. I would have not paid this amount of money if I was informed about this before by KAIST. As a student, any foreign national who faces such kind of problem would not quickly recover from the financial crisis created by such havoc. But we don't have forgotten the cotamination by cars, We can use more the bicycle or public transportetion. The second reason is that  internationals feel isolated in the university. One of the main reasons for this is the language barrier. There is an outcry of loneliness and dissatisfaction from the international students on the anonymous Facebook page. Encourging students to engage in cultural events and to practice their Korean language would solve this problem. Moreover, creating a strong tie between international students and domestic students plays a vital role in creating a harmonious university environment. To our relief,she was saved and when we went to granny room,we saw smile on her face.We were also happy,but in Michael head came a lot of things.He knew that if we escape at that moment when the granny was at the ground,she would most probably die.Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. In modern life,we rely on traffic to work or travel to everywhere.It is conveninet to travel by private cars .The price of private cars which every one can afford it,so that everyone has the private car nowadays .Some people point out private cars are going to replace the public transport . To sum up, If I get an opportunity to change one thing about KIAST  I would improve the university's image  in the mind of international students. There are many accidentally problems encountered by international students studying in Australia.It is believed that the most important one of the problem is culture barrier.Because of different culture backgrounds,the talking  style of internaional students who come from different countries are various. Moreover, some international students have had a hard time intermingling with domestic students due to the cultural difference and language barrier. Hence, this problem needs immediate action, and the best measure is to create groups or clubs that exclusively work on such issues."	3
440	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"      I think my university has a great system of education, welfare, etc. So I am very satisfied with my school life. Often the evolution is return of origins however I hope that the man in the next years will be to don't forget the past. The sport is very importatnt of our body it has many benefits to emprove our selves and give us self confedant so we should practice any sport we love because it can change our mind to the better. my favourite sport is swimming , it makes me feeling comfortable and left me in a good mood , i go to swim twice a week , and my advice to anyone want to start to enjoy every moment of it I have confessed that in the first time I didn´t like it very much because I was a bit shy boy and I cost a lot of effort to integrate with the other players of the team but with the passage of the time I liked more and more. First, the bathrooms in the unremodeled dormitories are uncomfortable. Since they are old building, the bathrooms are also not clean. I don't think there is no future for public transport.Especially in urban, for example, Taipei city in Taiwan.People who lives there almost know the convenient public transport called MRT, it's fast, cheaper and doesn't have to find the parking lot. Personally I believe that those who are not participate any activity the teachers has them to encourage .Then only they also know how talented they are.Every student should attend and show their talent.After some ages we can not attend any this type of activity because we all are become old .So let do and enjoy your young age be happier. i think that this is the guestion for every one, and the answer can't be one for all, cause, someone can use public transport, and economy by this not only money, but and the environment, but some people don't like to use p.t., cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple don't like to travell with another people. At that time, I had a lot of inconvenience using the dormitory. Now, I live in the remodeled 'Sarang' dormitory. I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked.Pleasure to work at concerts is when  I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate.The experience  is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert. Therefore, I think dormitories that have not yet been remodeled should be remodeled as soon as possible for the convenience of students. Second, the dormitories are not soundproof. There are many students living in dormitories and their lifestyles will be different. Some students go to bed early and others stay up late. For example, when I lay down to sleep, I often heard other students talking or walking around so well that it was hard to fall asleep. The dormitory that I am using now has been remodeled, but I don't think the soundproofing problem has been solved. They are called below: 1- chaharshanbeh soori 2- Norouz 3- sizdehbedar  chahrshanbeh soori:  It meaning Tuesday night of week and take place on last Tuesday night of the year .at this night people make a bonfire and jump over the fires and say to fire :I give you my sign of sickness(yellow color)and you give me your healthy sign (red color)and eat some special foods . I heard that there are many dormitories that have not been remodeled yet. There are inconvenience such as toilets and soundproofing problems in using unremodeled dormitories. So, if I could change one important thing about my university, I would remodel the dormitories for the convenience of students."	3
441	Government: Some people think that governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology. Other people disagree and think that this money should be spent on more basic needs. Which of these opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Computer technology changed the world. firstly, that private transport provide a comfortable mean to travelling from one place to another without sharing stranger people a way and by using this kind of transport also comfortable in free with choosing time of a trip. In my opinion, governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology for various reasons. First of all, computer technology itself is one of the basic needs in modern society. That was me, I never liked studying, I never found myself in those subjects, but it wasn't the big deal to me, I hated is being seen as unsuccessful or a loser, as I wasn't that, I knew that I'm clever enough to study all these subjects and do well in exams so I can get high marks but they're all didn't get that, they judged me for my marks but marks don't form brains or thoughts, marks isn't the only way that makes you great now and then in the future. On the other hand, a laptop, a smartphone or paying internet bill is quite expensive especially for low-income families. Some public transports  as trains do not contaminate as cars or motorbikes.Many people said that public transport is not confortable, thats true, from my point of view bus is not so unconfortable. public transport has a big role in transportation specially in large cities like Capital city of countries,  using the car some times causes traffic jam if all person uses their own car, to avoid this a good roadways is needed, also the cost of public transportation is lower than private transportation. Recently, getting a job is very hard to achieve; it is a big social problem that government should solve. Developing computer technology is one of the best choice to make new occupations without destroying environments. Some argue that developing computer technology over other countries is waste of money. According to their opinion, it is enough to catch up recent computer technology in leading countries to use modern advantages. However, investing on computer technology has big potential in the future. For example,  South Korea government had invested significant budget on fast internet during 2000s. As a result, South Korea is not only strong on computer technology, but also strong in cultural impact thanks to quicker exchange of information. To sum up, it is necessary to invest on computer technology since it is one of the basic needs, it makes new occupations, and it gives big potential in the future. Government should pay attention to computer technology, and invest more on it."	3.5
442	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Click, click, click the mouse of a computer goes as you are searhcing throughout the internet. Computers are a great way to teach kids how to be social, make people more intellegent, and help you with your homework, I believe that computers have a very positivr effect on people. although traveling by car is really interesting but still using public transport has its advantages ,by using public transport you're saving  effort when  driving a car for along distance you will get tired , some people don't have enough money to buy their own car . Hi,I am Amy.I would like to spend two months studying in English,two months doing volunteering in children charity and the least two months travelling in UK.What do you think of my plan?I will not only improve my English skills but also devote myself to get along with children.The most important of all,I will take an adventure to the unknown place in UK.I am looking forward to seeing you soon.I would like to invite you to join the road trip with me.it must be an amazing experience if we are together for this trip.As long as you can go with me just let me know. Once they feels more comfoatable, then they can start talking to the person on the phone or in person. For example, I once @MONTH1 this girl who was very sweet, but was painfully shy and everyone for it, so one day she decided to make an aim nad talk to poeple on it, and provove that she isn'e a annoying wherd girl that everyone makes her out to be. She turned out to be one of the nicestly funniest person I ahve hung out with in a while. Which how internet can help you. HAve you ever felt that computers sometimes make you more intellegent? Well, in my opinion I think that computers help out so much more than a book. If you want information its just about typing some keys and a click of a button. All this will help people to live easily, but only to have more time to work, because the type of mind that reign that time will focus in the companies and make money and spend it, this is the reason why a lot of jobs are changing to a home office and the firms are giving more and more facilities to their employees to be more efficient. A lot of people these days study from the internet, I know I sure do. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 more people say, that computers are more helpful than books and can make you a lot more intellegent, because the internet has so much more deatil than books, and mor efacts. Although healthy diet is quite expensive young people follow special diet in order to have better body shape or healthy life.Actually modern life affected on our palate changing .Instance some people who work majority of their waking houres prefer to use fast food more.Our commitments imposes us to forget ourselves and our healthy . Computers is a great tool to use while you are doing your homework. First of all,tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world.Alongside with its development,the ablity of travalling has easened to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another.The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism,as well as with the idea of globalisation,since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen. For example, say you have a report and you need facts on @CAPS1 @PERSON1, and where he was born. So for finish competition with pleasure I needed work out plan witch is diary day by day about our jogging distance, time, mood during work out. and born! There it is with the date exactly. Also if you having a piece of writing like your rough draft so why spend the time trying to write really neat and perfect? When you can just open up a word document and type it up. To sum everything up computers have deffenatly a positive effect on people from these three reasons, computers are a great way to teach kids hohw to be social, make people more intellegent, and help you with your homework, But I understand where your coming from people are spending way to much time on their computer and less time exersising, but you can look up great ways to exersise on the internet and watch videos of people that have @CAPS2.V shows about exersising and do it with them on the computer. Remember, computers aren'@CAPS2 just a waste of time and way to will your brain cells. they have a very positive effect on you."	3.5

Other people disagree and think that this money should be spent on more basic needs. Which of these opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Investments in Computer Technology is Not the Only Thing to Care About. As technology is getting more important these days, people's interest is gathering in developing technologies. Especially, computer technology is taking a large part in the electronics industry and necessary for our daily life; however, it does not mean that governments should use all the money in computer technology. public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it is kind of becoming cheaper and also more safe but some  people prefer cars to extent do we agree with and what is our reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay  before about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was not even good facility to move from place to other and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans at the beginning the faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve it by the end nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and planes .some people prefer cars because the do like crowded places or because the find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places  to summaries it is different from some oneis opinion to another i predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end cars will disappear and will will no longer be used First of all, there is no reason for computers when people do not know how to use it. People who are old or living in a poor village did not have chances to use recent electronic devices; therefore, even if governments bought and gave computers to these people, they would not know how to use it. in a car accident , when she her what happened with her brother she was so nervous then the miracle happened she found a big suitcase in the train she decided to open the bag because no one was in the train so she opened the bag she surprised when she saw  a lot of money inside the bag  . In addition to the need for education, computers are not everything in our life. Food, clothing, and shelter are the basics of life which is the most important thing in life that needs to be achieved first. There are lots of people who do not have something to eat or somewhere to live. Governments should primarily use the money for the ones that lack basic needs. But why public transport have no future to stand and keep going?, that's because of the people that changing their mind, they start like having their own way to travel, Privacy also an important reason, people need to have a private means of transportation. Those who have the money to buy the result of developed technology will earn more money while the poor suffer from a lack of technology which will result in polarization of wealth. To sum up, trying to spend money as much as possible on the computer will only result in the polarization of the wealth and pain of the poor. In my opinion ,Volleyball must then be considered among high-risk sports according to the frequency and gravity of our surgical findings.my advice for who starts this sport you will get fresh after you play this game and makes you doing your work in relaxetion way ."	3.5
444	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"Her sons have a problem they cant see the natural light and one they Grace got up because her children were shouting and crying so she went to their bedroom and the courtins was not there so she go to the other room and the courtins also were not there so she stars getting nervous and more nervous so she go and talk to the servants, so she got very angry and she told them go out of my house and they did not care so she pick up a gun and the old lady returned her keys. Different people have various opinions on this issue. Some people think that it is a golden chance for college students to practise themselves, while others believe that it is a waste of time to do a part-time job. As for me, I feel that a part-time job does more good than harm. Generally speaking, it's important for college students to have a part-job. To begin with, a part-time job will bring more social experience. Those who have a part-time job are more likely to get in touch with various people in society. They can learn how to get along with different people and solve a problem in a short time. It's not hard for us to find that the students with a part-time job are more active and efficient in both study and work. First of all,swim can help your health.The research declined that swim can decrease disease.Second,swim can relax yourself.When you in the water,you will feel relax.Third,swim can get more friend.You can go to the swimming club,that is a way to meet people with interesting of same.You can try this sport from now on. On condition that they would liketo do a job, they must talk to their workmates and cooperate with them. However, compared to the line of indoor swimming pool,the difference of seasonal achievement of ice cream van is considerably large.Overall,the achievement of ice cream van is better than the indoor swimming pool,from about 1100 to 5500. However, on the other hand, if one spends so much time on a part-time job that it affects his study. Then he should decrease the time on it or give it up, for our main duty is to study well, not to earn money at present. When I was returning from syleth I called the girl and talk to her and assure that I got chance in university but girl says that she knew it."	3.5
445	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"KAIST, which stands for Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, is the best university in the area of science and technology in Korea. At KAIST, it is true that all students must speak in English at almost every lecture. In my opinion, it is not proper to use English at KAIST. According to the information donne, the most used is the car thus most of the families has one, but the public transportation is getting more and more common for those ones who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectfully with the planet. First of all, KAIST students do not have enough English skills. English is not Korean mother language. ""Annabelle"" is a horror movie which i am going to watch this Saturday.I am wondering if i will be scared after the movie.The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was closed in a museum from Conecticut where she is visited  by a preist  who blesses her twice a month.John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife :a beautifull colection doll dressed in a wedding dress.Unfortunatelly,in a horribble night the couple""s house was invided by a satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them.The satanists invoced an eavel entity that is capabale of the worst things...Annabelle.After Mia gives birth to her doughter Lilly,Annabelel wants to kill her.Even the preist doesn's know how to help the unhappy familly.Everyone is terryfied and find out that a demon is attached by the doll.Idon't know the end of the story but i don;t think that is a happy one... It is sure that they have not experienced any English environment. They must be in troubles about English. The next reason is that some specific courses are not proper to use English. For example, lots of students always get hard time to take major lectures in English. It is because the course materials of major lectures are difficult and hard to understand. Student may not understand them well even in Korean. Professors have to explain the material in Korean additional, because students get hard to understand it in English. It happens frequently. he jump from his bed to the street and walk to his way to see what he did every morning.when he walk after the stranger man  he notice that he stopped in every trash in the street to take a look and go to the next one, and guess what he saw Michael and run away also Michael was afraid. as a result of this consumer gets more benefit like lower faire, privacy, freedom and safe travelling.in addition many automobile company launcing new car with affordable price which insiost people to use more and more private vechile. However, there are only a few foreign students, and it is not reasonable for all students to speak in English because of them. My town is very beautiful and I like it very much because it is not any dirty streets in it  The governor of my city seek to develop it and he said it will be the capital of delta actually after 30 years ago the people in my town deal with rubbish by healthy method , the citizens collecting the rubbish and threw it in big boxes far away the city. To sum up, I agree with speaking in Korean at KAIST lectures because of the lack of students' English skills and the courses which are not proper to use English."	3.5

Computers have caused a massive amount of obesity in the @LOCATION1 and that number is growing everday. One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance,  homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society.

I feel that xomputers are too harmful for society and should be stopped. Obesity is @CAPS4 of the biggest problems in the @LOCATION1 and is growing bigger everyday. my advice is be patient, be smart this sport not easy but it's need more trainee, more time to be one of the greatest player in the game Put yourself in the mind of a computerf addicy.

Not only is the fast-food bad for you, but you dont even give your body a chance to burn @CAPS7 those calories and carbohydrates that you just ate by exercising. Computer addicts do this almost everyday and before they know it, they are. @NUM1 pounds! In addition, people who thier hand-eye coordination can do it in every other ways than just going on a Computers contribute to a large portion of the obese population, but they also can be extremely time-consuming.

I have joined football-teams which is near to my home, I prefer to this team because of my family is not reach, they can not provide for my transportation fees to go exercises stadium. @CAPS1 look, I recieved a @CAPS2! Maintaing cars are expensive.Public transport you do not need to worry about any petrol filling, checking tyre pressures, getting tired after driving long journey.In future cutting down public transport affects many of the people.Elderly people wont able to drive always depends on public transport.If public transport stop services people who are not able to drive will  affect a lot. @CAPS4 thing thing another and @CAPS7 of a madden, @NUM2 or @NUM3 hours have already passed by.

"i love my family special my little sister, she has sixteen years old, i consider my best friend because i used to tell her everything of my life. This town is located in the central zone of the Afghanistan with 4462(km²) space, and has more than seven Million populations, the economic and security situation is not suitable and these factors have directly effect in to the carefulness of environment. One of the many ways is, they teach you hand eye coordination. It is very difficult to deny the importance of family in our life,  definitely families play an essential role community structure .According to the experts we can't create  successful society without creative families , and one another specific part of your life is a good partners surrounding your daily activities. With hand-eye coordination you @MONTH1 need it to play sports like baseball. When do you need hand-eye coordination the most? I use it most, when I'm playing hockey or, baseball. So next time your on a computer, remember your hand-eye coordination is improving. Another reason we benefit from having computers, is we learn about far away places. Yesterday ,I had a wonderful day  .In the morning I went to a Galician basketball training with a coach of Spanish selection ,when  finished went to my parents to a hotel to eat and stay with some friends , after the food meet with  friend´s of my parents and went to a theme park and we rode to a rollers coaster, it was very exciting and we ate a chocolate ice cream, it was delicious .At night we went to a match  of Spanish basketball league, Obradoiro versus Real Madrid and that match won the team of Real Madrid and then I went home to sleep. I know! get on a computer and do some research about it! An example of this is, @CAPS1 you have to fly out to @LOCATION1 and don't know anythin about it, use a laptop on the way over there. @CAPS1 you do that, you'll have some schema about the place. As you can see laptops and computers are great for learning of foreign countries. After waiting an hour the time comes and bravely  with high confident level he walke to the office. You need to learn spanish in a couple of weeks. What will you do? First,the bank notes are designed by consider,thinking from background colour,artwork,security issues.Then,the metal plates are preparated by skilled machinists.And then, the sheets are printed,operator should pay attention to the colour on both sides,special ink,and images slightly raised. @CAPS1 you don't know a lot of french and need a few words but don't have a dictionary. we bocome not only older but also wiser .we learn but the most useful thing to learn is to get in alot of experiences & for sure to make mistakes .but we have to be honest with our selves by admitting our mistakes to avoid them in the future . When you are talking to someone from @LOCATION1 and you don't know there language use an english to african dictionary translation app on your computer. Computers have a great translater applications that are free so, @CAPS1 you don't know a language hop on a computer and learn it! In conclusion, computers are used every day and help us greatly, weather it be learning a new language, or just talking to friends. Computer benefit society greatly."	3.5

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"But in some day tow guise with quad bike and they saw some thing wrong they sad what's that , they sow dead body , they skared and run to ther camp . So many people all over the world have computers. As I told you before because of the technology many things has become able in less time, and with the pass of the years this tend to increase. Please just listen to what I have to say. First, I beileve that computers help kids learn. If you buy computer games like a cooking game you can learn how to cook. Even if you buy the @PERSON1 you are still learning by taking care of them. There are so many good websites that you can go on like @ORGANIZATION1. People learn through playing new things and why not play with your favorite characters. Also, you can go on google and type in anything you want and it will give you the answer. You use a keyboard for all this so you also learn how to type. If your teacher gives you a homework assingment why not type it so you learn that skill. This is why computers are good for hearg kids learn. Secondly, you can communicate with others from around the word or just your friends. There is a thing called @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2. For some reasons, I really liked to play basketball, first, playing basketball can train my muscle and make the body more healthier ; the second, my classmates and I all know how to win a game through the basketball game because the basketball game is a teamwork. In the end,if it is a good sheet,the porcedure is packaging and distribution,including cutting into separate bank notes,packing,dispatching.If it is a bad sheet,the porcedure is disposal    --bad sheetsand bank notes should be securely destroyed. It is pretty cool because you don't have to travel there to talk to them. All of this stuff teaches you how people are different and no one person is the same. Peoples language could be different or there personality. So many communicating things make computers even better. Lastly, using computers helps teach responsibility. I am from spain so my foreign language is Spanish I start to study another language when I was a child, I started learning English because every one said that English is the future language, when I finished my school time I tried to study French but it was so difficult for me. If someone dosen't want to be bothered then don't bother them that has to do with privacy. Also, you learn to be nice on computers. If you video chatted you should definitely know to be nice and not be rude. my advice is be patient, be smart this sport not easy but it's need more trainee, more time to be one of the greatest player in the game Another thing is people learn to take care of things a computer is worth a lot of money. I start this sport since I was 10 years old.where my father was playing this sport also,but he started it when he was more greater than me,He was about 30 years old.where squash is one of the games that can be played in any age,I love this game because I find it making exercise to all the body in the same time , we are running in small place moving hands in stretched and different ways in the same time you are working your mind in the same time so it need caring and quik thinkink, as much exercise you will find down the road . Don't brag, but just know you are privleged for a computer. In addition, A general vision on the human innovation show that the majority of people creations have bad effect, this effect exist even in people's lives or themselves. So if you ever consider getting a computer the answer is yes because computers help kids learn, you can communicate with others, and you learn responsibility. Now you know computers are really good for kids not that bad."	3.5

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have recently heard about the debate on whether or not computers are used too often. Computers can be unhealthy, I think that generally they're helpful. They give us many oportunities that wouldn't exist without them. I'll describe more of what I mean in the following letter. Dear USA Summer camp I reply to your advertisement for work with children this summer in summer camps, have looked after children aged 5-10 and it was a fantastic experience, worked at school in north Africa like a volunteer and learnt a lot about children,  think that i'm a suitable person for the job because use to be an energetic and cheerful person and very hardworking, love working with children and  like organising several types of activities, I'm not very good cooking but i can learn very fast. Studying and school work. Computers can provide people with ways to research things. For students, it @MONTH1 be something like research for a project of essay. For adults it could be information on starting a business. In both of those cases, computers were used to get information in a simpler way then perhaps visiting a library, I, personally, know of a website called @LOCATION1, where teachers can set up online tests for students. This would not be possible without computers. Computer online courses can even taken, where a student can be taugh through the internet, rather than in person. This can be an advantage to someone that can't always get to classes. my father  my father name is Zaheer arat.he is very loving and caring.they gives us all the facilities one should have and dream of these things.he provides all the facilities to us of internet and books so that we can learn better and can be good students and get good marks in the examination.he always encouraged us and said don't afraid of anything because you are braver than anything else.my brothers and me proud of my father.he is very hard working and brave.he has the smiley face.he always tries to laugh other people with their jokes.he always listens to us what we want.he never ever ignore us. it can never be regained even the strongest monarchs have been helpless to prevent time.So should be careful about the importance of time .I hope to not waste it and use it as the best use for giving opportunity for rising .Those who waste it ,will be behind and they will fail to make a mark in their life.The great men and successful guys became fame and rose by a suitable use for time .They guide and source of inspiration for a new generation. These methods of communication have become extreamly popular recently, and I myself use both. I think for some people it can be bad because it prevents them from interacting with the real world. I'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant its name is ""Lemon"" I go there every week it has different food from any restaurants I'd like chicken crispy with garlic sauce It's Excellent choice for me and My favorite appitizer is susage and in order that desert I'd rather ""Vadge"" cake with chocolate sauce I feel I;m at ease when I go there I enjoy  classical music over having a lunch about the service It's very good and all staff are respectable I can't imagine one week without going there that drives me nuts I advise any one to go there and enjoy  a time there , also this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really It's  excellent This strikingly thing for anyone  despite all of these advantages prices are not expensive . It also gives parents and teachers another way to communicate. Someday he woke up early at the morning he go out for playing football before school, when he's playing he saw something running very fast and go away. Lastly, I'd just like to talk about how computers can benefit adults specifically. I know that many people pay their bills online. This is becaus if you think about it, isn't it a hassle to have to mail your bills every month? Computers greatly reduce that hassle. They can also make it easier to buy things you need, look for jobs, and many other things. Without computers, things like looking for jobs would require a lot more work than they do with them. These, again, are only some of the hundreds, if not thousands of ways which computers are helpful. In conclusion, I think I've made my point very clear. Any thing in moderation is okay. First, Basketball is team sport when it means i need to understand expression of  members  of team and keep contact them  for example  my roll is cutter but i need to do assister, blocker and guarding when i play. Generally this is not the case. Summer holiday, I have been to Italy on holiday 3 years ago.I didn't have a long holiday ,it was just for 3 days but these 3 days were the best in my life.I must say that I went there because my sister is living there so I didn't have to book a room at the hotel and spending too much money.I went to the Vatican and Rome,I saw their massive buildings which were impressive and their old houses.The weather was fantastic ,I love bathing in the sun and resting on the hot sand on the beach. They help very much with education, and even that alone I think should be enough to convince you that computers are helpful. But as I said, I hope I made my point clear, and I hope you agree with me."	3.5

According to the problems above mentioned,various approaches that governmentshould be adopted to deal with this problem.first of all,reducing building constructure from now on,planting more trees instead.Sustainadle development should be awaness to all human and start to porteat the environment and preserve the animals. If there is something on the shelf, someone can find something offensive in it. here is a good senario; there is a childrens book. It is one of the gratest books ever written, but it was written before the civil war and there is a racist comment in it. @CAPS1 good bye to that book. Some people would probably think '@CAPS1 its only a childrens book. I'm sure we will survive.' @CAPS1 lets move on to a bigger idea. What happens when someone says the bible is offensive. @CAPS1 thats gone, but now its supports are saying the other people's entire religion is offensive. Football is my favorite sports In my life.so,I pay more attention to it than any other things you might think of.I had been following series of football's events in and around the world at large.I took this time to command people who are sacrificing their entire life of the betterment of sportsmanship.With all that,I do have my favorite club team n country as well.And also have my favorite players,Ronaldinho,Messi and Eto'o.My favorite club is Barcelona and country is Cameroon although that I am from Liberia.I know football doesn't go by sentiments but the love of choice and what desire you the best.What really makes me to love Barcelona is that they play the football,instead of them running around.They always bring talented players that will make the club be more improved tactically.people always say this;""Barcelona doesn't buy players""it's not like,they are lacking money.We do essential purchasing of players to save more money.You have to save money for players to enable you to pay them on time.As normal humanbeings,you have to know how to spend money,where,when to spend it.it's not because you have more money then you lavish it.So,i love my team and my staff and how they run things in my team.The facts should not be hidden Barcelona is the best club team in the world,you like or not. Now we have violence. Moderate censorship is acceptable for the young, but there is a line, even though it is hard to find sometimes. Obsence images that are illegal to view by a minor are acceptable but those that are legal should be seen without censorship. Censorship for those who understand is unacceptable, although select items should be viewed under supervision. Hi, Jenny Well, as you asked me Jenny, the most brilliant actor than see before is Vin Deasel, it is an excellent professional and he protagonized a great deal of movies like the saga of Fast and Furious, Ridic , Nannies bulletproof and other extras films. The @LOCATION1 government has given people freedoms. One of those freedoms is the freedom of speech. This basically means i can say what ever i want and support whatever i want. A book is a form of speech. Although some speech is looked down upon, it should not be censored. Censorship is just basically saying; 'you can not say this.' With a great effort sate down on the grass, he feels tired, and has a little sensation of pain in his boson, site there with many sounds on air, he star recall...his face is changing is dark, he has now a clear image of all, when opened the door of the house his girlfriend is there dying on the floor, Michael remember all, the fight, the lays, the screams, the knife...the blood; but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Peter drove his car to the doctor's clinic and after half an hour he arrived and he and his grandmother go above through the stairs to reach the doctor's clinic after they arrived they found that they have to stay aperiod of time to take his turn they waited and then their turn came .they entered the doctor and the doctor was very kind he welcomed them and after check    peter's grandmother. In developing countries, such as congo, if you go to the goverment and say what they are doing wrong and that you are agianst them, take a guess at what happens. Finally, Taiwan still suffers economic slump, but we have so many businesses likes to innovate, market their product, customers likes to buy it. As i didn’t found nothing, i went to the place he live at and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he care about so as i continued to go to his houes i notice he will alays go to tehe same house so i decidec to follow him to the house and i foun out he was dating a girl she might be his girlfrien so i finally gota an idea, i would drive him crazy just as he did with me, that way she will think he had problems on his mind and left him, but son i thougt about it again and realized that if i did that she will try to help him and they will be more united,  so i decided to drive them both crazy almost at the border of death,  jus as he did with me! If you write a book saying how obama could be a better president, but someone finds it offensive, what happens. They censor you. Now you get no say in the matter because the supporters of obama dont want you to. Do you see much difference? Supervisation is a powerful thing. The creator of the haven and the earth, the creator of soles , the one who make earth rotate around it self and around the sun.What we belief as Muslims that, we have created by one who don't have other with him the one who create our father (Adam ) and created from him (Eve) and they were in the Paradise and instructed to not eat from the tree but the Satan deceive them so they brought to this life and generations came from them and had sent the prophet and messengers ( Moses, Jesus, Mohamed, others.. who they worship the same one) with Miracles and evidence of the truth, to guide the people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to the Paradise and who follow other paths which it will guide to the hell. With a supervison, children can still learn about topics but are not simply thrown into the obscene areas of it. A person is a human being. That includes children. In conclusion, we are assisting to a new tend in transport, every time, they are faster and more developer, with the latest technology included but at the oppossite case, we find also a contradiction, as we found an other trend for the tradictional transport which avoid the pollution in order to respect the Earth Censorship should not be used in libraries. It takes away freedoms and oppertunities for children. It causes violence among people. It scars culture, and ignores religion. This experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister (I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money. Censorship was created to protect people from things that they feel to be wrong. I think it would be important that, not only in the family, but also in the school could be grow a new generaion sensible to ecological problems of the earth."	3.5

Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Censorship in Libraries      I believe that there should be censorship in libraries. In @DATE1's society there are many kids who are hurting and are getting into bad things. There are somethings kids just should not see. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive. I would like to say for anyone wants playing soccer to be very careful when he plays it because it may cause a lot of injures ,but in the same time it is very nice game. Today, we have more item to recycle as long as we clean properly and put in a proper bin, which will be use it by specialized factory in another item. This has happened to me before. I once saw this kid that I looked up to drinking, and I almost took up drinking myself, but because I had the right peers, I didn't. The point is that when kids see someone they look up to doing a certain thing, it has a great impact. If that movie case is sensored then that kid would never even think about smoking because of his role model. Every parent is worried about their kid getting into trouble with the law, right? Some of the movies that a kid can get at a library has the actors doing illegal things in it. As Automotive Industries are huge in market, most of the  house holders  prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time . I have seen plenty of movies that made me want to go out and do what they did in the movie. What if that thing they see in a movie is murder? It maybe crazy to think that a kid would go out and murder someone because he saw people do it in a movie, but it could happen. The other chart is about employer support, under 26 years old is the most higterst because it almost have 70%, the scentd higterst is age 26-29 years old; it has 50% of people are taken; niy yhe most lower is 35% age of group are 30-39 years old. This kid was only six years old, but he thought that playing with guns was safe because he saw them do it in the movies. My town do much efforts to care of environment,they put many pins in the streets to keep it clean also they prevent private drivinig at many days to keep air clean ,they seed trees to absorb co2 and release o2 ,they build factories away from the house of population to prevent respiratory diseases which is a result of air pollution from factories,so not only my country it self but also the individuals follow a proper way to keep environment clean. Parents stress all the time about where their kids are, what they are doing, who they are with, and so on. Otherwise the public transport don't pollute but the car pollute so for us travelling by car is better than travellng by public transport but for the atmosphere is better travelling by  public transport than travelling by car This makes parents feel good and confident in their child's life. Finally, offensive movies are actually offensive, whether this be to the kid himself, the parents, or the audience that the movie is targeting. Keeping offensive movies censored can relieve a lot of hate in a kid's life. In public transport people bound to share transport means with strangers and also we have to persue company policy or regulations,but with their own transport we don't have to bother about these things we travel when we want and when we have time. In movies we always see the smart kids getting picked on and it seems like the athletes get all of the attention. my advice is be patient, be smart this sport not easy but it's need more trainee, more time to be one of the greatest player in the game In a recent time privet transport is more convenient than public transportation,although public transport  like buses, train ,ferries and intercity rail are consuming less time and energy but sometimes its create problems. This creates hate inside of their hearts, all because censorship was not used. In conclusion it has to be obvious that I feel censorship should be used in libraries. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive. With censorship, all of these things can be accomplished. This is not only helpful to the kids, but the parents as well. In my experience, censorship is a good thing to have."	3.5

"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 back a couple decades ago, before computers existed. What do you see? There were children outside exercising, playing with friends, and living somewhat danger-free lives then came the computer. Computers are driving the next generation to a dangerous life of staring at an assortment of pixers all day longels well as ruining any civilized relationships you had. I strangly believe that computers have a negative affect on society. Did you know that as tha number of computers sold increases the obesity rate has gone up @PERCENT1 since computers came into our lives why? Because people spend way too much time on and not enough time exercising! Computers another affect of the long hours spent in front of screen is a decrease in eyesight ability. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , that ha has planned two weeks ago  this episode was his sister's birthday ,"" Now it is the suitable moment to announce her about surprise "" peter said . in a car accident , when she her what happened with her brother she was so nervous then the miracle happened she found a big suitcase in the train she decided to open the bag because no one was in the train so she opened the bag she surprised when she saw  a lot of money inside the bag  . @CAPS2 @PERSON3, a concerned parent at @ORGANIZATION1. I decided and went.It was strange because I never went to the sports.From the time I started going to karate.After one month my instructor told me that I will go to the competition.I was very worrying and nervous. My name is Abrar saeed Al-mubarak.I'm 13 years old.I live in Saudi Arabia(Riyadh)  .And i'm in grade nine.I have 9 sisters with me we 10 .And 9 brothers.I really love to learn English lounge & French lounge spinach lounge  .And I speak Arabic . Predators surf the web, looking for young, innocent people to meet and most likely abuse @PERCENT2 of parents much been monitoring their children's computer usage parents are unaware that the internet makes it easy to talk to anybody in the world, from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2! Monitoring would also come in handy when it comes to innapropriate videos, pictures, and discussions on the internet. It is so easy to be surfing the web and fall upon things you should not be seeing! Lastly, people easily get caught up in being hidden behind a computer, and say mean, hurtful things that would never be said to one's face! these unfortunate factors cause many of the issues between people today. Speaking of which, computers have a very negative affect on relationships nowadays. As I mentioned earlier, so many fights happen through computer communications. we will know today some of information about Islam , Islam is great religion come from The Arabian Peninsula and its founded since 1436 years ago. After being in a computer-oriented friendship, people tend to forget how to act face to face and find personal meetings awkward. @PERSON1, an eighth grader at @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, ""I can't @CAPS5 only talking through computers, never being civilized with other human beings! This attitude reduced enromous amount of smoke pollution from the pipes.Government policy changes help a lot for water preservation.Many factories follwing the regulations and not draining the harmful wastage in the water. After waiting an hour the time comes and bravely  with high confident level he walke to the office. It could be a dangerous poser! This is yet another problem...through the internet, you @MONTH1 not even know who such relationships are with! It could be fake, and you'd have no idea. Spending all day rolling away in front of a computer, putting yourself and relationships in danger is, unfortunately, the effect of computers. Computers are not worth the terrible consequences civilization must face. Firstly, Django Unchained remembered us the hard life suffered by black people in the past, due to a great introduction without dialogues, where black people were unchained while they came back to be selling to an owner farm, it being matching with an amanzing soundtrack as identity Tarantino´s films. Make the change today."	3.5
453	Recommend a good place to spend the weekend with family/friends. Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"What are you planning to do this weekend? If you don't have any plans then how about to visit the plants park? There is a 'Hanbat plants park' nearby KAIST, so you can visit with family or friends. My town do much efforts to care of environment,they put many pins in the streets to keep it clean also they prevent private drivinig at many days to keep air clean ,they seed trees to absorb co2 and release o2 ,they build factories away from the house of population to prevent respiratory diseases which is a result of air pollution from factories,so not only my country it self but also the individuals follow a proper way to keep environment clean. However, I think Hanbat plants park is the best place to spend weekend with your family or friends for three reasons. I am person that like going to do exercise, for this reason I like practise some sports, but the truth is that my favorite sport all around the world is the soccer.I believe that play soccer is an excellent activity, because in every game that the people can like always has to exist some rules. In Hanbat plants park, there are introductions of plants around them. Therefore, if you are curious about the informations about some plants, you can read that introductions and learn new kinds of plants. For example, I learned about a plant that is named with its shape because I read that introduction. Firstly, staff and Personnel design the background colour , the artwork and the scuriity issues on the bank notes,which is also  done in process of other card,such as notes for supermarket.Then in the preparation process, skilled machinists prepare of metal plates for printing.After that sheets of bank notes are printed,there are differences and specials for it, it use special ink ,and print colors on both side,images are slightly rised. Recently, many people might get a lot of stress during life time. Since there are colorful plants and we can feel smell of plants, we can get rid of stress. In the reconquest age the stronghold never downfall with a direct assault, finally the Castellan's army after a large siege force to the government surrender it. But today, Things are getting change and technology marked a significant role in our life, Automobile segment increased its vertical and having a car becomes a need from luxory. Hanbat plants park does not have a fee to enter. In conclusion, for me it is a lie that the public transportation has no future, however, they have to make improvements to this like the use of better ways of fuel or energy, one way is using renovable sources of energy such as solar, haeolic (wind) or hidraulic(water),Also there are biodisel, and gasoline extracted from seaweed.And the public transportation will be more important in a few years than now. Besides, we can have fun by finding many facilities such as place to  see views, swings, and so on. When I visit there, it was fun to choose the path to walk because there are many facilities to look. All in all, you can have a walk by finding various facilities without worry about money. Finally, Hanbat plants park is the best place to make memories. Apart from that you see new places and you have fun, you also lern others cultures, historicals facts, you also lern to respect others peoples and thirs costums. You can make memories with your family or friends by taking photos with them. In addition, you can have a picnic in Hanbat plants park, so you can make good memories and take natural photos. To sum up, by taking photos and having picnic, you can remember this weekend at Hanbat plants park with family or friends for a long time. In conclusion, I recommend to visit Hanbat plants park because of chances to see various plants, walk around, and make memories. I hope my recommendation about this Hanbat plants park is helpful to you. After visiting here, you might change your thought that plants park is boring."	3.5
454	"Government: Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.    "	"Make More Investment in Roads and Highways

When people have a company or school which is located in a long distance, they use cars or public transportation to commute to and from school. I have learned to  get control of myself when someone teaes me , and to be alert as well .Also ,it helps to look always slim and put me away from the ghost of obesity as well .People who want to start playing karate have to be patient . Current transportation has many problems, so it is vital to invest in both on roads and highways or public transportation. When printing finished,they should inspection.It the most important step.Printed sheets manually inspected.Finally,they  found good quality sheets and some partially damaged sheeets or bad sheets.They will packaging and distribution the sheets which is good in there.In that time they at fist cut into separate bank notes ,second they packed the sheets and diapatched. First of all, people drive more cars than public transportation. If difficulties was told to the families, the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation. Besides, many people buy and use cars because they know that public transportation is quite uncomfortable. For example, public transportation has so few seats that it is inconvenient to ride standing up. In addition to more people drive cars, current situations on the roads and highways are awful. In a recent time privet transport is more convenient than public transportation,although public transport  like buses, train ,ferries and intercity rail are consuming less time and energy but sometimes its create problems. In other words, if these things happen on the way to and from work, there will be a catastrophe in which everyone is late. On the other hand, public transportation comes on time and goes along the set road, so there is no traffic accident, and there is much less risk of accidents. For example, in the case of subways, there is no risk of traffic jams, and buses also have designated bus lanes. Some argue that investing more in public transportation would be more economical because many people would use it. Only a few years ago this was true; however, considering the current public transportation system, there are so many people that it is very cramped inside. The more people using it, the longer time needed to wait for boarding on it. To sum up, it is desirable to invest more in roads and highways by the above grounds. More people are using cars rather than public transportations; furthermore, more improvements are needed for the roads and highways. After we came to the ambulance,police come and one patrol was catching those man who made that to that granny and the other patrol was talking to us.I found out that granny name is Rose and she had got operation after the accident. As people should move longer distance, investing in both cars and public transportation are right thing, but spending more in cars are needed for the current circumstances."	3.5

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"I think everybody admits that the balance between work and life is critical, but I'm not really sure if people know the importance of balance inside the work. Nowadays, the transportation become more prefect,and the people'life become more convenient.Althought this change lend the life of people efficient,the problem should not be ignored.It would really be helpful if the government make tighter resrictions,in today's world ,lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission, they are destroyed the forest,farmland and wetland,charging waster water and emitting greenhouse gas,it lead to a serious enviorment problem.So the government should oversee this companies ,and if companies do not obey the rules or laws ,it will be fined and closed. Its very simple and wonderful sport.If you play cricket you are surely going to burn many bad calories adhered inside your body.In India cricket is worshipped and players are the lord.The best part of this game is you can play with every age group at a single time.I was very interested in making my career through this but due to my studies I can't take effort toward this. Several years ago, our country announced a new education philosophy called STEAM. I can't recall what it's short for exactly, but I can remember that the education will teach students not only on few chosen subjects, but covering up all boundaries including, science, math, art, P.E., literature and etc. After we came to the ambulance,police come and one patrol was catching those man who made that to that granny and the other patrol was talking to us.I found out that granny name is Rose and she had got operation after the accident. If a student specializes on one subject, the student will probably become an expert in that category. He/She'll be better on tasks which only includes the subject the student specialized on. However, in most of the cases, that is not what tasks are made up of. For example, in order to understand how humans digest food and turn into particles that our cells can use, which is within the boundaries of biology, it is necessary to know the process of how molecules react with others. We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben, which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye.To got to the Big Ben we took the underground, but to get to the London Eye a red bus.After 3 days we went home.I forgot to tell you something about homeless people.A lot of people are homeless, which is sad, but maybe we can change it. In order to master on one subject, it is essential to study other subjects. By studying many subjects there are more benefits than the extra knowledge. Our brains can refresh while moving on to an  another subject. The television is one of the most important AV media in the world.You can use it for many purposes, according  to your needs .There are a lot of channels in many roles,for instance , education , movies, songs ,sports,news and so on .The television is not only for entertainment but also for education .The television can entertain you through it's entertained channels, and the television can educate you through it's educational channels. Last week when I took the first class of physics at KAIST, the professor told us that physics are lying beneath every science subject and that is why it is important to learn it. Which I partly agree. Quantum physics is a part of physics, but doesn't follow the common rules of physics. Looking in a mathematical or computing view, it is much easier to understand and break down the problems. This is proof that we need more than just one perspective. As the world is evolving and the science, technology is evolving together, people need to learn the ability to gather up information from many different subjects. That is why students need to take classes in many subjects, not focusing on just one.."	3.5

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern: I will agree that computers have caused many people to spend less time outside. However, it has kept kids inside instead @ORGANIZATION2 on the streets causing trouble. Computers have become a part @ORGANIZATION2 our everyday life. Some use it to stay connected with family or to reconnect with old friends. Experts say it's bad but the @ORGANIZATION2 gives us a computer class in @ORGANIZATION1? We learn keyboarding skills. @ORGANIZATION3 techniques and how to research any topic. In conclusion, we are assisting to a new tend in transport, every time, they are faster and more developer, with the latest technology included but at the oppossite case, we find also a contradiction, as we found an other trend for the tradictional transport which avoid the pollution in order to respect the Earth If we could travel back in time, we would most likely see kids hanging around the streets. Now-a-days, kids spend a lot @ORGANIZATION2 time inside, on the computers. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I bet you, or your parents, or maybe even your grandparents used to hear @ORGANIZATION2 gangs or fights going on in the streets. Now that computers have become an important item in many people's lives you don't hear those types @ORGANIZATION2 things as much. I'm not saying they don't happen but you don't hear your child come home and talk about gangs and fights. She turned her haid and saw him ""he was fowling me"" she thought""well,I should ask him what are he doing here"" ""What are you doing here"" ask Alison he looks her but with a bad smile,and turn his head In history you probably learned about immigrants coming over to @LOCATION1 to get away from their ruler. In conclusion, for me it is a lie that the public transportation has no future, however, they have to make improvements to this like the use of better ways of fuel or energy, one way is using renovable sources of energy such as solar, haeolic (wind) or hidraulic(water),Also there are biodisel, and gasoline extracted from seaweed.And the public transportation will be more important in a few years than now. Maintaing cars are expensive.Public transport you do not need to worry about any petrol filling, checking tyre pressures, getting tired after driving long journey.In future cutting down public transport affects many of the people.Elderly people wont able to drive always depends on public transport.If public transport stop services people who are not able to drive will  affect a lot. he said kindly:""I buy you a present,open it,Tom"" Tom opened the big bag,Oh!This is a big surprise,there was a football in it,which he always wanted to buy there were some words goal!keep doing! Second advantage is Internet by website, such as twiter, facebook... You allow speak with your quick friend, or you can meet ith them by website, therefore you do not call by telephone, so internet is too much cheap. Travelling by car is much more convenient but all know really there is no future for public transport.When we talk about public transport,there are many people and everyone travel but i think we do not feel relax are there and if we talk about travelling by car.It is the best or much more convenient for us.Because we can travel any where but in public transport we can not travel to any other sites To stay in touch they email or @CAPS1 chat. The five hour time difference makes it difficult to know when to call. The invention @ORGANIZATION2 computers has made it easier to catch up with family! Most importantly, the use @ORGANIZATION2 computers is influenced in schools. Apart from that you see new places and you have fun, you also lern others cultures, historicals facts, you also lern to respect others peoples and thirs costums. We are also taught how to correctly cite and research work. This is helpful because if we don't know this information we could plagiarize and plagiarism is illegal. Frequently, teachers give us projects that ask for computer use.. Either we have to look something up for specific, accurate information or we have to type a @ORGANIZATION3 document. As well as using the the online @CAPS2 book instead @ORGANIZATION2 taking it home. I have played this sport for twelve years ago this sport has taught me to respect the other not assault to him.there is the only reason that makes me choose this sport is I don't want to be weak I wouldn't like to be nothing in this country that has a rule Strong dominated the weak.when I put my feet in the gym i forget everything shcool,home...therefore I enjoy it.I can't imagine my life without taekwondo it is my blood,my soul.taekwondo it is not a violent sport as many people say but what you have to know is what in the brain and the heart of players.I just get the 1st degree international black belt and I would like to tell to anyone he just starting this sport use your abilities and skills for the right things. Students stay off the streets and only cause trouble with siblings at home. This helicopter had humid then the helicopter star to rotate in all the island then the helicopter go sinking in the water then the hurricane finished  the engineers start to distribute the food and medicine.

"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 do you feel about computers? I know that I think they are a great to we are lucky to have them. Firstly as everybody know the cost of the fuel is increasing more and more,  adding to those the bill that own a car will bring, it became immediately clear that it is cheaper go around by public transport. I hope you will share my opinions in your next article to help pursude readers on my view of computers. What I believe is the best thing about computers, is that it is a great source to learn. The internet can connect all over the world, and you can learn about other cultures. You can know everything about that country without ever visiting! Or you can use it to find out about you family's history. Many record keeping systems are switching to computers now. When we took a field trip to @LOCATION1 they had data bases there that had every name of the people that went through there. First of all,tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world.Alongside with its development,the ablity of travalling has easened to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another.The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism,as well as with the idea of globalisation,since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen. Another thing about computers is they help you in the work place. Lets say you had a job designing houses to be built. Michael is a good boy and he always listen to his mother .on time Michael was very angry as he got a bad score in his test .when he was home his mother was cooking she asked him what is the wrong ? They told her that her brother had a car accident first of all she shocked  Then she went quickly to the train station and she bought ticket to London when she was in the train she had other phone cell . In conclusion, for me it is a lie that the public transportation has no future, however, they have to make improvements to this like the use of better ways of fuel or energy, one way is using renovable sources of energy such as solar, haeolic (wind) or hidraulic(water),Also there are biodisel, and gasoline extracted from seaweed.And the public transportation will be more important in a few years than now. He selected people to into in a chinese room, there was a computer in chinese language with diferente symbols, the american was a diferente behavior, they did not understand what was in the computer screen. Computers also play in a social role. On the internet you can connect and chat with friends. Also you could share pictures of both of you at a baseball game @DATE1 to keep memories. Or you can send them a website with a really funny video of someone getting with a soccerball. Most of the organizations known how is affect managemant acountant practice on them work , therefore they are chossing good programme and employee. ""@CAPS2 @PERSON1 (computer expert and developer) what do you think the number one reaso teen use computers teen use computers is?"" @CAPS3, I would have to say to chat with friends. The village I live, there is a lot of vegetation for that reason we try to protect environment, some of the things we do is to give mantainance every week to the vagetation zone checking if there is any garbage, to avoid this we teach the younger´s enviromentalist actions so they don´t throw cans,paper,or,candies to the floor they also can help the older people, there are cases which a person throws garbage to the street´s,floor or to the vegetation to avoid that happening again we have a punishment that is to pay some money if the don´t they wont be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again, unless they were visitors, in that case we told him or her the way we live in the village and, we give him or her advises to keep a beautiful place without garbage. Computers are, a great advancement in our technology. They assist us in everyday life, life and make difficult tasks simple. They should not be over used though and you need to keep a healthy mind and body. All of the thing we could learn from them though help in the argument of that. To me the computer is the same step forward as the light bulb was. Computer source found @PERCENT3 of in @LOCATION2, and. Secondly, studying in university, I have to live far from house which make me be homesick, sad, and worried I have to live in dormitory with many strange friends, they ‘re very noisy and I have to share my room with my roommates. Some families find them @CAPS2 useful the have more than one in the household. They can come in all shapes and sized to fit your wants and needs, and can connect you to anything in the world."	3.5

Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Let me explain my reasons, when you drive your car you can take it from your garage or in the main door of your house and it gets you whatever you want, but on the other hand if you take public transport it will be much more uncomfortable because you must catch the bus in the bus stop... where is your nearest bus stop? Whether it be a time of war or a religious restriction, it is always viewed as a negative thing and therefore should be no different today. For other hand, People make other inventions for improving the world and reduce pollution, for example, In this time we have created electric cars or organic food, these things are very useful in future, because we will need to reduce pollution. It is a right to be able to obtain the information theses materials offer. No material should ever be removed from a public library based on censorship. Some @MONTH1 argue that certain material @MONTH1 be offensive to other groups of people, but who is it to judge how another feels. Material is written or made to show the feelings of the author and how they want thier feelings or knowledge portrayed. Thirdly,Public toilets has been opened for the public to elminate attitude of urinating in the public places.Town council not only encourage people to planting or garndening,it subsidise money for their green improvements.Example,free fertilizers,water pump failitiesand pesticides. It is at the responsibility of the public to how they use the information they receive. It is still a piece of history and was recorded for a reason. Religion is always a hot point when it comes to censorship, but is that not in our constitution. Freedom of religion includes how we interpret and study our religions. Most have holy books and writings. Many express their religion by means of music and culture. It is a right for the public to be able to access this material. There are some rare situations when restrictions @MONTH1 need to be upheld but merely based on age. This however doesn't restrict the public, but offers parents the right to censor what information their children are able to get ahold of. An age limit on specific types of material could be added in the cases of sexual content, vulgar images, or distrubing content unsuitable for children. Secondly,Closed trash bins provided to the people in order to collect the waste and recycling.People come forward and utilising this bin effectively instead of throwing away.As a result of this town looks clean compare to previous decades. It is never right to tell people what they can or can not know. It is a part of the very structure of our country to allow all information to be shared freely. There are many accidentally problems encountered by international students studying in Australia.It is believed that the most important one of the problem is culture barrier.Because of different culture backgrounds,the talking  style of internaional students who come from different countries are various. One they animals went with Ana and give her an incentive for being an athlete or make something else than stay sleeping. Whatever it @MONTH1 be called, book banning or censorship, it is a negative thing and should not be a part of our public library systems."	3.5

"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1 @MONTH1 say that people are spending too much time foucusing on the computer and not on their homework, or getting some fresh air outside. I say those people are @CAPS1! so, on my opinion, even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers the most family member I love and think she is the best friend of mine , my sister , she is elder me about 12 years , I can tell her any thing about my life , my self , my feelings ,hhh also i think if i felt in love she would be the first to know that . I know that I am a suitable person for this job, and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job, because I have been travelled for all the world and in this experience, I have seen in the necesity on work to fiance my journey, so the I have dedicated to work on summer camps, and I have a lot of experience in this. You race back to the library only to find out that it is closed. In a recent time privet transport is more convenient than public transportation,although public transport  like buses, train ,ferries and intercity rail are consuming less time and energy but sometimes its create problems. Even though do not everyone doing that,so how much public office is care of environment is important and this town is care of that a lot.Every morning some peasons are coming park and cleaned that makes feel really thanksgratitude. Also, possibly you are having trouble with math homework and you are home alone, what do you do then? That is what computers are there for! So you can easily go to your teachers website and there would be the explanation on how to do that specific lesson. Children @CAPS2 to commonicate with their friends, to some extent. Such as a homework question or just to talk for fun. Without friends children would be knowhere. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of all children who are permitted to talk with friends, out of school stay off of drugs and promote a stronger education and grades. The internet was not just created for the heck of it. It was invented so people can communicate, childeren can do reaserch, and for fun and exploring as well. For example - learning about far away places, people, and culture, exploring animals, and even online shopping is now availble. These are necessities for all people to have access to. Without computers @CAPS3 would not know the important news when @CAPS3 needed to or information needed for a specific moment. Computers are the future (yes I am repertative) @CAPS3 @CAPS2 to have computers in our lives for communication, shopping, learning purposes, teaching, research on places, animals, people, and culture. Also for email purposes and to get important news around to everyone applicable to it. This is why @CAPS3 @CAPS2 to continue forward with computers, and technology for the future. In all over the world people always need advices to keep looking after their environments .First ,the municipal should do workshops in schools and universities providing students by tips that should help us to make our environment clean .Second ,they should make awareness campaigns about environment ;for example , telling people to put their rubbish in waste papre basket which helping workers to recycling it easily .Finally ,to stay healthy we need a healthy environment .

Just like Katherine Paterson had said, if people did away with everything that offended them, there would not be any books left for any of us. Everyone has the choice whether they either want to read the book, or they do not. If they do not want to, then they do not have to. If you are living in big town or small It does matter but one thing should be taking care by the people and organiser of the town, is environment.Global warming  is huge issue in today's date. I used all of the things except two.I didn't have the Internet when I was child.And also we couldn't choose  programmes.I played in the street and walked to school alone.I'm thinking what kind if things were more dangerous for me?It was so dangerous when my friends and I swam in the Tobol river.We jumped into the water and caught crayfish.When I remember that moment I am exciting.I guess everychild want to investigate the world.We have to help them,to show and explain.What kind of risks they can get if to do that. I find a lot of people to say things that offend me, but that does not mean that I have the right to make them stop talking. I just finish my lunch time, and before prepare everything to go to work I was thinking of you and I wanted to give you a small surprise with this fantastic photos, I hope you like it. it's for this reason that I think the public transport is a great benefit for the society, and a good way for move us of the one place at other,  I suggest that  the government  has to give more means for the purpose of improving the public transport. But, I do not think that just because they are graphic that they should be taken off the shelves. But lot of peoples saying that, the zoo can protected endagered spices against illegal poachers. In this book, a young girl is raped very harshly. But, the author did not write the book to tell everyone about her experience. She wrote the book to explain that no matter what happens, there is always something that can help. This book was a success story, and the graphic detail is there to show the agony the girl had went through. Some might find this offensive, but most think that it is uplifting to know that they are not the only ones who have had it happen to them. Books are not the only things that might offend some people. In certain department stores, there @MONTH1 be a movie that has a line in it that I take offensively. Does that give me the right to take it off of the shelf and demand that it be banned? No, and why might that be? Because I have a choice if I want to watch it or not. Another place is the @CAPS2. If you ask me, there are a lot more offensive things on the @CAPS2 then there are in books. Kids can get on the @CAPS2 and stumble across things that they definitely should not see, so does that mean we should ban the @CAPS2? But she is boyfriend live upstate and hasn’t got a airport he’s of city because of that she was need choose by train. If I wanted to, I could find offense in everything that is in a library. Books based on religion, or maybe a website based on a musician that had references to drugs in their lyrics. I would be mad if I came to the library to listen to music and someone had removed them from the computer. Today personal vehicle become pride of the life , mean if a person is on there personal vehicle they are look as higher status in the society . So, my opinion is that books, or anything else for that matter, should not be banned because someone didn't like what it contained. Not everyone is going to like the same book, and that's why there is such a variety to choose from. When I want studying for exams  going to the living room and sitting front of TV In addition, there is a small blackboard for my littel brother because my mother wants my prother learn Arabic and English letters. After all, we are not forced to do anything. This process involves five main stages.First,it should take some considerations in design,including background colour,artwork,security issues.Next,skilled machinists is prepared ,in which there are metal plates.Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet).Subsequently, the technical must be used specially for distinction,for example the colour printed on both sides,Special ink is used and imges slightly raised.After this,printed sheets will be inspected carefully.According to the quality of sheets,it will be two results.if the quality is good or the bank notes is partially damaged which can be used,it would cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and disoatched.while those bad sheets will be securely destroyed."	3.5

If anything they should just put a label on the cover of the book that says somthing along the lines of 'adult content.' This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. What about the @CAPS2, when @NUM1 million @CAPS7 were killed because they were @CAPS7. @CAPS7 @MONTH1 find these books offensive but that doesn't mean the @CAPS2 never happened. There are many offensive and contraversial pictures and stories about events that happened during the @CAPS2. Even though this is a very depressing and horrific subject, it is still good for our @CAPS20 to learn about what happened. And other catagories need to be read because it can help @CAPS20 to understand right from wrong, and help prevent them from making big mistakes in the future. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 started from the @DATE1's all the way until @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @NUM2. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 took a toll on everyone in the @LOCATION1A, but some people couldn't handle it as well as others. In the south, most @CAPS19 treated @CAPS17 @CAPS18 as dirt. They didn't let them in their schools, in their clubs or churches, they were rude towards them, and most horrific of all, they lynched them. There were a set of @PERSON1 called the '@PERSON1,' which pretty much was a list of @PERSON1 to treat @CAPS25 as unfairly as possible. as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! my favorite sport is swimming i swim 2 times per a week sometimes i go to the swimming pool in the same area which i work there and sometimes i go to the swimming pool of my cousin, i enjoy when i spend my time in the water and now even i am pregnant i am afraid when i swim with a group of people i keep telling them and screaming do not close with me ! Parents need to sit down with their @CAPS20 when they have questions and discuss the truth with them. What are parents going to do when their @CAPS20 go to school and hear other @CAPS20 talk about subjects such as sex? @CAPS20 could get the wrong idea about sex or not know exactly what it is because their parents never actually sat down and explained to them what sex is. I am not saying to go let your @NUM3 year old look at pictures of people having sex by any means, but when @CAPS20 get to a certain age, their parents need to step up and talk to them about uncomfortable subjects such as puberty, sex, and babies. It is time parents stop hiding the truth from their @CAPS20, or hovering over their shoulders like helecoptors. People can travel through the city easily and safely.For instance Melbourn,the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area.Therefore people don't need to drive cars for travelling in the city.The last point is people go for long journey by public transport.Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately.He had to buy a present for his girlfriend´s birthday but it was Sunday and all stores were closed so he had to found a solution.A few hours,he was walking by a garden,and suddenly,he saw the most beautiful flowers that he has ever seen,so he picked them up.However,flowers weren´t enough so he decided to think in anything else.Several hours later,he found an open sweet shop and he bought some bonbons for her.Finally,he had found the present and before the end of the day he ran quickly to his girlfriend's house.If you don't want to pass this situation,you must always do things with time. Just because these books are different than others we will just get rid of them, just like how we tried to kill off all the @CAPS7 and @CAPS25 because they were different. Travelling by car is convenient but there are dis advantage as well.As our population growing fast in a family both husband and wife working and children at university able to drive, so you are looking per house least 3 cars, so imagine how busy our roads will be.As now fuel price coming down that does not mean that it will stay like that for ever, price go up and down."	3.5
462	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"sukh was so angry with him because he heart her a lot, sukh refuse to give her laptop and her brother start again fighting with her and even he slapped her sister. As far as I'm concerned, part-time job plays an increasing important role in college life and I'm for the idea. Nevertheless, several people argue that it is a waste of time to take a part-time job and obviously, college students ought to put more emphasis on their study. In addition, part-time job not only takes up much of their free time but also means little to them. On the contrary, others think that it is acceptable, reasonable, and beneficial to take a part-time job. The reasons are as follows. First of all, it is undeniable that college students can accumulate certain experience through part-time jobs. Pass some years  of the university and he know a girl called Kate and he get loved on here and she get loved in him. What's more, admittedly, if you do some more work at your free time, you will find life is not so dull and you can do something meaningful to enjoy your college life. In a word, from my perspective, part-time job, to some extent, is indispensable to our college life. Regardless of other people's ideas, I support my own opinion and I think it is essential for college students to take part-time job."	3.5

"Dear @CAPS1: Some people believe computers benefit society. However, others feel they are too consuming. I for me I belive computers help society. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, give people, and even allows computer to chat online with other people. I'd bet your job requires you to use a computer, you probably even have a personal computer which you like to use to chat with friends. I do that all the time and I like it. Another thing I like are sports. One of my favorite sports is softball. In softball you need to have hand-eye cordination, this will help you swing at the ball more accuratly. When a pitcher throws the ball you have to had the bat at the right angle and watch the ball to know when to swing if kids used computers and become good at hand-eye cordination, then possibly more kids would join a local sports team, and possibly even join travel team. We're looking for a new nice home and so we are truly interested to keep your place tide and take care about it as it were our own. I do, and are why I learn about places before I go is by looking that particular place up on the internet. About three years ago I went on vacation to @LOCATION1. I wanted to know what it was like there because I had never gone before, so when I looked it up I found out that they had many torist attractions and ""packages"" that let you swim with dolphins, I was very excited to go and when I did, I had a biast, and to think if I didn't look it up I would not have known what kinds of fun things they had! Travelling by using any transport has become in one of our needs, in the past people used to take hours waiting for the public transport, now, we can afford any of those modern car at the agency. One of the biggest reasons why I like computers is because I can chat with my friends online one main attraction online is @CAPS2, everybody, primarily, has one. Some people have one because they like to look at pictures. I have one because I like to chat with my friends. Tennis, tennis is not jsut a sport anyone can play but it's professional sport needs to more hard trainee and more time to be perfect in it, in first why I choose tennis?, seriously in 2003 this is my first time to watch the game on TV when I saw roger federer played I think he is the one that made me love this sport, due to it's professional motion in playing the ball, from this time I was interested in this game and watching all championship, so more time, time and time it was my favoirite sport. I thanked her and then completed my work. Personally I believe that those who are not participate any activity the teachers has them to encourage .Then only they also know how talented they are.Every student should attend and show their talent.After some ages we can not attend any this type of activity because we all are become old .So let do and enjoy your young age be happier. Michael went into the teacher office,but he found that his teacher isn't here,maybe teacher went to the bathroom,suddenly,the door is opened by teacher,a teacher who wore bikini came into sight,this incident came as quite a surprise to Michael,she flirted with Michael,Michael felt excited but run out of the office,but he had regret for his action,Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. So you now see why society needs computers and if you have forgotten let me remind you: computers teach you hand-eye cordiantion, let's you learn about faraway places and people, and now allows you to chat online. I am person that like going to do exercise, for this reason I like practise some sports, but the truth is that my favorite sport all around the world is the soccer.I believe that play soccer is an excellent activity, because in every game that the people can like always has to exist some rules."	3.5
464	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"It goes without saying that smoking do has bad influences on our bodies. If we keep smoking for a long period, we may be addicted to it as a result of the substance in the smoke named nicotine. It is possible that we are too addicted to quit smoking as we realize that smoking is such a terrible thing, unless we have the great determination and willpower to overcome all the difficulties we may meet during the time of quitting smoking. There is not so much traffic, and my senses and lounges perceive and respire all the smell that flowers,  land, the First, I walk slowly and then I begin to walk as soon as possible to improve my fitness and I end walking 5 turns in the park. Provided that we suffer from lung cancer, it will make not only ourselves uncomfortable but our family unhappy and worried about us as well, and the worst one is that we may even die because of it. Moreover, when smoking, we produce a kind of material which is so-called ""second-hand smoke"". My town do much efforts to care of environment,they put many pins in the streets to keep it clean also they prevent private drivinig at many days to keep air clean ,they seed trees to absorb co2 and release o2 ,they build factories away from the house of population to prevent respiratory diseases which is a result of air pollution from factories,so not only my country it self but also the individuals follow a proper way to keep environment clean. one day Michael decided to make a surprise party to sinha to make her happy and feel his love more so he arranged everything and to keep it surprise to her he was busy all the time and did not show off all the week as usual .that make sinha worried and suspect that Michael do not love her any more and know another girl and she become extremely sad and even it become worse when Michael asked her to go to his apartment to make  the surprise to her  but he did not answer his phone after that . To sum up, cigarette smoking is really bad for our health. As a consequence, we should never smoke no matter what kind of conditions we are in. In addition, we are supposed to persuade our family accustomed to smoking to stop doing it."	3.5

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear editor, Computers are becoming more and more prevalent in the @LOCATION1. Second advantage is Internet by website, such as twiter, facebook... You allow speak with your quick friend, or you can meet ith them by website, therefore you do not call by telephone, so internet is too much cheap. Because of computers, people have lacked exercise, missed enjoying nature and other parts of the world and forgotten about interacting with family and friends. Computers should be used in moderation and not in place of other important events in our lives. First of all, computer users receive significantly less exercise than those who do not use computers. According to a survey done by the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 only @PERCENT1 of computer users reported that they exercised at least once every week. In contrast, @PERCENT2 of non-computer users (non-frequent computer users) reported that they exrcised at least once every week. Can one imagine what it would be like if everyone was a loyal computer user? Nearly everybody would be overweight, lethaigic from lack of sleep due to hours on the computer, and unworldly. Getting exercise is an essential part of everyone's life, and lacking it could be deleterious to one's health. The One of the most amazing thing that attractive you, is that it has  safari  which is more enjoyable thing ,at the sometime,it is introducing you to a wildlife  without needs to go out from your city. However,the family is near you since the day you were born until forever.The members follow you,and can based on them.You can tell whatever you want to them.For example,if you are in a bad mood the first person that will come next to you,to make you smile is your mom or dad.Mom and dad spent their life to grow up their children,to feed them,to love them! By traveling to @CAPS1 and unfamiliar places in the world, one is able to experience and learn about other cultures. Going on the internet @MONTH1 be a decent way to learn about other places, but actually feeling the ambiance and environment of a foreign place is allows for a much more profound understanding of another place. For example. I'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant its name is ""Lemon"" I go there every week it has different food from any restaurants I'd like chicken crispy with garlic sauce It's Excellent choice for me and My favorite appitizer is susage and in order that desert I'd rather ""Vadge"" cake with chocolate sauce I feel I;m at ease when I go there I enjoy  classical music over having a lunch about the service It's very good and all staff are respectable I can't imagine one week without going there that drives me nuts I advise any one to go there and enjoy  a time there , also this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really It's  excellent This strikingly thing for anyone  despite all of these advantages prices are not expensive . I saw the separation between the poor and the rich when I lookes from humble sharks along the river to the portentous, eregant edifices scraping the sky. It was an experince I could not encounter on a computer. People should be able to enjoy the wonders and differences of the world not on a small screen of a computer, but through the screen of one's eyes. If you want we could go to the capital city of my country, we will go by the car because the car is cheaper than the bus or train, we could eat in the famous restaurant of the city or we could go to the cinema also if you want I could visit the medieval wall. From my personal experiences, I tend to ignore friends and family. I agree that communiting by car is easier and faster than most of the public transportation; however, there are serious problems come after it; the amount of vehicles on the roads keep increase and make congestion and pollution which are far more severe than the inconvenience causing by public transportation. Without this basic necessity people cannot be happy. In summary, computers should not be used in excess. This sort of use could read to people getting less exercise, not fully experiencing the world, and closs of interaction with friends and family. To make a better country and nation, the people of the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 should make an effort to reduce computer use."	3.5

"Newspaper and Readers, Computers are a very large part of our lives and society. However, there are still people who think that computers do harm. Actually there are many positive effects that computers have on people. Among those effects are ease of communication, ease of gathering information, and ease of find entertainment. Computers have far more positive than negative effects. Computers have made communication easy for people. There are so many different means of communication using the computer, which are all free. For example, instant messaging, @CAPS1-mail video chat, chat rooms, @CAPS2 (and other social networking sites), are all there and help you communicate with friends and family. when i ran with the ball, i feel that i hold a goal or a valuable something and i should offer my best to put it in his place and make it in right way  . Being social is heathy for people and therefore communication is a positive effect of computers. Dear Sir or Madam Reference to your advertisement I would like to apply for the position to work in AMERICAN SUMMER CAMPS,I am John from  the capital city of south state in India, I worked in middle aged  school for about 2 years, where I had experience which will be suitable for the current position. For example, if a kid needed to know about the climate of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4.S for his social studies project, instead of having to get in his moms, drive all the way to the town library, spent time looking for the book, he could just log on to @ORGANIZATION1 and go from there. This is a positive effect on him because it saves him some time and effort. And the strengths and weaknesses in both of segmental and suprasegmental, I think it’s maybe the learning habit, when I heard a sentences, I would use many varieties of tone and manner to say the sentences again, therefore,I can easily be interpreted illustrations instructions the emotions and feelings. All at these things make having a computer a very positive thing in somebodys life. Computers are a great source of entertainment. In this economy, I know we all could benefit from not having to pay rental fees for movies and big prices for your exams or playstation games. it's for this reason that I think the public transport is a great benefit for the society, and a good way for move us of the one place at other,  I suggest that  the government  has to give more means for the purpose of improving the public transport. In addition to that, there are websites who offer free movies and television shows to be streamed right to your computer. For another,there are many different types of programs,which can broaden our eyes,they give details of education,plus other meaningful information，such as documentaries，talk show and so on.These programs are not just for killing the time,but for educating. Good Morning: This is an esay about my favourite sport,it is swimming since I was a child because always enjoy a lot and what is more I can do it alone, I never refuse to go swimming pool and less in summer, of course. I hope now that readers of this newspaper will now understand how good computers are next time you are for king for a late fee on a libary book or movie, remember that the internet and your computer have offered an alternative."	3.5

"Dear people, Computers have been here for not a very long time and everyday more people buy computers and everyday people use them. As they are used for entertainment, education, and talking with people faraway, they have had a negative effect on people. Let me explain. Everyone eagerly waiting for the ambulance arrival but still not yet reached the reason is our college location is little far from the city that's why it is getting late. One of the example is television, in the past we use it only for watching news and movie, but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t, now television has others function. But as they keep using it, they start to get addicted. looking at the information in more detail.Initially,bank note should be considered the design such as background colour ,artwork,and security issues.then,the preparation of metal plates is next stage.bank note should be skilled and machinists.thereafter,this stage is printing .worker should pay attention to colour on both sides,special ink , and images slightly raised. In fact, @PERCENT1 of all the people in this @CAPS3 who owns a @CAPS8, is addicted to computers. That percentage is expected to grow to @PERCENT2 in the next @NUM1 years. Addiction to computers lead to serious issues. A few minutes ago,some boy who looks  like elderly than my old brother closed to the poor little boy,the little boy stopped cried,he looked on some boy,my brother felt afraid because they look like rube,but he still  wanted help the little boy. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , that ha has planned two weeks ago  this episode was his sister's birthday ,"" Now it is the suitable moment to announce her about surprise "" peter said . His parent found out that he was addicted to this game ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4."" This game is right now the most played game on the @CAPS8 in this @CAPS3. Studies state that @CAPS8 addiction is almost as bad as smoking addiction. As i didn’t found nothing, i went to the place he live at and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he care about so as i continued to go to his houes i notice he will alays go to tehe same house so i decidec to follow him to the house and i foun out he was dating a girl she might be his girlfrien so i finally gota an idea, i would drive him crazy just as he did with me, that way she will think he had problems on his mind and left him, but son i thougt about it again and realized that if i did that she will try to help him and they will be more united,  so i decided to drive them both crazy almost at the border of death,  jus as he did with me! People chat on @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and email and people are bullied. A friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feeling. Online bullying is worse that inteacting bullying. That's because @CAPS9 you say something on the @CAPS8, people don't know who you are. @PERSON1, a proffesor who recently did studies of online bullying says, ""Online bullying has become more severe than contact to contact bullying. At first and important change is about eating prepared food that isn't healthy usually,its reason probably woman's life stile that is going to big change in the way that they don't like staying at home and spend their time to making food ,now they prefer to buy prepared good. The online bullying and harassment is going to get worse @CAPS9 people don't stop. Also people can get arrested for what they write online. My final reason why computers have a negative effect on people is that people spend too much time on computers and don't exercise @CAPS8 contribute about @PERCENT3 to overweight people. On the @CAPS8, everything is much easier. Instead of mailing, you could e-mail. The diabetes is the increasing  of the glucosa in the blood, The have two types, first the Diabetes Type 1 that is predent in childrens, pacient needs insuline every day, also this diabetes is caused by the destruction of the insuline realized by the person´s immuny siste. You could buy tickets, shop, talk with friends, and have fun just by sitting on a @CAPS8. On one hand you put all your things in the car and drive anywhere you want to, on the other hand if you feel not very well to drive, you have no money to buy a car or the downtown of your city is closed for all the means of transport except for the public ones: tram, bus or trolley bus is your wayout. @PERCENT4 of the people who use computers are obese or overweight. Peole spend less time interacting with friends and family and enjoying nature. In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people and parents should control their child's time on the computers. The most important step is inspect the notes which are good quality sheets and which are bad sheets.If the sheets are good,those sheets are then cut into separately and packed into cars in order to dispatach all over the city.If the sheets are bad,those sheets are then destroyed through burning. So @CAPS9 you think you are addicted, try to make a time schedule for your whole day. I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens.So I do not agree with this afirmation, in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport. Addiction, online bullying, and becoming overweight is not the only problems of a @CAPS8, there are many more."	3.5

"Dear @LOCATION1, I want you to imagine it's a beautiful @DATE1 day. Fifty minutes passed ,when my body no longer was sore.I decided to walk to the end.Constantly,I just walked like without terminal contest.While I strugged to walk.Finally,I saw a light to appeare my eyes and I woke up. If you want we could go to the capital city of my country, we will go by the car because the car is cheaper than the bus or train, we could eat in the famous restaurant of the city or we could go to the cinema also if you want I could visit the medieval wall. When people are engrossect with whatever they @MONTH1 be doing on the computer they become very lazy, they lose the motivation to go out and exercise, people also lose intrest in helping around the community. Good day, My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport, Volleyball one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to practise  this sport 3 times a week since 1980,  the reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as follows : 1- make me fit and healthy  2- classy game no friction between players  3- it exercise all muscles of your body Regarding the above I advice all rookies to start practise this sport and they will get many benefits. Statics shows that @PERCENT1 of people would rather stay instead on the computer then out and about helping and working around their neighboorhood. Computers have had such a negative impact it makes people want to stay glued to their chairs with their eyes glued to their monitors. Yes computers have had a lot to do with a lot of technical advances, but at what cost do these technological advances come? Many kids are becoming obese and lack my motivation to come out of their room off of the computer. Computers are making society very lazy this is why they have a negative impact on us. Computers have also made society lack motivation to go and exercise. It is true that we are a lot of users that want to use the car but, and that amount is  growing up; as well there are a lot of people that don't have the posibility to have a car and some use the public transportation because many reasons like the price, because it is easier to get to the place by public transportation rather than car, because the traffic, some times for people it is so exhausting to drive lots of hours an even some times the public transportation is faster. She was lazy and never wanted to exercise. Instead of going out and doing something about it, she stayed in her room on facebook for weeks at a time. Though the computer wasnt the one who made her obese, it was used as a much to hide behind the real problems. It is sad when @PERCENT2 of teenagers say they would rather stay inside on myspace than going outside for a jogg. Yes its true computers helps you learn things you @MONTH1 not have known before, but so do books, newspapers and magazines. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Helping out in your community provides many opportunties to meet new people, and it feel a sense of accomplishment. But the urge to stay in on the computer clouds your better judgement. I know that I would rather help the elemntry school across the street build a new garden rather than stay inside on twitter. After waiting an hour the time comes and bravely  with high confident level he walke to the office. Helping around your community lets people know you care about whats going on. It is a time when children must choose, which people are good or bad, which way they will go to difficult situation for example they will be drink alcohol or they will have fun without any suplements. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Teenagers as well as adults have become very lazy. Three robots in specific hour make a show with instruments like a band.Foxy the pirate makes a show individually in her pirate cove, The children loves Foxy because plays with the kids making questions about the pirates and count a pirate story. Now its your turn don't just stare at your computer screen absent mindley. Go out and toss the ball along with the neighbors dog. When I want studying for exams  going to the living room and sitting front of TV In addition, there is a small blackboard for my littel brother because my mother wants my prother learn Arabic and English letters."	3.5

"Computers are used everywhere, for thousands of different things. Many of @LOCATION1 spend hours glued to our computer screen everyday. Being very reliant on your computer is not always good for you. @DATE1 too many people spend countless hours on their computers, rather than doing other activities. the most family member I love and think she is the best friend of mine , my sister , she is elder me about 12 years , I can tell her any thing about my life , my self , my feelings ,hhh also i think if i felt in love she would be the first to know that . First, when spending days on your keyboard you will have less time to run or play with your friends. Michael decided to open the door and back for her, he thought better the things he do not want to leave her again, he like her, he knows himself and he wants to know her, he have kept all his feelings for a long time. Perhaps a reason for this is that too many people can just sit on their laptops to shop, see movies, and even to get a college education. Less and less people go for walks because they would rather be on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. Without the constant use of computers there would be more free time for people to get outside, or play sports. Secondly, many kids and teens are attached to their laptop, and bring it everywhere with them. So, rather than studying for their tests, they could be on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. For all the people I advise to start to play or watching football because for me it is a very good sport , but you can play a good football only if you really like it , because first football is fun . Plus, spending so many hours on a computer. think has a future that all people use public transport then I think that maybe continue to have future but has bad and good things , for example good is easier to move in the city and you save time, and the bad , bad people attack you and steal things, but I thing ,that have future ,because a lot people even they use public transport to. Computers take away their time that could be used towards getting a college education, why waste them? Our Mistakes mistake made us better than before if in life we had't got any mistake  we wouldn't succeed that's why  the mistakes are very important in life and I believe  our mistake improve us so but in another way there just one mistake and you could not come back or arranged your mistake Many people @DATE1 are staying inside on their laptops to talk to a person rather than doing it face to face. he said kindly:""I buy you a present,open it,Tom"" Tom opened the big bag,Oh!This is a big surprise,there was a football in it,which he always wanted to buy there were some words goal!keep doing! This loss of skill, could lead to a generation of more cyber talk rather than @CAPS3. In conclusion, why spend so many hours on the computer when you could be outside, or hanging out with friends? Personally I'd prefer to go and do something rather than being stuck inside on a computer."	3.5

"Dear Newspaper, Have you notice that now a days more and more people are becoming overweight? Well its true. People say that it is because of eat a lot of fast food but I think that since we are always on the computer and not excersing helps contribute to it. Also as the technology is getting better it is keeping people from going outside and enjoying the beautiful nature. Sitting infront of the computer isn't going to help our environment. Lastly, kids aren't getting out of their house to interact with friends and family because technology has been able to let us communicate without leaving our house. @CAPS1 not saying that we should downgrade our technology, but we need to find a way limit it. To start on with, technology has a role in the increasing rate of obesity. It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs.In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us.In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable. As a kid myself, I love to be on the computer. To begin with,the format of the bank notes needs to be designed,factors of considerations including the background colour,the artwork and the security issues.Sencondly,equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps.Thirdly,print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink,where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes. I think that other people could feel this way so thats why we need to limit the computer. i don't know my name .i don't know my age all i know about that i want to be a great woman ,i want the world to hear my voice , to prove that i can do it  i can do any thing  i am not weak i have woman power @CAPS2, you @MONTH1 be able to look up ways to stop global warming, but does it mean you are going to really do it? Some @MONTH1 not because they could just stay on the computer and keep ""@CAPS3 up"" ways to help another things is that when we use our computers, we use electricity, which adds to global warming so it we limit the use of computers then people could go enjoy nature and not destroy it. Lastly, internet sites like myspace, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc have allowed us to communicate with friends and family but we are still not able to get out and interact with them. When we get out and interact with our friends we gain like communication teamwork and respect friend and family can teach you this with them the computer they can't. People complaint about how the information about different TV shows don't contribute in the process of learning, that's why many of This programmes are considered trash, because of the multiples shows such as realities, talk shows,or showbiz that hardly ever have a good message or something interesting for people. Interacting with friends & family is better than talk thru the computer. A few minutes ago,some boy who looks  like elderly than my old brother closed to the poor little boy,the little boy stopped cried,he looked on some boy,my brother felt afraid because they look like rube,but he still  wanted help the little boy. So we need to act now limit compute usage!"	3.5

More environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of themthere is to that we have a center of care and, other more institutions, we also make environmental protection centers were people can visit and learn about this to sum up our village is very concentrated on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us KAIST has very formal time-table. People who reach 18 have to complete military service is an issue, the supporters suggest that is helpful for the 18 to train the physical fitness and psychological quality, whilst opponents point out that is harmful for the human right and affect development of the country. Also they end up together. Plus, same classes are pair like Monday and Wednesday. Some students think it is our university's advantage, but I disagree. If I could change one important thing about KAIST, I would change the formal time-table for these three reasons. First of all, lots of classes start and finish together has many disadvantage. For example, lunch time is between second and third classes. So every students has to wait for a line, eat, and brush their teeth in just one hour. Firstly,the city of Vancouver has a programme called go green Vancouver that it will protect the environment selecting the rubbish by containers at the same time there is a collaboration from the city hall of any district that it will provided a 3 containers for each house one for papers one for bottles y the last one for rubbish materials. Also, before class starts, many students want to ride OLEV. In all over the world people always need advices to keep looking after their environments .First ,the municipal should do workshops in schools and universities providing students by tips that should help us to make our environment clean .Second ,they should make awareness campaigns about environment ;for example , telling people to put their rubbish in waste papre basket which helping workers to recycling it easily .Finally ,to stay healthy we need a healthy environment . Hence, some students can not ride it. Second, it ruins balance of time. The service is very bad the drivers are very angry and stressed out these do not lead with cauition, in Toluca exist report of high rates of accidents by buses. Usually, there are no class on Friday. Also, classes end up at least 4 PM except advanced English classes, and no classes after 4 pm. The picture below illustrates how to make bank notes.First is to design the note,including background color,artwork and security issues.Second is to prepare mental plates as well as qulified machinists.Then is printing with special ink.When the one side is printed,raising the images slightly to make opposite to be colored.Last is the key step,inspection.It is of importance to inspect the printed sheets.If the sheet is good or partialy damaged,it can be packed and delivered by veichals after cutted in to separate notes.Otherwise ,the sheets and notes would be abandoned and destroyed in the fire. If time-table would be more free, students could take lecture for 5 days, or late time. It could reduce students' stress of study. Lastly,  schedule of test is too tight for some students. Because regular classes' schedule is formal, exams' schedule is formal too. ?XD)Cherry blossom is very beautiful but there are so many people.When we went to Sun Moon Lake by cable car,wind is so strong!I felt a little nervous though the scenery amazing.All in all,I stil have a memorable vacation. many countries are truly started to concern no environment and worried about the globe warming ,In schools teachers are doing their best  to educate children how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy,also they train them how to plant trees in public gardens of their towns ,Although  government strict so many laws and taxes in the people how do not pay their taxes to the council for cleaning of the rubbish from towns and villages,in the biggest polluted city in the world people started to use bicycles and cycling instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city,also they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive. Another class which starts at 2:30 pm, its exam start at 4 pm. Then student has only 15 minutes to prepare the next exam. To summarize, formal time-table makes tight schedule, and ruins balance of time. In this aspect, I strongly support the idea for change our school's time-table."	3.5
472	"Government: Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.        "	"I used my car every day however few a few I started to take public transport for I can to save up money Basically, science fiction is based on scientific facts, but it also contains some scientific errors. When I saw the advertisement about the job in this moment I think that is very easy ,I called the number,they give me the information and I accept. For example, many people believe that there are many minerals or resources to use in outer space; that's not true. Government should spend money for our basic needs on Earth rather than space exploration with two reasons. First of all, using resources in outer space is inefficient. NASA or other organizations found some planets which have resources. However, according to NASA, it takes over thousands year to reach, even the speed of spaceship reaches to light. This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. In all over the world people always need advices to keep looking after their environments .First ,the municipal should do workshops in schools and universities providing students by tips that should help us to make our environment clean .Second ,they should make awareness campaigns about environment ;for example , telling people to put their rubbish in waste papre basket which helping workers to recycling it easily .Finally ,to stay healthy we need a healthy environment . Next, space is mostly unknown and dangerous. There are many harms that we already know: thin air, strong ultraviolet rays, black holes, and so on. Life is unpredictable and unforseen.The immense possibilities of life  give us opportunity to explore life but some times   it lead to threat and dangers to our life.We surely pray for the best life of our dear and near ones.But insurance is also necessity and invetable for peace of mind .It gives us surety to live life securely.It just not only to save our life but also secure assets like houses cars etc. Also, research for the space are unclear before they confirm the appearance through their own eyes. In my opinion ,Volleyball must then be considered among high-risk sports according to the frequency and gravity of our surgical findings.my advice for who starts this sport you will get fresh after you play this game and makes you doing your work in relaxetion way . Some people said that development of  space technology would make the exploration more efficient. However, there is a limitation. According to Einstein, every materials' speed is limited until the speed of light. Therefore, we cannot make any spaceships that can move over the light speed, which means time for migration between outer planet will not decrease dramatically. To sum up, development of outer space technology is inefficient and uncertain. On the other hand, it's possible to solve the poverty and cure the incurable illnesses by using that budget. Today personal vehicle become pride of the life , mean if a person is on there personal vehicle they are look as higher status in the society . Humankind should solve these problems before the development of outer space. It might be more helpful to humankind."	3.5
473	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"Personally, I think it is important for university students to have a part-time job because of the following reasons. First of all, since graduation from high school, most of the parents will stop giving their sons/daughters money. Also, just for young children that are in process of growth and development, physical exercise is essential to do it, because they can have a healthier life.Young children try to effort, and wants to win at this age, and if they train results were better and encourages to keep training.In psychic way, if you are adapated forms relations and create new friends. So getting a part-time job is exactly the way to solve this problem. Secondly, most of the university students will buy a lot of things like Iphone, Macbook, cell phone, clothings, etc. we will know today some of information about Islam , Islam is great religion come from The Arabian Peninsula and its founded since 1436 years ago. Thirdly, having a part-time job is a way to use the time wisely for university students. For example, they may have some day-offs every week as there are no lessons on that day, then it is quite common that they want to have something to do rather than staying at home on that day. In the future,people will go out of the Earth .Because of the damage,people on the ground can't survive.When they want to find foods,there will be nothing.Even of the grass can't alive on earth.Thought,but most people do not be the member of the team of alive.Cause of lots of damage,but they didn't Take responsibility.I wonder for sixteen years.And I don't know if they were change their mind in after the next fifty years. In conclusion, it is important for university students to have a part-time job simply because of economic concern."	3.5
474	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Coat of arms of the city of Rybinsk is a scarlet heraldic shield,over which - green with golden beach pier for which the output is black rebelling bear holding in the left leg on the left shoulder golden ax, undertwo silver starlet What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player ,i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families, Moreover, a large number of restaurants are within an enclosed space or building. Already public transport have been improvement and that makes comfortable to go on a trip,but I think that will be able to become good quality more and more,because so many people expectation. Also, bans are merely placed on all restaurants; it's not the entire country. Smokers can still have their puff after their meal. Surely they are not that addicted to smoking such that they can't spare a good 10-20 minutes for their meal. From the business perspective, I would have to segregate areas for smokers and non smokers as having a smoking area might play a part in deciding on where to dine. Adolescent has always been the hardest part throughout anybody's whole life.. turning out in a fleeting glimpse into an adult, perceiving the other side of life,how tough and complicated it is, trying to deal with its different circumstances.. at this point you merely have a brief look at your whole life, many questions spinning in your head, accusing yourself of being a lost cause, wishing if you could turn the clock back,,but it's all no good.. then you find yourself standing ahead clouds of reality, which sucks.. life is stages, this stage of your life is timeless, no way out.. at some point you wish if it was all illusio, you need a time machine makes it possible to go back in time when you could see the purity of life.. However..here you are completely different made of life lessons, preferring to make a stiff upper lip..cowering in your own reality. Without the smoking area, you might lose customers who are smokers. With the smoking area, you lose customers who don't appreciate the smoking. And just having two different areas, it costs more to have two different sections. E. g. Having an indoor and outdoor area. This means higher cost for a larger space as it's not possible to segregate 2 distinct areas in an enclosed place. But without the ban on the restaurants, you are able to sell the cigarettes which could boost sales. Overall, it's better not to be placed on restaurants. It benefits the general public and the smoker."	3.5
475	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Did you know that @PERCENT1 @LOCATION1 people use their computers extremely often? Not many people don't have a computer these days and sometimes it's hard to get away from it. I think most people can control themselves, though I believe that computers are very important and also have a positive effect on people. I use the computer to talk with friends and family, to help with my homework, and I am still active. I spend quite a bit @LOCATION1 time on the computer, yet I am still a very active person. I take dance lessons twice a week and when I can. With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of population,many agricultueal land,forest and ocesn had been used to destroyed to build more constructure and transport networks.From my own perspective,I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human  and animals. The creator of the haven and the earth, the creator of soles , the one who make earth rotate around it self and around the sun.What we belief as Muslims that, we have created by one who don't have other with him the one who create our father (Adam ) and created from him (Eve) and they were in the Paradise and instructed to not eat from the tree but the Satan deceive them so they brought to this life and generations came from them and had sent the prophet and messengers ( Moses, Jesus, Mohamed, others.. who they worship the same one) with Miracles and evidence of the truth, to guide the people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to the Paradise and who follow other paths which it will guide to the hell. It @MONTH1 seem like I am on a lot, but really I have something. Also, all my friends are on the computer and some @LOCATION1 them are more active then me. To our relief,she was saved and when we went to granny room,we saw smile on her face.We were also happy,but in Michael head came a lot of things.He knew that if we escape at that moment when the granny was at the ground,she would most probably die.Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. I would definetly say that I interact with my family quite a bit. In a family @LOCATION1 it is kind @LOCATION1 hard not to. Also, I hang out with my friends every chance I get. I interact a lot but the computer lets me talk to them when there not around. Recently when I was in youtube I saw a movie trailer, the film appeared so good and days later my friends told me if I wanted to go them to the cinema, so I decided to go and luckily they had decided to see the film that days before I had seen. The computer lets me communicate with them and even exchange digital pictures. Moreover also simple things are changed, for example the food we eat: some times ago everythingh was natural, healthy... but now everyone eat always ""junk food"" and thinghs like that, which are completely unhealthy ! I used all of the things except two.I didn't have the Internet when I was child.And also we couldn't choose  programmes.I played in the street and walked to school alone.I'm thinking what kind if things were more dangerous for me?It was so dangerous when my friends and I swam in the Tobol river.We jumped into the water and caught crayfish.When I remember that moment I am exciting.I guess everychild want to investigate the world.We have to help them,to show and explain.What kind of risks they can get if to do that. We still got to talk and have a nice conversation. Also 'internet' in our days helps to get information all over the world, and if you wish to get involved then go to the www.bbc.co.uk.These sites are free way to find most adequate information about actual events both in society and technical life. my mom keeps the books and managers many things for a company. She spends a lot @LOCATION1 time on the computer whether she likes it or not. This really cannot be helped. Sometimes it is just necessary. Also, teachers use it to help them teach classes and prepare materials for it. As s result, I use it for homework. I @MONTH1 need to check my homework, research a topic, or use it for help. I think the computer is absolutely necessary and is a very irresplaceable piece @LOCATION1 technology. I'm sure you will now agree that computers are helpful, not harmful. As long as you get equal amounts @LOCATION1 fresh air and family interaction, they have a very positive on people's lives."	3.5
476	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Do citizens have the right to remove books, magazines, and other materials from shelves because they personally do not agree with the content? Censorship in libraries is a subject with an unclear answer. Some believe it is in their right to get rid of books, music, and movies with what they believe is 'offensive' material. Others think library censorship is wrong, that people should have access to whatever material they please. Censorship is simply a way of preventing knowledge from those who wish to learn more about worlds outside their own. As well, we have to promote that the people get jobs close their accommodation or get the accommodation close to the jobs, because we have too much pollution and we could reward the companies that hire staff close to the place of job, maybe in a circle of 4 kilometres, as well we could reward the people that turn their accommodation for live near to the job or for going  there by a bicycle. Maintaing cars are expensive.Public transport you do not need to worry about any petrol filling, checking tyre pressures, getting tired after driving long journey.In future cutting down public transport affects many of the people.Elderly people wont able to drive always depends on public transport.If public transport stop services people who are not able to drive will  affect a lot. Library censorship is a way to keep this 'unsuitable' material away from young and curious eyes. However, what @MONTH1 be unacceptable for children to view @MONTH1 be perfectly fine for a mature adult. Censorship is purely opinion. If a person is a strict believer that @CAPS1 created the world in seven days, they might find it offensive to see a book or a movie that supports the theory of evolution. But, in this moment the people think different, is to start to help the world and  Contamination is big problem for us and the planet. However, I think the tools should be improved, such as killer’s knife and actors'costumes, the knife looks like as brittle as a handicraft, I believe those are seconded-handed clothing. If a person does not wish to have access to certain 'offensive' subjects, then they do not have to expose themselves to it. But it is not in their rights to remove it from the view of others who @MONTH1 wish to educate themselves on the said matters. Writing is a form of self- expression, a method by which to convey feelings and thoughts and share them with others. It is also a way to teach and to inform others about the past. But if what is written is not shared, how can one form their own opinions and thoughts when they are not exposed to the opinions of those outside their community? It is unfair to prevent someone from learning about a certain subject simply because one or two other people oppose the content. If books and movies containing information unacceptable to one person were removed, then everyone else has the right to have material of their choice removed as well. The biggest anecdote, that I have with my friend, was our trip to Disney world.Where we could visit all the parks of Disney , like Animal Kingdom ,Hollywood studios and Magic kingdom.In adittion we could visit others parks, like Universal and Bush Garden. That is one of the beauties of being an @CAPS6 citizen: freedom of speech. You should knew about the prize for coming to the museum is very cheap ($15.00) for hour if you want to stay more time the prize increase in $10.00. Censorship prevents learning from those who want it. Above all,the design is the most previous way we should know,which is considered with the background color and artwork.Secondly,we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinsts.And the we need printing and inspection.Eventually,the most essential part comes out,we need significate the quality of the sheets.If it's good,packing and distributin whereas the others shoulde be distroyed as well. Not wanting their children to be exposed to explicit or graphic material is understandable. But just because they do not want their child to see a movie about devil worship or the @CAPS7 era does not mean the parent has the right to prevent all others from seeing it. In the end, large colleges admit largest number of students, so the student may do establishing friendships more from different nationalities, also it serves the community by graduating many students in various majors. Libraries provide a source by which young people can educate themselves on the religions, beliefs, and customs of the outside world. It should not be up to the parents to decide what is put on the library shelves; if they do not want their children to have access to certain subjects, do not allow them to go to the library. In conclusion, one can say library censorship is a matter of opinion. Citizens have a right to read, listen to, or watch whatever material they please. Granted, it is acceptable for parents to shield their children from certain subjects, but it is unaccepable for those same parents to prevent others in the community from learning. Freedom to express one's opinions in the form of literature means nothing if that literature cannot be shared with others. As Katherine Paterson once said, '... And then we have no bookes left of the shelf for any of us."	3.5

"Some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on computers, and I believe that they are correct. Most kinds would perfer to be on the computer chatting with friends on line or spending hours on facebook but what is the point of this when there is a whole to explore, they don't enjoy natire like they should, and they spend less time with family and friends. If you are on the computer twenty four hours a day, seven days a week how are you supposed to get enough exersize? Well that's the problem you don't get any exersize. Some might disagree with me but the truth is, moving your hand over the mouse doesn't count! think has a future that all people use public transport then I think that maybe continue to have future but has bad and good things , for example good is easier to move in the city and you save time, and the bad , bad people attack you and steal things, but I thing ,that have future ,because a lot people even they use public transport to. @CAPS2 is sad to think that technology has taken over so much that @CAPS2 is ruining poeples lives. I go in the computer @CAPS1 too, but I am always sure to ride my bike after or go for a hike with my family @CAPS1 of the times I have softball practice so I'm not able to go on the computer anyway. Now what about the beautiful things in nature @CAPS1 of us are missing? The outdoors is one thing most of us take advantage on, some of us have @CAPS3 seen a day-lily are at night and new ones grow the very next day. This a facinating are might @CAPS3 see because they have a computer screen in front of their face. Kids really should learn to balance tecknology and the more important things in life like protecting nature and exercising. Yes, I know, that some will disagree by saying, ""but i am saying the rain forest, or the @LOCATION1, by being a member of this website."" @CAPS2's true you are helping but doing @CAPS2 yourself would feel a whole lot better. For example you could get a group and clean up the streets in your neighborhood or help plant trees in the park. Her mom tried to tell Fernanda that they arrived very late because they had a very perplexed problem, so her mom told her that they came out from the park at 9:00pm it was still late but not too late, so they were on the street and the police arrived because they police thought that she had a globe with wine, and her mother told the police that she doesn't have alcohol or wine on her car, and they police didn't believed her and they took them to the police station so they could check his car, and about 10 minutes approximately they told her that she didn't have nothing so they, went from there to their house and it was late, so that’s the reason. If you loose everything what is the one thing your will always have? In later time, society feel the need for change about iniquities that pass in the country and the Mexican Revolution explotes, the building is abandoned because the government and country dont have money for construction, to the point the building  metal estructure was used as weapons. If family is so importand then why would kid want to be on the computer than at a family picnic? Is is because technology is taking over their life and clouding their vision of the more important things life has to offer. Don't you sometimes wish you were a little kid again running bare footed a field with your parents? The last mistake that I have had to have been when I changed the telephone company because since I changed I have many troubles. In the end,if it is a good sheet,the porcedure is packaging and distribution,including cutting into separate bank notes,packing,dispatching.If it is a bad sheet,the porcedure is disposal    --bad sheetsand bank notes should be securely destroyed. I know that a ton of people are going to disagree with me when they read this but, I think technology is ruining some peoples lives. If you think about @CAPS2 a computer is like a @CAPS4-@CAPS5 @CAPS6 , @CAPS2 has a sugar sweet coating byt when you get the full force of @CAPS2, @CAPS2 traps you in and won't let go. A computer is ruining lives and experts have a right to be worried about people's health!

"Dear Jo, As you know, my grandmother actually lives in France with my cousint Jonh, unfortunately he has to make three months course outside of the country, Jonh will leave France next weekend, but instead it is not possible, I have to go and look after her because none of my family cant waist three months over there. Suddenly we heard the sound of running footsteps.Then there was a cry and the footsteps stopped.Nervously,we walked back.Perhaps someone had been killed,or kidnapped in the street We were going to see what happened ,and we had something to see.There was one old granny who was beat up.We try to gave her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that.Than we were trying to find help ,but nobody was opening doors.On our luck I had a mobile phone ,but Michael was saying that we need to escape because we did not know are those bullies near the corner.My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I've done that. so it become a fashion of using personal vehicle which create a lot of problem big one traffic problem..... now traffic problem is the biggest problem. Second, it lets people communicate with other people. I think in the future don't exist public transport because we will drive their car.When you drive your own transport ,a car for example, you going to from a specificlly place but in a bus you go to the bus stop and no to your house or school, work... It is better from the people be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person. As you can see this is why I believe it is positive. There is a man who is most important for one's life.I am not different from that.there is a back stairs influence    in my life he is none but my father.I respect him so much and admire also.He is my best friend who never hurts me.He always helps me by giving good advance.He is an ideal farmer who never and even tells a lie.His means of livelihood is the simplest.He always honors the oldest and taught us of avoiding tells a lie.so far as I remember one day he was advising me suddenly a old man entered the conversation and told a foolish speech. On the top of the steps is the inspectation by hands, that is to say, they should be separated into well-qualified ones,which are to be cut into bank notes,and delivered to the banks and the bad ones which can't be utilited are fired definitely at the last stage. I bought shoes, clothes and GPS watch,I told myself:now it is a challenge, I must defeat myself .The first day is so painful, I was tired to die when I just ran nearly 3km, but things becomes better and better, and now I could run 10km. This helps because you saw something and didn't need to see where you were moving the mouse to click on it. Also it helps because when you are typing a paper you don't need to look at the keys to know what to type. You can look at the screen and move your fingers freely. As you can see this is my first reason as to why I believe computers are positive. Second, computers help people communicate with others. This can be important if you need to talk to someone that lives far away. If someone lives to far away and their is something important then the @CAPS7 is great. You can send people @CAPS3 or even @CAPS4 chat someone. It helps communication so much that you have choices on how you want to talk to someone. Third, it helps people with school and sometimes work. It helps people because they could @CAPS2 projects. This can be helpful to learn about places you didn't even know existed. One time I was wondering what people from @LOCATION1 did to live and survive. Being @CAPS5, I just had to know. I went on the computer and in about a half hour I knew exactly what and how @CAPS5 people did to live and survive. This could also help at work because it your boss is counting on you to have work done, you can use the @CAPS7. As you can see this is my third and final reason as to why I believe computers are positive. Michael decided to open the door and back for her, he thought better the things he do not want to leave her again, he like her, he knows himself and he wants to know her, he have kept all his feelings for a long time. First, they can help to improve hand-eye coordination. Second, they help people communicate with people from other areas. Third, it helps with school and work. i was at this team for 5 years and the made me even better in football.I played my first match at 16 years old and i felled very special because i was 16 and i was capable of putting 3 goals. In fact the are the best bet for a better future."	3.5

"Dear The @CAPS1, People have been saying that computers are not beneficial, but they are wrong. In my opinion computers are very beneficial. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about other people and faraway places, also, you can use the internet to interact with friends and family. Computers can be very useful and efficient to anybody. Did you know that computers can teach hand-eye coordinaiton? Some computers have programs that teach you how to type. Without having to lock down at the keyboard. And to day is necessary because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversation with their you need to now more than your foreign language, because in the rest of the world and particularly in Europe people now more than two language and that great. Secondly, do more cooperation between countries.To illustrate, people should cooperation To intervene to bring peace to the world to stop the war in many areas like what United Nations doing.For example, United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy . Computers are very needed all around the world. Computers give people the ability to learn about other people and places. one day Michael decided to make a surprise party to sinha to make her happy and feel his love more so he arranged everything and to keep it surprise to her he was busy all the time and did not show off all the week as usual .that make sinha worried and suspect that Michael do not love her any more and know another girl and she become extremely sad and even it become worse when Michael asked her to go to his apartment to make  the surprise to her  but he did not answer his phone after that . Children and adults need computers because if for example, a child get a project from schoool that need to be done about a famous person or smoking. she would most likely need to go to the internet .

They can communicate via e-mail, @CAPS2, video and maybe even in other web sites. Some web sites contain the ability to talk to each other through video or through messages, such as @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. People like using the computer because it is very useful when you need it most. If you ask anyone they will tell you that having a computer is very important and necessary. This helicopter had humid then the helicopter star to rotate in all the island then the helicopter go sinking in the water then the hurricane finished  the engineers start to distribute the food and medicine. Let me explain my reasons, when you drive your car you can take it from your garage or in the main door of your house and it gets you whatever you want, but on the other hand if you take public transport it will be much more uncomfortable because you must catch the bus in the bus stop... where is your nearest bus stop? They give poeple and places in the world.

480	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Even now, many people buy lotteries and hope to win them. My advice to travel for Spain is that there are several types of transport but the most economic is the public, most expensive transport can be the taxi, for example.But, you can travel by plane,it is not very expensive. In spite of the belief, success does not live in a casino thus not come from taking risks or chances. Secondly, it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting a time in waiting a specific time to move or even waste a time in waiting a public transportation to reach all point it should get it , but in the other side when  you have your own transport or a private transport is get a right to choose time of trip or when you want to move or stay, and nowadays we cannot waste our time in taking public transport. Firstly,the growing number of private cars cause the big problem with traffic jam .People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam.That wastes people's time and make people feel exhausted.Not mention to say,it's definitely hard to enjoy travelling in holidays.Secondly,private  cars are the main reason for the air pollution.We should consider the protection of environment for human future,not only care about the convenience we can see for now. First, some people say that they are miserable and hopeless, so they can never succeed without fortunes. But success does not follow money; It follows an achievement. No one say that winning a lottery is an achievement. To achieve something, one need to make a plan and stick to the plan. It takes time and sweat. One might take risks and fortunately win money, but it would never give any sense of success. Having plans, in addition, make the success not to go away. One important property of success is continuity; it must not vanish. Success from careful planning never disappears but rather keeps growing. The One of the most amazing thing that attractive you, is that it has  safari  which is more enjoyable thing ,at the sometime,it is introducing you to a wildlife  without needs to go out from your city. On the other hand, one who choose to take risks can lose everything in any moment. It is not success; it is just a dream. To maintain the success, making plan is necessary. Furthermore, having plans reduces the uncertainty and helps people to deal with unexpected situation. With clear goals, one can visualize their success and manage their resources appropriately. Let me explain my reasons, when you drive your car you can take it from your garage or in the main door of your house and it gets you whatever you want, but on the other hand if you take public transport it will be much more uncomfortable because you must catch the bus in the bus stop... where is your nearest bus stop? My advice to travel for Spain is that there are several types of transport but the most economic is the public, most expensive transport can be the taxi, for example.But, you can travel by plane,it is not very expensive. I used my time efficiently, which leads to more study and good grades. There were some unexpected events in the semester, but I always had enough time to deal with them. Suddenly,a rube boy grabbed the little boy 's clothes,the little boy was cried loudly,my brother was outrege,ran to the rube boy and attached  him. To get and maintain success, making plans is nessesary. Success always visits whoever is ready and prepared. With own study plans, students would get good grades this semester."	3.5
481	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player ,i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families, Thousands upon thousands of sites and applications are now at your fingertips. I firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelming positive. For one thing, they increase hand-eye coordination.For another, they are a great means of communication.Finally they are a very powerful research tool. Some @MONTH1 say that computers are lessening time with family and friends, but I don't agree. We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben, which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye.To got to the Big Ben we took the underground, but to get to the London Eye a red bus.After 3 days we went home.I forgot to tell you something about homeless people.A lot of people are homeless, which is sad, but maybe we can change it. For another,there are many different types of programs,which can broaden our eyes,they give details of education,plus other meaningful information，such as documentaries，talk show and so on.These programs are not just for killing the time,but for educating. First of all, computers are great for increasing hand-eye coordination. In recent study by @PERSON1, he noticed a significant increase in motor skills of children aged @NUM1 to @NUM2 when they used educational computer programs such as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for just half an hour, once a day. Children who did not use the program were seen to develop motor skills at a much lower rate. Hand-eye coordination is a skill needed from birth to death, and should be encouraged as uch as possible. My name is Anna,I am a very cheerful person and I have a creative personality so I enjoy planning activities or organise sport events in a special and  colorful way.I really love childrens and take care of them ,I also had an experience  of working in summer camps and have a good experience doing delicious food because I already did this stuff in other camps.I think that I gave good reasons and I hope that you will accept me. As you can see, hand-eye coordination is very important. Second in my reasoning is that computers are brilliant communication aids. Playing the cricket will also gives physical exercise to our body.we can bowl,batt,field in the cricket which  requires lot of  physical activities. An email could be waiting for them online whenever - and whereever - they check @CAPS1. public transport is very crowded so you may not have a seat .I hate public transport as I was attacked by mad man once .also taxi is  not a good transport .I wish I have my own car soon to get rid of public transport . Revolutionary video-conferencing programs like @ORGANIZATION2 can even allow us to talk to people around the world, practically eye to eye. I use @CAPS1 to keep in touch with family on the @LOCATION2. How about you? Last - but (at the risk of sounding cliched) definitely not the least - computers are very powerful research tools. Everything from the schedule of the local zoo (thus preventing toddler meltdowns when one arrives only to find @CAPS1 closed) to the average life span of the @CAPS4 elephant (@NUM3 years). Rather than skimming book after books for a single piece of information, plug your query into any of many search engines, from @ORGANIZATION1 to @CAPS5., and find answers instantly. I think one of my favorites sports of all is the atletism I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself, you have to be every day better than you where yesterday, it force you to improve every time, also is an exercise that help all your body, especially the legs because it gives them great strength, but also your hands because they have to be in a constant movement, and all the body in general because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and help you to have coordination. and we must lern children that clean is necessary for their health and on their school they should throw rubbish on Waste basket and who throw it on the ground Will be punished . I used my car every day however few a few I started to take public transport for I can to save up money In conclusion, computers are a great resource that are often wrongly portrayed in a bad light. Computers teach and improve valuable hand-eye coordination. Also, they help greatly with communication. To begin with is design,we are able to considerate backgroud colour ,artwork,and security issues,and then,we are supposed to preparing mental plates,such as skilled and machinists. Computers are oftern shown as the bane of society. This is simply untrue. They are an excellent tool for all ages. Technology is not our enemy. Don't treat @CAPS1 like one."	3.5

"FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY´S all begins in 1981 when freddy fazbear's pizza open, the establishment it's a pizza restaurant but this pizza restaurant in had robots, in 1981 there were four animatronics and their names are Chica , Foxy, Bonnie and Freddy. I thought that computers are very helpful. Secondly, it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting a time in waiting a specific time to move or even waste a time in waiting a public transportation to reach all point it should get it , but in the other side when  you have your own transport or a private transport is get a right to choose time of trip or when you want to move or stay, and nowadays we cannot waste our time in taking public transport. The other chart is about employer support, under 26 years old is the most higterst because it almost have 70%, the scentd higterst is age 26-29 years old; it has 50% of people are taken; niy yhe most lower is 35% age of group are 30-39 years old. Computers are excellent tools that could help students with work in school. Most people say that using public transport is better than using cars, and they say that its cheaper and better for the environment, about me I think that cars is easier and affordable way to transport between places, because cars is here any time and so near to your home instead of public transportation which you should take a walk to reach it in most countries, and also cars available all the time, you can go at 4 am and no one say anything, because its yours, but most public transportation is available only for the day hours and few hours at night, in emergency situation for example, what you will do, if you do not have your own car, your kid is sick, or you wife or your old parents, and in general the more we depend on ourselves the more our government able to help the poverty and homeless people out there, who really need more help and aid from the public community, we merely ask the government to improve streets and the traffic light systems, and more oil stations and parking in the streets, to be able to drive and move easy and safe and in a short time. One of my interests in reading, @CAPS1 I had to research about how reading a simple back can be related to science. I went on the internet, typed in my question about reading, and two seconds later thousands of results up. I had even gotten some pictures too. A couple of days later after I had handed in my project, I recieved it back. I had gotten a @NUM1 on this project! @CAPS1 being able to use a computer really boosted my grade in science. If difficulties was told to the families, the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation. As you can see, computers can help students with projects, etc. in school. Using this technology can help you reconnect with friends and family members. In elementary school, my friend @PERSON1 had moved away to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2. in a car accident , when she her what happened with her brother she was so nervous then the miracle happened she found a big suitcase in the train she decided to open the bag because no one was in the train so she opened the bag she surprised when she saw  a lot of money inside the bag  . For one, the show played on television may enlight us and give us some enlightenment.Teleplay are not just for fun,it can have a deep meaning,short story tells big deal,just like a useful book.So,why not television cannot educate us? I don't see @PERSON1 as often as I had used to, but with my computer wide open in my bedroom I can chat online with her almost everyday. Computers can help re-establish old relationships with friends and family. @CAPS1 communicating on these are also another benefit. Using computers can help enrich peoples minds. For example, in school we use a program called, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4."" @CAPS3 @CAPS4 involves you playing games that help you @CAPS3, and tests when you are ready to take them. Dear Sir or Madam Reference to your advertisement I would like to apply for the position to work in AMERICAN SUMMER CAMPS,I am John from  the capital city of south state in India, I worked in middle aged  school for about 2 years, where I had experience which will be suitable for the current position. After taking multiple tests in subjects such as science, math, and language arts, I now feel confident about taking the @ORGANIZATION1's and I believe I am going to do well on these tests. As you can tell, the tool of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 on the computer can benefit your school grades. The effect computers have an people are that they help and benefit the society. I think that more citizens should own computers because they can expand your knowledge. Tottaly l think changing is ignorable but we can control it to make our life better,specially about food that is most important aspect of ourlife but we don't pay attention to it enough."	3.5
483	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Throughout the years, many events have taken place in our history. This is terrible, you do not have privacy authought the society have a blame, because if they do not take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored. These thoughts, opinions, and facts @MONTH1 be offensive to a select few in our @CAPS2. The question is, 'Should our libraries take these 'offensive' pieces off the shelves?' The simple answer to this highly disputed question is no. as a result of this consumer gets more benefit like lower faire, privacy, freedom and safe travelling.in addition many automobile company launcing new car with affordable price which insiost people to use more and more private vechile. Censoring our libraries creates an illusion of a perfect @CAPS2. If libraries were filled with tasteless articles and perfect fairyland books the library would become a place where reality is not present. Libraries hold information that is raw and true without leaving the facts behind. when he come she start crying and thought he would break up with her and she did not give him a chance to talk or explain anything she started to cry louder and accused him of cheating that make michael astonished how she did not trust in him ,how she thought that about him and he told her that he can not stand that anymore he would break up with her and he left .Michael close the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake Being exposed to offensive material and different viewpoints helps shape ourselves into who we are or will become. To take this away would be harming our development and growth, thus creating an 'imperfect' @CAPS2. With a great effort sate down on the grass, he feels tired, and has a little sensation of pain in his boson, site there with many sounds on air, he star recall...his face is changing is dark, he has now a clear image of all, when opened the door of the house his girlfriend is there dying on the floor, Michael remember all, the fight, the lays, the screams, the knife...the blood; but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. The @CAPS1, @LOCATION1's genocide, and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 are all devastating points in time that can be a touchy subject to one and few people. Most of the labours will probably have been represented by machinery, the people who is lack of academic might be very hard to get a job, the knowledge might be demand if the people live in the future. Losing this information is way for people to not be clearly informed, harming the future outcome of our society. Firstly,hyrid cars only allowed to use during weekends as result of this most people not using there cars all the week. Following your letter , I want to tell you about The apartment is very Beautiful not big or small medium-sized left inside two rooms, a bathroom and a dining hall and an external director categorize overlooking a beautiful view I am sure he will like it  to come and Tri condo b soon ,n the end, I would say that I miss you too much and I hope to see you soon. As people develop their own opinions and views overtime they begin to distinguish the difference between right and wrong. Your rights @MONTH1 be someone else's wrongs. What @MONTH1 be offensive to you, @MONTH1 not be offensive to the person sitting next to you. Quoted by the author Katherine Paterson, '...if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In truth, by removing offensive material from our bookshelves there would be no media left. Not everyone will have the same opinion on matters that hold importance, but that is why the @CAPS2 goes around. We as a society have the right to guard our ability to share opinions, censorship destroys our ability to do so. Everyone is different. The @CAPS2 is full of diversity and viewpoints that are bursting with interesting concepts. By censoring records of history, opinion, observations, our @CAPS2 becomes an illusion. We need to have these facts available to the general public. one day he got fight with her sister, even he made her cry.both of them stop talking to each other and after some day the boy need laptop of her sister sukh. My favourit sport is football i love it so much when i was young i used to watch football and my favorite team is Barcelona i was play with my friends at the street and we was happy with that so much and after that we played at playground like really football i love Cristiano Ronaldo so much he is the best player at the world a few people telling me that messi is the best player but i feel angry when i hear that because that is not true so i looking forward to meet my best player one day its like a dream to me ."	3.5

"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 the fresh air that cools your skin and the wind blowing through your hair while you are running side by side next to your best friend. And you think about the millions of people who spend their time chating on the computer. You also wonder about the amount of exercise those people would have, and would they be able to interact with friends and family members. Just think about your current lifestyle is it occupied with computers or is it free and wild? When you think about chatting to people do you think communicating in person or communicating by aim? I have surveyed friends and resulted with five out of ten go home and chat to friends online. looking at the information in more detail.Initially,bank note should be considered the design such as background colour ,artwork,and security issues.then,the preparation of metal plates is next stage.bank note should be skilled and machinists.thereafter,this stage is printing .worker should pay attention to colour on both sides,special ink , and images slightly raised. I asked question like ""what do you do at home? "", ""are you a computer geek?"". It is large, clean and  comforktable and has air conditioning and internet wifi  it introduces many kinds of delicious foods like meat, cheeken ,sea foods and if you want anything different you will find it  there .it is suitable for my class because it is difference from any other restaurant The amount of exercise a person gets depends on who it is. There are some who live on their computers like the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 (a comcast commercial) and some who don't know what a computer is (not commenting). First, you should know is the weather, we have a very cold winter and a hot summer compared with the other countries in the middle east.If you want a city with sea you should choose any city in the west or east of Saudi Arabia.Riyadh is the capital City it's in the center of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.All the stores and malls are closed at mid night include the five prays breaks because we need to go for pray for work you need to know what the major you want to work in so I can help you to search for a good job matching you abilities. the tecnology have chanched the people's life very much.in fact we can think how different is our life respect either to our parents or our grandparents life.for example my parents didn't whacth on tv, because there wasn't any tv on the world when they were young.but it isn't the alone difference:we can think at the mobilefone,the computer ed at least the internet.our grandparents woundn't imagine a strange machine like computer in their life. If you just pick up that old curling weight one curl is ten times as better then a click of a computer mouse dont believe me try it. Interacting with people is a big part of our life its how we get , give orders and its a lot faster type of communication then sending a email. Without interacting with one another we can suffer from depression. Depression can make people sick for example, my father, when @CAPS5 was divorsed the depression effected his body and mind. so it become a fashion of using personal vehicle which create a lot of problem big one traffic problem..... now traffic problem is the biggest problem. I believe this was from lacks of communication and this happens everyday to everyone just open your eyes and relise what a computer can do to a man or woman. (@CAPS5 was remaried to bonnie and now carrys a scars on his belly). If the person want to become bowler then concentrate on running,action,stance and for batsmen need concentration on lag and bat coordination,eye and bat coordination,discover some shots which became key factor in batting. Just get outside and talk to your neibor see what they think. Nowadays the public transporte isn't hardly necessary for our life.However,a lot cities have a problem about traffic,cause of this trouble that citizen don't use public transporte such as autobus, taxi, or even metro.Consequently,gorvernment start to support and take care of the public transporte."	3.5
485	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"The diabetes is the increasing  of the glucosa in the blood, The have two types, first the Diabetes Type 1 that is predent in childrens, pacient needs insuline every day, also this diabetes is caused by the destruction of the insuline realized by the person´s immuny siste. In my case, if I could change one thing about our university, I like to make classes that professor and students can use english and korean freely. At first, I had called a travel agent but he said he couldn’t be able to book me a flight before two months, so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent. First, english could deter fluent expressions about thoughts. I advise any one dream to be one of the most famous teams that works on hisself a lot & and play football a lot to be profectional in this sport & show a lot of matches &followed by captain supervised on him This kind of limitation emerges when we are participating in class. Although professors can speak in english sufficiently for conveying informations, but there's substantial loss in content when professors convey their own thoughts and visions, which require sophisticated methods to be expressed. Then ,the notes will be prepared with metal plates .After that ,printing ,the notes will be printred in colour on  both sides with special ink and it will images sightly raised . Second, it is not convincing that using english in classes can improve student's overall language abilities. This reason is particularly related to my own experience. For several years, I've seen various kinds of videos in YouTube which are in english, but I'm not confident that I can use english freely. I believe that the second language acquisition being done by listening and reading has a critical point that cannot be surpassed without actual interactions. In conclusion, using only english in class can lower the quality of lecture, and the reason that classes in english can improve student's language ability is not that reasonable. In my opinion, the ultimate purpose of university is improving one's thoughts to be more complex and detailed, and using only english in class could make the exact opposite result. Constructing thoughts should be done before using foreign language."	3.5
486	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Nowadays, the number of smokers has been increased dramatically whereby even small kids also know how to smoke. If this situation continues without any remediation, then the consequences will be unpredictable. Many of us know that smoking is a bad practice, but even with all the information that stated the effects of smoking, why do some of them still need to smoke? One of the common reasons that lead a person to smoke is he or she wants to release stress. I will tell you a review of a thriller, the thriller is Hunger games it is about some capitals and people are choised and play on a game, you have to kill persons for they don't kill you, is a movie that have suspense because you want to know ho survey, in the movie someone love someone and protect each others, is very cute but on the 3 movies they are bad moments with the family, capitals, Friends, etc. However, there are still lot of others method which can be used to release stress such as listening to the music, having a conversation with friends and so on? Therefore, why do people still choose the foolish way in releasing stress since there are so many other alternatives ways? Every year, our government keeps on spending billions and billions of money in order to stop people from smoking such as organizing smoking campaigns whereby the purpose is to educate the youngsters to avoid smoking. Our government even restricted for no selling cigarette to all under 18 youngsters. I love to listen to British English, but it’s really hard to study, all because we are all learning American English in Taiwan, so when I have the opportunity to contact British English, it’s full of tone cadence, always feel particularly charming, and British culture exudes noble temperament, so British accent sounds like there is always an indescribable elegance qualities. No, the fact is we still can find out that there are still lots of under age smokers. It all started in the Parson Institute in the class of art history students of the race of Fine Arts in the class the teacher in charge, Jimena, commissioned a task to his students, saying: -To Begin with this course, I want to be sure they know the meaning of art, pro I want it translated into a sculpture or painting made by yourselves, without any specific technique, only your imagination, with it you explain to me what it is art. Actually, we have a lot of problem with traffic: lots of cars in the railway and it don't running; the number of cars in the street cause a dirty pollution;  crawded railways causes a later destination. I believe education plays its roles, but it should be started when the child is still small. As a result, the percentage for that child to become a smoker in the future will be lower. In addition, another important factor that may affect a child to become a smoker is the behavior from the parents such as parents who are smokers will increased the chance of the children in that particular family to become smokers too. The answer is simply; this museum has many types of momias.In 1810 have been a war for indepedent of Mexico many people were fight with other people; for example: Miguel Hidalgo is considerate: ""The father of indepedent"" and he was to fight with monarquia Spanish. Make the earth better and give yourself a better life; say ""No"" to cigarette and be a part to against smoking start from today."	3.5
487	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"No one can deny the fact that smoking is harmful to health, even the cigarette packaging says that. As lots of researches have shown time and again, quitting smoking contributes to the decrease of lung cancer incidence. They are called below: 1- chaharshanbeh soori 2- Norouz 3- sizdehbedar  chahrshanbeh soori:  It meaning Tuesday night of week and take place on last Tuesday night of the year .at this night people make a bonfire and jump over the fires and say to fire :I give you my sign of sickness(yellow color)and you give me your healthy sign (red color)and eat some special foods . Obviously, it is high time we took some measures to solve this problem, and the smoking ban does help a lot. He selected people to into in a chinese room, there was a computer in chinese language with diferente symbols, the american was a diferente behavior, they did not understand what was in the computer screen. During recent years, people have paid more and more attention to their physical conditions. On some public occasions, like restaurants, people are forced to inhale second-hand smoke. Non-smokers long exposed to second-hand smoke suffer even more harm than the smokers. Furthermore, for the smokers, if they know smoking is banned at restaurant, they may smoke later. I studied in Kuwait schools , after that I joined Damascus university , the faculty of human medicine , I graduated from it in 2008 with very good grade , then I got the Master's degree in laboratory medicine from the same university (Ministry of Higher Education ) in 2013 with Excellent grade . Over a span of time, they may be less addicted to the cigarette. Lastly, smoking ban also brings benefits to our society, contributes to a better social morality. I believe that the people in a future they will begin to travelling shared car more time and they use less the public transport as the train, the bus, underground, etc. As far as we can see, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country is a good policy. Only in this way can we finally make the smoking ban come true!"	3.5
488	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"If I can change one important thing about KAIST, I will develop around the university. Since 2000, Daejeon improved dramatically as well as KAIST. my English   language is weak , I like to improve it which complete my post graduate study,      The reason for choosing this specifically English language  in September  future I would like to get to know more information about   an English language course . I think there are three reasons. First of all, there are nothing to enjoy without alcohole. In Googdong and Auendong, only bar exist. It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs.In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us.In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable. Drinking alchole can make cancer for people. I want to turn to his hobbies, when he isn't working, he is riding on a bike, every evening he takes the bike and rides across some paths for more than forty kilometers by day, so he is very good rider and its quite strong to ride with him. If we develop around KAIST and make playground without alchole, then young student will drink less alchole and they can improve their grade and health. Second, In KAIST, traffic is not good. There are no train to going KAIST. So students will pay a lot to using taxies. It is big problem to students because students do not have many money. He selected people to into in a chinese room, there was a computer in chinese language with diferente symbols, the american was a diferente behavior, they did not understand what was in the computer screen. It can improve student's well being as well as KAIST's well being. Finally, If we can develop around KAIST, student can meet many kind of peoples. I think meet people and learning society skills is improtant as well as class. Lastly , workshops about conservation of environment to increase environmental awareness among people to encourage them to take care of their city , and how they can recycle some rubbish to beneficial objects to exploit it at home . So students can not meet non-KAIST people. This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. I think young people like college students should meet varity people from developing around KAIST. In conclusion, I think I will develop around KAIST because of the above reasons. Developing spend a lot of money, but It has more benefits than harms. Because college stundents shuold enjoy without alchole, spand less money using traffic, meet many people. To combat the distriction of enviornment,this is a serious problem throughout the world.Nowadays ,many trees and grasses are damaged in many countries,lots of building are constricated.And people should pay attention to this problem and try to slove it."	3.5
489	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people.

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"To the editor of the @ORGANIZATION2, I am writing to state my opinion as to whether computers benefit or harm society. I believe that computers are a great tool for several reason. First, computers are a learning resource, and a way people stay updated with the world around them. Also, computers keep us connected with friends and family more easily. Clearly, computers are more helpful to people than they are harmful. Life as we know it today would be greatly altered without the advances in computer technology that have been made over the past few decades. Today if I need to know something, whether it be for @ORGANIZATION1 or my own reason I can almost instantly look it up and get answers from many different sources. This helps people to be more educated and updated with the world around them. Dr. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 recently preformed a study on high @ORGANIZATION1 teenagers and concluded that, ""@CAPS1 with access to computers scored signficantly better on standard testing due to background information they have accquired while on line"". As well, we have to promote that the people get jobs close their accommodation or get the accommodation close to the jobs, because we have too much pollution and we could reward the companies that hire staff close to the place of job, maybe in a circle of 4 kilometres, as well we could reward the people that turn their accommodation for live near to the job or for going  there by a bicycle.

For example, when the earthquake devestated @LOCATION1, I first saw it on the news, but got very few details. I the looked it up on line and imediatly get the death toll, the aid that was being given, and ways I could help donate. Without computers, I would have known none of this. Another reason as to why computers are so helpful to society is that they are tools that help us to keep in touch with others. Transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible Without computers, I would need to call each person individualy, but with computers I can write one message and send it to everyone all at once. However, public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a new car and for the adventurer who want to have an exciting travel for then to see more action.Like watching outside or sight seeing,to mingle and meet different people.In addition to this I also admire the bullet train in japan which u consider fast and safe public vehicle Ive'd known. Also, things like @CAPS3 and face book help people to stay in touch with old and distant friends. Following your letter , I want to tell you about The apartment is very Beautiful not big or small medium-sized left inside two rooms, a bathroom and a dining hall and an external director categorize overlooking a beautiful view I am sure he will like it  to come and Tri condo b soon ,n the end, I would say that I miss you too much and I hope to see you soon. My town do much efforts to care of environment,they put many pins in the streets to keep it clean also they prevent private drivinig at many days to keep air clean ,they seed trees to absorb co2 and release o2 ,they build factories away from the house of population to prevent respiratory diseases which is a result of air pollution from factories,so not only my country it self but also the individuals follow a proper way to keep environment clean. At first and important change is about eating prepared food that isn't healthy usually,its reason probably woman's life stile that is going to big change in the way that they don't like staying at home and spend their time to making food ,now they prefer to buy prepared good. It easily allows people to stay educated, updated, and connected. It helps people stay aware of the world around them and educated about everything. It makes things that would other wise take lots of time very quick, giving people the chance to do other things such as playing outside. It keeps people socialy capable and active, and allows people to connect with others. Without a doubt, computers are a very good thing."	3.5

Therefore censoring books is wrong because it goes against freedom of speech. I do not believe books, or other media should be removed because while it @MONTH1 be offensive, if it is the truth about something then we need to read about it to prevent tragedies from happening again. A person who finds a topic offensive isn't forced to read about it. The story tell us the story of Monica(Scarlett Johansson) and her routine living in ""Cretacro"" an enormous mysterious island located in the Pacific Ocean,the problem starts when Monica fell in love with Martin. Many books that are threatened by censorship are books about historical facts, such as the holocaust. My studies in tecnologico de Monterrey are demanding and challenging because it has a very high educative score all worldwide, but also has to many good things, for example we have a lot of interchanges all around the world, when you have the opportunity to do an interchange you have to deal with the language and the culture with the other country, that means you have to be responsible for studying the basics things of that country, but all of this is worthwhile because when you are there you have so much fun. I screamed, my anger had dominated my mind i didnt had no longer control over my actions, i was afarid of what i had become and what i could do, but i could not control my self and the only thing i could think of was him suffering with a slow death and the satisaction i would feel when i finally had my revange, the best revange. my English   language is weak , I like to improve it which complete my post graduate study,      The reason for choosing this specifically English language  in September  future I would like to get to know more information about   an English language course . Just becaused we are ashamed of something dosen't mean we should sweep it under the carpet where it can lay hidden waiting to stike again like a hungry alligator. Instead books about prejudice events should be kept out to show an example of how we shouldn't act. While some books are censored because of shame, some are censored because a certain group of people @MONTH1 find it offensive. There is a much easier solution that censoring those books. The offended groups should just ignore the book. If it is offensive in the first place then no one should be forced to read it. The book shouldn't be forced in any other way like posters, and television broadcast. It should be kept in a certain section of a library so parties wishing to avoid it can. Finally, Taiwan still suffers economic slump, but we have so many businesses likes to innovate, market their product, customers likes to buy it. However, isn't keeping someone from saying something just as offensive? To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 is a big target for censorship, but it is about treating everyone fairly. However, public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a new car and for the adventurer who want to have an exciting travel for then to see more action.Like watching outside or sight seeing,to mingle and meet different people.In addition to this I also admire the bullet train in japan which u consider fast and safe public vehicle Ive'd known. Another big target for censorship in some countries is the @CAPS3. First, Basketball is team sport when it means i need to understand expression of  members  of team and keep contact them  for example  my roll is cutter but i need to do assister, blocker and guarding when i play. Censoring something is wrong. Not only could it cause sad events to repeat themselves, offended parties can just simply avoid the book. While some books offend people, censoring a book can be just as offensive to other parties. The simplest thing to do is to leave it up to the reader to decid if they should read it, or not."	3.5

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Lately, a technology buzz has hit all over the world. Where ever you look, be it at home, at school, at work, or on the streets, you see people texting, talking on phones, blogging, and other computer related things. This concerns some people. They believe that these generations are relying too much on computers and not spending enough time exercising outside or socializing. Suddenly we heard the sound of running footsteps.Then there was a cry and the footsteps stopped.Nervously,we walked back.Perhaps someone had been killed,or kidnapped in the street We were going to see what happened ,and we had something to see.There was one old granny who was beat up.We try to gave her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that.Than we were trying to find help ,but nobody was opening doors.On our luck I had a mobile phone ,but Michael was saying that we need to escape because we did not know are those bullies near the corner.My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I've done that. These experts are judging computers too harshly, for it's not like everyone is zoning out in front of a glass screen, sucked into the world beyond. @CAPS9, most of these ""computer geeks"" are using the computer for useful things, while they are also used for entertainment, computers also help society to reconnect with long-lost friends or even get directions to a well-know resuraunt. last year I saw a movie called ''side by side'' , and talked a little of life in old history  , and coincidence I was having this matter in school, then it helped me a lot. Computers are sometimes seen as a nusence. Parents complain about the many times they have to drag their sons and daughters from the screen for dinner or a soccer game that started @NUM1 minutes ago. One day Penny discovered it and it go to tell it to his queen, the queen at knowing that she get very confused but at the same time she get mad and she wanted revenge. Everyone goes on the computer. ""Even though my father complains that I'm on @CAPS1 too much,"" @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1, says. ""@CAPS2 forgets that @CAPS2 has one of his own."" I don’t like Narnia, but my favorite movie is probably 22 jump street, Lord of the rings, The tv-show: suits, The walking dead and maybe south park and family guy. About @PERCENT1 of adults confess that they too have fallen into the new fads such as @CAPS1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. So why do we need these things? What seems to make them so important to us? The answer is simple, it makes us feel connected. Then again, if you think about it, maybe not so simple. Reduce the fast food that make people obese and not healthy.It will be better if you gave drinks compared to the weather like whenever its winter we would like a hot drink and if it is summer we would like a chilled drink. I think it would be important that, not only in the family, but also in the school could be grow a new generaion sensible to ecological problems of the earth. @PERSON2, computer technician, informs. ""@CAPS6 all your friends are in something, wouldn't you want to as well?"" @CAPS7, as the famous saying, @CAPS8 your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?, flashes through your mind let me answer that for you - @CAPS9. Them they drink a cafe that give them many energy to construct faster the building, this café has a combination for the people can to live all the night. As you find friends from highschool or just friends from school, your glad that @CAPS7 you can talk to them face to face - or computer screen to computer screen - again. Last, but certainly not least, the computer is a great resource. You should knew about the prize for coming to the museum is very cheap ($15.00) for hour if you want to stay more time the prize increase in $10.00. This is how websites like @ORGANIZATION2 make billions from the words being typed into the search engine. The facts and places that arise from the computr are like gems waiting to be found. My favourit sport is football i love it so much when i was young i used to watch football and my favorite team is Barcelona i was play with my friends at the street and we was happy with that so much and after that we played at playground like really football i love Cristiano Ronaldo so much he is the best player at the world a few people telling me that messi is the best player but i feel angry when i hear that because that is not true so i looking forward to meet my best player one day its like a dream to me . Everyone uses it for different things and different hobbies. Whilesome for pure entertainment, others for information, and another for reconnection. My personal favorite finiding the true treasure of hidden bands, the fantastic ones, that @CAPS9 one even knows. And so, this is why I'm convinced the computer is a positive impact on the world."	3.5

"If someone is looking for an offensive book, they are going to find it, whether it's collecting dust on a library shelf or is brand new in a book store. The same goes for an offensive @CAPS1, magazine, or movie. Removing the offensive items from library shelves will only cause the people searching for these items to look elsewhere. Different people have different opinions on what is offensive and what is not offensive. In conclusin,the whole part of process is an unreversed schedule.It cosumemed the power which contained the humanity and machinic.Nevertheless,in my opinion the most precious of the revolution is the modern security measure through such a muti-developed society. my favourite sport is swimming , it makes me feeling comfortable and left me in a good mood , i go to swim twice a week , and my advice to anyone want to start to enjoy every moment of it i like volei because it was part of my life and of life of my mother, is my favorite sport, but i like over sports too, same i don't play volei because I'm bad, and my friends that know, don't like of  peoples bad of volei.I'm watching they playing, they're really very good, but when play over school, they're very bad Another reason libraries should not remove offensive items from their shelves is that, most likely, the entire book, magazine, movie, etc. is not offensive the whole way through. Even if a movie has one offensive scene in it, the rest of the movie could be a great story that many people would benefit from seeing. It is the same idea with a book or magazine. There @MONTH1 be a few offensive chapters or one or two offensive articles, but very rarely will you find a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive the whole way through. Of course, there are still offensive items that would be bad for younger kids to see even with the one or two offensive scenes, chapters, or article. There are easier solutions to this problem than having to remove the items from the shelves completely. One solution to this problem could be for libraries to put age limits on certain items, so that younger kids can't check out materials that are too innapropriate. But more importantly, this would be the job of the parents to monitor what their kids are reading, watching, or listening to. Removing offensive books, magazines, music, and movies from the shelves of libraries would just cause more problems and complaints. Consider both aspects that can be concluded that government should respect the human right and set up a new department which use for people who want to apply to complete the military service."	3.5

"Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an extremely usefull tool in this modern age. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to easily learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with other people. Therefore, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. football is a fameous sport you can whatch it on tv or yo can see it on direct.there ara a lot of  level categories, the most fameous categorie is the first. Although the public transport is slow but it also do not take a long time of people to reach their destination because public transport nowadays are developed more fast and enough. If the public transport will be by higher quality, faster and fewer rates, majority of citizens will be prefer: is more calm to relax and read a newpaper or a magazine during the way in a collective transport than an indiivdual one; moreover, the time spend up to go and came back will be reduced, because it promotes less car in the railway. And because they tend to want to type faster, it will help even more because the finger and eye will have to work in mission to type faster. No progress will happen without plan .Each one has a dream want to achieve it but first of all he need to put a plan and also cognitive one . People used to have to spend hours searching for a half decent book on a topic, and then find the specific information they need in the hundreds of pages. Now that information is only a few clicks away. Say you have had problems with your faucet, it keeps drippy but you dont want to pay for a plumber. You could easily step by step instructions on what to do using the computer, the possibilities are endless. I decided and went.It was strange because I never went to the sports.From the time I started going to karate.After one month my instructor told me that I will go to the competition.I was very worrying and nervous. It is more convinient than using a plane because you dont have to have something in your hands the whole time. You can walk away and then came back when you hear that you got a message. It is also very usefull for people such as buisnesmen because they can talk to multiple people at once while still being able to get other work done, @PERSON1, author of buisnes magazine tells us in an iterview that it is nearly imposible to run a succesfull buisnes without a computer. How people could possibly say that computers have a negative influence on society, I dont know. But I hope that you will publish this in the paper and show them that computers are necesary."	3.5
494	Lifestyles: Some people prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day’s work. Others prefer to get up later in the day and work until late at night. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.	"The Benefits of Getting Up Early in the Morning
 The time when people wake up is quite different. Some get up early in the morning, while others get up later in the day. It is a controversial topic that what time is better people should get up for happier lives. Many think that getting up early makes people healthier, while others think that there is no difference between getting up early or not, so it is a choice for them. In my opinion, people should try to get up early in the morning for several reasons. On the rest of the boring week, I was watching TV and suddenly my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet, so I decided to solve my Paris puzzles with my sister, which was less than a half solved for about one year but it had too much color in the sky so I didn't finished then a year ago. Everybody thinking like the public transport is not comfort for us, but environmentally the public transport is suitable to decrease the pollution and our energy sources also decrease. People get up easily when the sunlight is exposed to them because the brain recognizes it. While other strategies such as setting alarm for several times or asking family and friends for a morning call are stressful, using the sunglight is a natural and unstressful way to get up. Since the sun rises in the morning, it is a good choice to get up early in the morning for the unstressful start of the day. After 4 days all came with spectacular pictures, portraits of people, large sculptures, to a student, her name was Sandra, she arrived with a piece of crumpled paper, old in which only had a name written in a style different letter, only there reflected, exposing the moment everyone laughed at her for her work, but the teacher said: Art is complex, and seeing that everyone laughed with the work of his partner, can see that nobody understood the real meaning, since art is different for each person, each creates a different definition, so we must respect each of them understand that each person is a different world and everyone is art. Having a breakfast gives a brain the energy for starting the day's work, so people can spend their time actively. Moreover, it sends a signal to human's organs that he or she is awake; as a result, the organs activate their functions safely. After the breakfast, people can solve the negative effects of being hungry as well. Feeling hungry invokes people stress and worries, but they can feel relax and happiness by having a breakfast. Some argue that it is unevitable to wake up later in the day due to lots of works; however, waking up early in the morning enables working effectively. In order to reuse, I convert all thing reusable,for example,plastic bottle as a plant pot; glass bottle as a food container;I bring my reusable shopping bag and refuse to use a shopping plastic if a salemen offer me to bring. They do not have to work until late at night and can relax at night. The repetition of such days regularly makes the workers refresh and  work actively for the next days. It may be true that people should work until late at night due to serious problems or important meetings sometime; however, the habit of getting up early helps people recover their tiredness, and helps people keep their healthy lifestyles. Nowadays, public transport is used for many people in the cities, we can find different types of them, such as bus tube and train, but is there a future for it or not?, I am going to respond this question giving disadvantanges and advantages and  finally I give my personal opinion. It has significant benefits when people get up early in the morning. If people try to get up early in the morning, they can make a meaningful day."	3.5

Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Author Katherine Paterson once commented, ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. Other reason for my opinión is that almost all the people preffer use the visual sense and ear to other person more than write and listen for understand new things. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. Many people in society share Katherine's view, while some belive in strict library censorship. On the top of the steps is the inspectation by hands, that is to say, they should be separated into well-qualified ones,which are to be cut into bank notes,and delivered to the banks and the bad ones which can't be utilited are fired definitely at the last stage. Therefore, I support her sentiment. If materials are thought to be innnapropriate for children ,or others for that matter, then censorship needs to be set up in the home by the parents, not by a public institution. America was founded upon the need for freedom: freedom of speech, of religion, and press. If we start to change that or limit what press a library can or cannot have, we are destroying a nation's core values. Can we turn our back on what our forefathers knew we had the right to? Furthermore, if we start to take a few 'offensive' books off the shelf, where do we draw the line? Anybody can claim almost any book is 'offensive' in some way, shape, or form, that does not mean we should immeadiatly take it off the shelf of an important public institution. If you do not want to take my word for it, look back at histroy. What kind of civilization was @LOCATION1? Today, we have more item to recycle as long as we clean properly and put in a proper bin, which will be use it by specialized factory in another item. Hardly anyone would, and one of the things they controlled most was personal freedom. They started it off with the seemingly small act of censoring books. Fdi can play important role in it.It give competition to national companies .By virtue of which they  work properly mannerly and give better option to policy holders.people can always buy nominal premium we should aware them about the types of insurance as well as benefits of the insurancce. Later on they started to burn theese books, and punish people for having them in thier possesion. If we are to live in a country, where a man has the rights he should have, then we cannot censor library books. This seemingly harmless act could have much greater consequnces than foreseen. I grew up in a parent family.Sometimes I felt that I was alone and not loved.However,we were lucky enough to have a great mother who tried  all her best to keep my older brother，my older sister and I for completing our college studies .Of course my uncle ,young brother of my mother gave a big hand to go through the hard,so that made us often help each other in my family when the member who was in hard.Especially I was the youngest member in the family ,made much more troubles when I was young . The problem is, is that each families' limits and values are unique; We cannot just assume anything about families in general. I personally know a family that is very protective over what their children read, watch or listen to. On the other hand, I am aquainted with a family who allows their children more freedom to choose what they read. What one set of parents want to limit their child from reading @MONTH1 vary from another set of parents. Another example of why lives are gonna changed completely in 50 years is because also that connection between others cultures make People concern more about her own health, the expectations of life and the way they want to live it, because everyday will be easier to see how much are we hearting the earth so we will see faster the impacts that this brings to our life. Thank you  very much Joe for think in me for to be your witnees, I feel very proud that you think in me for to be your witnees and of course I accept and I will  be in Toronto for your wedding. One thousand people by eighteen and more are questions in my town about their way takes care of the environment.Investigation reveals the youngsters are more than ever power to  save the world from waste and pollution. In the end, it all boils down to freedom. Do we want to live in a counrty with freedom of press and the right to publicly access it. First,the bank notes are designed by consider,thinking from background colour,artwork,security issues.Then,the metal plates are preparated by skilled machinists.And then, the sheets are printed,operator should pay attention to the colour on both sides,special ink,and images slightly raised. We cannot clearly draw the line between 'offensive' and 'okay' because we are all different. Therefore we cannot bring our opinions down on the public instituion, but the home. It is not right to limit a whole society on what they have public access to because of one opinion."	3.5
496	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Although some people think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country; I hold a different opinion on this issue. First, everybody knows that smoking is not only bad for those who smoke, but also for those who do not smoke. This is very unfair for those who do not smoke. They do not like the smell of smoke, but they still have to bear it and their health conditions are affected. The only way to protect those who do not smoke is totally banned smoking to all the restaurants in the whole country. Second, more people's lives will be saved by doing so. My grandfather did not smoke at all, but he died of lung cancer. It was because that many of his friends smoke. for example, lunch time travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emission of carbon mono oxide which is effected to red blood cells and irritate to breathing system. Third, restaurant is a place of people to have meal instead of smoking. I have to start saying that I never imagine swimming like my favorite sport, because until my back´s injury, I practiced other sports, I most like extreme sports like downhill, skateboarding martial arts like Aikido, jiujitsu or ninjutsu, but for my injury I have to start swimming and now I love it. I am beleving that there is no future for the public transpot, using trains is mor convient and low expenses also to decrease the carpon gases which affecting the ozone, people should be aware about the effect of using the public transpotation on the econmics and enviroment, goverements shall encarge the people to use the other ways for transport, this subject shall be issuesd in all media to learn and encrage the people to use he wrigth way for transpot. Jump to the conclusion, since a lot of survey already pointed out that smoking is bad for people's health, we should have strict laws to restrict this bad thing, or more people would die of second-hand smoke."	3.5

Well if you are like the majority of the respectable, caring @CAPS3 in this country you probably answered yes to both of these questions; and you most likely also believe that the computer is a great tool to teach hand-eye coordination, as well as an awesome way to talk with other people online. i think that this is the guestion for every one, and the answer can't be one for all, cause, someone can use public transport, and economy by this not only money, but and the environment, but some people don't like to use p.t., cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple don't like to travell with another people. Three robots in specific hour make a show with instruments like a band.Foxy the pirate makes a show individually in her pirate cove, The children loves Foxy because plays with the kids making questions about the pirates and count a pirate story. Nothing that is what we could @CAPS1. Without the hand eye cooridination that computers and video games help you develop, you wouldn't even be able to go outside and enjoy a peaceful game of tennis, baseball, or even basketball all because without hand eye coordination you are clumbsy and your depth perception is off. If it weren't for hand-eye cordination you wouldn't even be able to pick things up because your hands wouldn't go where you eyes were looking. Even though the computer isn't the only way to learn hand eye coordination, it is still an important stragedy that takes no effort to perform. If you are a social butterfly and love to converse with other people then you simply must own a computer! Already public transport have been improvement and that makes comfortable to go on a trip,but I think that will be able to become good quality more and more,because so many people expectation. people ,espicially grnerator's owner, start using Canaopies, using very long pipes to get rid off as possible as they can from the polution. These computers helped to industrialize and grow our great superpower of a country. Can you imagine having to drive to people's houses just to talk to them. These machines get our messages and vices to people who can be all the way across the world in just a few seconds. They are a great inovation in technolegy. Imagine having a paper for college or an assignment at work due tommorrow, and you have messy handwriting. There is no way you will get it done in time and have it be legible; and worse is that you'll be fired or expelled if it's not done. But your savior has arrived! The computer improves peoples hand writing, speed, and research all at the click of a few buttons. Nowadays a person's worth seems to be judge  according to the social status and material possessions, that is mostly to happen in high class famiies, as they are foccus on achievements as power, political influences etc. What would happen to us with out this wonderful invention?

"Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. First of all,tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world.Alongside with its development,the ablity of travalling has easened to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another.The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism,as well as with the idea of globalisation,since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe that the books and other items should stay in the shelves of the library that censorship in libriaries is unnecessary.

Children, teens, and adults have their own right to choose whatever book they want to read, movie they want to watch , or music they want to listen to. If it is a child or a young teen then I believe that the parents should have a say in what their children read or watch. In my case I am not allowed to listen to offensive music or watch rated @CAPS2 movies but that shouldn't mean that it should be taken off the shelves of the library. Just because that is what my family believes to be right does not mean it is the only wat to live. when am in the court other side participants are fear take off my service ball and am very at my position to cover the entire court. They can make the choice by the way they have been raised or just because that is what they think is right or wrong. If they think that a book is offensive then they don't have to read it, they have the right to say no and put the book back on the self. If they think that the book is approriate then they can read it and there is no law stating that they have to share the book with anyone else. Some people guess the nuclear power has a great value to produce power instead of the fossil fuels such as : coals and oil which are Not renewable energy.Moreover, they think that controlling the pollution is possible. Every person is free to disagree with anything they want to disagree with. Here are some tips about the Egyptian people  they are so kind ,friendly,stressed but have a lot of  problems now days the level of poverty, standard of level ,the fixed cost  is increasing dramatically and the purchasing power is decreasing. Parents should make sure that their children are not reading inappropriate things or listening to offensive music or watching @NUM1 or rated @CAPS2 movies. Therefore, if you are comfortable with your children seeing and hearing offensive things then you don't have to worry about what is out there in the @CAPS1.The things that your children are watching, reading, listening to isn't a problem and if it becomes a problem in the parents eyes then they have the right to stop the children from reading the offensive books or watching the bad movies and listening to the music that the view as offensive. Every parent and family is different, as long as your child knows the rules and what you believe in then there is no need for censorship in libraries. In my family I am not allowed to listen to offensive music. Offensive music in my house is considered music with curse words in the lyrics. The words that my family considers offensive @MONTH1 be different then what other families consider offensive. I know that I don't want to and can't listen to those certain songs but that does not mean that I can't be friends or be around people that listen to that kind of music. Just because that is what my family believes in does not mean that it should be taken of the shelves of the library or any other place. Actually, we have a lot of problem with traffic: lots of cars in the railway and it don't running; the number of cars in the street cause a dirty pollution;  crawded railways causes a later destination. Every person has their own right and if they want to listen to that music then they should be able to. after two days poleas sow some boody in crime scene the poles man ask them what did you do hear ? If you took all the rated @CAPS2 movies off the shelves, then half the movies would be gone and that is not fair to the people who enjoy rated @CAPS2 movies. Invention of car has made people's lives easier.No more they have to solely depend on public transport.Though public transport are cheaper and one could get to know many companions ,increase network.But public transport has fixed schedule and on a rushing day not many can really enjoy their journey. I know what I stand for and I will do what I think is right and I won't listen to offenesive music or watch rated @CAPS2 movies. She told me not good at all, but my was good and she also added that you may got the chance and finally I got it.After three days later our result has been published and I got the chance but the girl didn't. Most people say that using public transport is better than using cars, and they say that its cheaper and better for the environment, about me I think that cars is easier and affordable way to transport between places, because cars is here any time and so near to your home instead of public transportation which you should take a walk to reach it in most countries, and also cars available all the time, you can go at 4 am and no one say anything, because its yours, but most public transportation is available only for the day hours and few hours at night, in emergency situation for example, what you will do, if you do not have your own car, your kid is sick, or you wife or your old parents, and in general the more we depend on ourselves the more our government able to help the poverty and homeless people out there, who really need more help and aid from the public community, we merely ask the government to improve streets and the traffic light systems, and more oil stations and parking in the streets, to be able to drive and move easy and safe and in a short time. It is every persons own right and they are capable on making decisions that they think are the right thing to do. Parents also have a say in what they want their children to watch, read, or listen to. They can montor what their children are reading, watching, or listening to and if they find it offensive they can stop their children. It is not necessary to take the items off the shelf. In my family, my parents find some types of music and movies offensive and I know when I go to the library or any other place that I won't get those items. I will get the music and movies I enjoy and find age appropriate. Just as in @PERSON2's quote everyone has the same rights and if we all take the items we think are offensive off the shelves, then there will be nothing left on the shelves. People's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years ,Equipment and tools have evolved since the beginning of human history.In recent decades,however, developments have been particularly groundbreaking,Man has been able to invent machines ,which they have been put to work automation is  a great help to mankind,because it significantly increases the standard of living and frees people form hard work.The result is much less work and a better life."	3.5
499	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am here to talk about my view on computers, about how they help people, and how many people say that kids and adults are spending to much time on them. MOTASSEM is a tall guy about 175 c.m and his Weight is 71 k.g and  has a wight skin  .He love going to the beach and he love swimming .He is a casual clothes wearing such Shirt and jeans which mostly  blue,Gray and Black .If you see him you notice how he is an elegant . FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY´S all begins in 1981 when freddy fazbear's pizza open, the establishment it's a pizza restaurant but this pizza restaurant in had robots, in 1981 there were four animatronics and their names are Chica , Foxy, Bonnie and Freddy. We can change  everything hurt us if we need if we have volition The reasons for  stress are more diverse perhaps because  we have an  exam period,  family proplems or because we think in negative way,  or we destroyed  ourselves  in long hours of working and canceld our needs  for enough comfortable,  and  lots of reasons to stress...   We must get  out of  the stress quickly before  lose ourself because it's very hurtful period, for example you can read a  book,  doing sport,  play music,  eating delicious food, remmeber  all the positive thing was took place with you,  talk about someone who trust for him,  take off every thing make you upset and make you life tiring,  go out and eat meal with your best joking friends,  and  there a lot of you have to do...   Remmeber the stress is not  lasting thing,  and you can avoid  it  But if you  are willing  to live in happy life. A computer is a tool that is a good feature for any home. It is great for people who own a small business, you can easily go online and update somthing yoou want changed in your store, such as designing colorful posters to put on the windows of your store to increase business and to catch peoples eye. You are also able to book flights weeks or even months before you even go to the airfort. This is good for those who are busy and travel a lot. You can go on a website called @ORGANIZATION2 where you can go anywhere vin the world and zoom in on a landmark such as the great @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2, or the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 in @LOCATION1. Computers can also improve your hand eye coordination when you type. Typing is a important skill to master, if you are a good typer you can do things much more efficient then you would on paper. Some can even memorize the key board and not have to even look down. all my class called me creep ugly geek but still little good only when a teacher want from them a research or the exams are next couple days but Michael trying to stop me doing that because they never become my friends and i was bigger to do this things ;    that day i just finish help younger student to understand his  math lesson  My friend Michael asked me to do the same to give her answer sheet for all final exams i was in bi shook why she  want that from me  any way i collect my courage told her that was wrong and become to do that in college better to start study  now and I'll help her to study the hard lessons (i was very sad to say no & she asked me that)she become very angry and told me i should help her because we she was my best Friend then i told her that why i told her NO and she told me i hate you Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. my favorite sport is swimming i swim 2 times per a week sometimes i go to the swimming pool in the same area which i work there and sometimes i go to the swimming pool of my cousin, i enjoy when i spend my time in the water and now even i am pregnant i am afraid when i swim with a group of people i keep telling them and screaming do not close with me ! These are just some of the things you can do with computer. On the other hand many say that people are spending to much time on computers, and getting outside for execise and not spending enough time with family. I do agree this is the case in some ways. IN my country peole do alot of mistake and have alot of of bad habits concerning their attitude towards the rubbish ,they are always throwing their old things and rubbish in public place ,the governement also cannot do their role towards their people and their bad behaviour Some kids became so addicted to computers that they might become unhealthy and become obease from sitting so much, this is something that should not happen. I hope you have learned a little bit about the good and the bad about computers, and how it is important not to be on the computer to much, but it can be an important feature if used correctly."	3.5
500	"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"it can never be regained even the strongest monarchs have been helpless to prevent time.So should be careful about the importance of time .I hope to not waste it and use it as the best use for giving opportunity for rising .Those who waste it ,will be behind and they will fail to make a mark in their life.The great men and successful guys became fame and rose by a suitable use for time .They guide and source of inspiration for a new generation. What is @CAPS13, exactly? Some might say, ""@CAPS8, that's obvious. @CAPS13's a sound, emitted from a person when they think something is funny!"" That's as good a response as any other, and certainly quite believable. But I believe laughter has a much deeper definition; a definition that can only be explained through a marginally-humorous, less-than-inspirational story about my experiences as a @CAPS9-@CAPS10-@CAPS11 basketball player. This year, as a high school sophomore, I decided to do something I'd never done before: go out for the basketball team. I was inspired by a longing to become more involved in the school district, and to be able to exercise throughout the rain-drenched winter months in which @CAPS13 took place. Having only picked up a basketball in order to steer clear of the ""sit-outs"" zone in middle school @LOCATION1, my performance at early practices was comparable to that of a high school dropout determining the orbit of the planets around the sun; and at least they get a calculator. Naturally the year I decided to give basketball a shot, the coaches informed us that seven unlucky individuals would be plucked from the team with joyous abandon. Through sheer force of determination, I improved enough in our first few weeks to be deemed ""better than dirt"" by the coaches; narrowly avoiding losing my spot on the team. In the months ahead, I would learn that my job wouldn't be making baskets and stealing balls... As astonishing as @CAPS13 was, my ability to imagine myself playing basketball far surpassed my actual skills on the court. I soon found that my place on the team wouldn't be aggressively running up and down the court fighting for control of an orange ball; I would be on the sidelines, cheeks firmly planted on the bench upon which my teammates would take breathers before going back into the action. They told her that her brother had a car accident first of all she shocked  Then she went quickly to the train station and she bought ticket to London when she was in the train she had other phone cell . As each game came and went, I could see the fighting spirit fizzling out of my peers' eyes; their morale was simply dropping, and no amount of my ball-playing abilities could change that. On the one hand, there are alot of famous player on volleyball who had Knee ligament injuries ,The most frequent mechanism of injury was landing from a jump in the attack zone.In addition to this,Injuries were more frequent during games than training. @CAPS13 was a home game, in our lower gym; we were down by about @NUM1 points against a team we had fared @CAPS8 against previously. Needless to say, players were becoming very frustrated. One of our star players, @PERSON2, was becoming so frustrated that our coaches decided to pull him out for a breather. He was raging, spitting profanities. He dropped himself on the bench with the elegance of an enraged walrus. This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Sitting beside @PERSON2, I could feel the anger radiating off of him. I strongly believe that grammar is not the most important element to speak English, if you know grammar you only know certain rules to write, but I think that speaking is most important than writing, because when you go to anyplace in the world, you have to be prepared to talk and understand whatever they say to you; in this part you may notice that if you don't know vocabulary, you wouldn't unsderstand anything; but here is another topic, whether you understand or not, you have to notice the way that people talk to you, and try to realize what the person is trying to say. I noticed that while @NUM2's fast legs and swift hands made him a great ball-player, his voice -- a good octave above his teammates' -- was much more @CAPS8 suited for covering @ORGANIZATION1 songs than calling out plays. my favourite sport is swimming , it makes me feeling comfortable and left me in a good mood , i go to swim twice a week , and my advice to anyone want to start to enjoy every moment of it He looked at me for a moment, a mixture of anguish and ""don't-talk-to-me-or-I-will-murder-@CAPS12"" on his face before bursting out laughing. Clapping me on the back, he said with a smile: ""@CAPS12 always know @CAPS4 to make us laugh, @PERSON1"". This afirmation: travelling by car is so much more convenient say everything, for example if we think a lot of time we spent on wait bus to arrive our destiny, the traffic is a lot of things that everyone prefer  buy car it more practical and fast. I was able to use @CAPS7 to diffuse tense situations, and allow emotions to flow freely in a more positive manner. We lost the game. In fact, we lost all but one game the entire season; and so I made @CAPS13 my personal duty to keep the entire team in good spirits even in the worst of times. As the weeks went by, I started to feel more and more an integral part of the team; making teammates laugh kept their minds clear of anger and frustration, and allowed them to play to the best of their abilities. And so @CAPS13 was. Yesterday ,I had a wonderful day  .In the morning I went to a Galician basketball training with a coach of Spanish selection ,when  finished went to my parents to a hotel to eat and stay with some friends , after the food meet with  friend´s of my parents and went to a theme park and we rode to a rollers coaster, it was very exciting and we ate a chocolate ice cream, it was delicious .At night we went to a match  of Spanish basketball league, Obradoiro versus Real Madrid and that match won the team of Real Madrid and then I went home to sleep. Me? I made people laugh. I gave my peers, my friends, the ability to see light in even the most dire of situations. I didn't receive an award, a recognition of athletic ability. Instead I found the satisfaction of making people smile, of watching the enraged despair on their faces disappear -- replaced with optimism and hope. he took the money the second day , he finished the registration and started in writing the story after long time spending in writing and did good job he went to give his story to the international student magazine office ,he found out there are a notice on the door say that the competition has canceled, he came back vey sad and told me what happened .Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake . So, @CAPS12 tell me: Is laughter simply noise that a person makes when something is funny, or is @CAPS13 something more? Dear Jo, As you know, my grandmother actually lives in France with my cousint Jonh, unfortunately he has to make three months course outside of the country, Jonh will leave France next weekend, but instead it is not possible, I have to go and look after her because none of my family cant waist three months over there."	3.5
501	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"The Importance of Curriculum to Develop Expertise in College. Personally I believe that those who are not participate any activity the teachers has them to encourage .Then only they also know how talented they are.Every student should attend and show their talent.After some ages we can not attend any this type of activity because we all are become old .So let do and enjoy your young age be happier. Their choice of subject is based on the requirements of each college. Some colleges require taking multiple subjects on a variety of topics; on the other hand, some colleges require learning professional knowledge on a single subject. Controversy continues over which of the two is desirable, and in my opinion, it is better to learn a specific subject professionally. It is based on two reasons; high academic efficiency and can be an expert on the subject. First of all, learning a subject professionally can increase academic achievement and efficiency. If college students continue to study a specific subject consistently, they can understand the overall flow through the subject, thereby enhancing their understanding of the subject. Some people say that basket it's only for tall guys but it isn't true, in the A league in Italy we have different players not very tall like 1 meter and 60 , so if you love this game you can play it no matter what find only a ball and a hoop and play it. In addition, interest and efficiency increase as they study their favorite subjects; therefore, students' satisfaction with their studies increases. I'll tell you a story happened  at school   as any normal pouring day  when you  teenager in school never ever end, but a one day was the best day from any  other pouring normal day because i learn how  live as powerful smart girl who used to let the other us her because she want to feel needed from my friends but i did not have many friends in school except  ""Michael"". The reason why students go to college is to become experts in a specific field and get a job in that field; therefore, colleges need to organize curricula so that students can become experts on a specific subject. If students learn a subject deeply, that is, become experts, they can perform better than others by utilizing what they have learned in college even after they have a job in the future. It can improve students' future lives as well as their present lives. In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life, but majority of ones is totally utopic. However, when students learn various fields, their depth is naturally licked; therefore, they graduate from college without actually learning important things and learning only basic contents. Far from increasing occupational diversity, it can lead to a lack of ability to find a job. In conclusion, colleges should require students to learn specific subjects professionally. That way, not only can students' academic achievement and efficiency be improved, but they can also become experts in the field. If students learn a specific subject professionally, they will be able to get the job they want more easily and the happiness of their future lives will increase."	3.5

Michael went into the teacher office,but he found that his teacher isn't here,maybe teacher went to the bathroom,suddenly,the door is opened by teacher,a teacher who wore bikini came into sight,this incident came as quite a surprise to Michael,she flirted with Michael,Michael felt excited but run out of the office,but he had regret for his action,Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. Your @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 would watch movies that you couldn't watch because they would say you aren't old enough. They enjoy watching more mature movies because it is more interesting to them than cartoon shows or movies. The mature content in movies, books, and more should be kept in libraries because mature audiences enjoy watching and listening to them. If they are taken out of libraries, this mature audience has nothing to watch or read in the library. They do not want to be reading children's books all the time. Also, most children have already observed or heard this offensive content in these books and movies. Most of the parents in the @LOCATION1 have used offensive language infront of their child without even realizing it. The kid then starts using these words because they think they are cool if @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 use them. Secondly, studying in university, I have to live far from house which make me be homesick, sad, and worried I have to live in dormitory with many strange friends, they ‘re very noisy and I have to share my room with my roommates. He seems different, she never imagined that Jason can be like that, she fantasy with someone, brave and strong, and she never foresees something like this, but she feel something for him, maybe she is in love with this guy . I think one of my favorites sports of all is the atletism I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself, you have to be every day better than you where yesterday, it force you to improve every time, also is an exercise that help all your body, especially the legs because it gives them great strength, but also your hands because they have to be in a constant movement, and all the body in general because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and help you to have coordination. Many movies and books that contain offensive language and graphic content are very good and educational videos. For example, '@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5' was a great movie describing the search for one man in the middle of @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1. These wars actually occured and movies like this give a great amount of detail on what actually went on during these wars. If you want kids to know about the history of our country, they need to know what actually happened. There is no point in trying to hide the truth. Overall, most kids in the @LOCATION1 have heard offensive language or graphic content. Whether it was from a parent or even their best friend, they have heard it. I think my town really take care of the environment,because there are a lot of parkｓ in this town and these are very clean.However　some people are not care of environment　that mean some people throw garbage away in the park.I think almost everyone loves parks because a lot of people go to the park and having　lunch,picnic,excersise,nap etc.I think after eat something at the park then clean themselves is good.

"We have Eather first than people thanour house.Eather is our home,we all have to protect it.But now people are distroy it.Just for mony for more house but if we destroy it we will all die our money will gone our house will gone we will have nothing.Beside some people destroy farland to build houses but if one day there is no farmland than what should we eat?Nothing at that time we can eat nothing!So what should we do? Censorship prevents knowledge from being obtained, spreading ignorance and intollerance. Libraries and schools are meant to be places that encourage free thinking, discovery, and learning. Censorship stops these things from occuring. If people are prevented from reading what they want, then many will not read, period. Not all children and teens are drawn to reading. But, on the other hand, because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable; cars are so many; very noisy, unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth. Because @CAPS11 or she finds it offensive? Because @CAPS11 or she does not agree with the views expressed? Neither are legitimate reasons for censorship. Most justifications for censorship would not stand the test of time. A great number of books challenged in the past are today considered classics and/or important works, such as To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1, The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @PERSON3. To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 were censored because of the racist language. @CAPS12 language helps to set the time period in the novels. Also, To @CAPS1 a @CAPS9 is about a lawyer who defends a wrongly accused black man in @LOCATION1. The main antagonist is an ignorant, rascist man. The book itself is not racist, only the villian of the story. Censorship for such reasons is different than not allowing a young child to watch something violent. Preventing a child from seeing a rated @CAPS10 movie or reading a letter to @ORGANIZATION3 is a separate issue from censorship. I define censorship as preventing someone from seeing or reading something due to personal views rather than for the good of the sheltered person. Keep children sheltered when they are young, if one must, but as they grow older and mature, it is essential that they are allowed to mature in their reading, as well. If someone lives their life reading only the books others choose for him or her and seeing only the movies and shows chosen for him or her, then @CAPS11 or she will not be his or her own person. the citizens in the town must participate in this , the citizen will take the responsibility for specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish into correct place and clean tree and plant more of it . They will not have their own views, and will be largely ignorant to the world around them. People's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years ,Equipment and tools have evolved since the beginning of human history.In recent decades,however, developments have been particularly groundbreaking,Man has been able to invent machines ,which they have been put to work automation is  a great help to mankind,because it significantly increases the standard of living and frees people form hard work.The result is much less work and a better life. the most family member I love and think she is the best friend of mine , my sister , she is elder me about 12 years , I can tell her any thing about my life , my self , my feelings ,hhh also i think if i felt in love she would be the first to know that . Censorship can mold people, not for the better. Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real. These people can have views and values of their own, formed by, among other factors, influential books they have read throughout their life. Good day, My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport, Volleyball one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to practise  this sport 3 times a week since 1980,  the reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as follows : 1- make me fit and healthy  2- classy game no friction between players  3- it exercise all muscles of your body Regarding the above I advice all rookies to start practise this sport and they will get many benefits. Censorship takes away all of those wonderful qualities from people. Anyone is capable of possessing them. Censorship cannot be seen as the norm. Libraries and schools should allow children and teenagers to learn and grow.That is the purpose of the institution of education. Therfore, censorship should not even be considered. In case of transportation technology, in this twenty first century we have various option like Plan that can fly with the cloud, train that fast and big enough that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time."	3.5
504	What are the advantages of watching online video lectures versus viewing live lectures in a traditional classroom? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"As you know, all lectures are online videos in Intermediate English Reading & Writing class. most are live lectures but some are uploaded videos. I really love this class. It really helpful for me to writing English. That was me, I never liked studying, I never found myself in those subjects, but it wasn't the big deal to me, I hated is being seen as unsuccessful or a loser, as I wasn't that, I knew that I'm clever enough to study all these subjects and do well in exams so I can get high marks but they're all didn't get that, they judged me for my marks but marks don't form brains or thoughts, marks isn't the only way that makes you great now and then in the future. This semester is my first online semesyer because I was went military but I fell in love to online class. First, watching online video lectures save times. When I was freshman of KAIST, I had English Speaking class by Horgan professor(spelling confused..) at 9 am. Ariving at right time to N9 is so hard to me. I had to wake up until 8:30 am but when I drunk alcohol I waked up 9:00 or sometimes sleep to 12 am. To take live lectures, student have to use times. As we are fully depending on the indivitual generators ,that are causing multiple problems in he weather dueto it's smoke, the oil and gass left behind , in addition to sound offcourse that are themain source for the 18 countinous hours noise. We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben, which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye.To got to the Big Ben we took the underground, but to get to the London Eye a red bus.After 3 days we went home.I forgot to tell you something about homeless people.A lot of people are homeless, which is sad, but maybe we can change it. More surprisingly, if course is not a live lecture, student only watch the uploaded videos until remained times. On the top of the steps is the inspectation by hands, that is to say, they should be separated into well-qualified ones,which are to be cut into bank notes,and delivered to the banks and the bad ones which can't be utilited are fired definitely at the last stage. Second, online class give high quaility lectures rather than offline class. my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long. Traditional classroom has limited seat and desk so some people can’t take the class. Also, all students looks same lecture, same presentation on online class. for example,using wind Energy or Solar Energy for electricity generation we will be used less fuel what is affected in emissions. Obviously, the professor could check the student reactions for his lecture. Lastly, student review the class by uploaded video lectures and ppt. This is due to Lima in the beginning  has not had a pant to desing its public road s and highways, and it only has been improvising to build their way without any criteria to transport its population. When I was talk with my friends, they said they studied online class more than offline class. Reason is they have more times and had videos to study beacause most class take online video lecture. Nowadays, we had no other choice to take class. we had to take online video lectures to avoid covid - 19 spreading. Online class is friendly to student. It has great advantages to student. Most illiterate people choose their proficiency as  public  transportations like ,bus service, cab service, auto service....etc, in order to full fill their basic needs.People with more  unemployment may also lead to a crime rate ."	3.5
505	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"Nowadays, college students are allowed to take part time jobs while studying. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately.He had to buy a present for his girlfriend´s birthday but it was Sunday and all stores were closed so he had to found a solution.A few hours,he was walking by a garden,and suddenly,he saw the most beautiful flowers that he has ever seen,so he picked them up.However,flowers weren´t enough so he decided to think in anything else.Several hours later,he found an open sweet shop and he bought some bonbons for her.Finally,he had found the present and before the end of the day he ran quickly to his girlfriend's house.If you don't want to pass this situation,you must always do things with time. Personally I think that these part time jobs are important to college students. As we can see, not everyone in this world is rich. The same applied to college students. Some of them can not their education fees and may need to have additional income source. One of those sources is by doing part time jobs. Part time jobs allow the college students to earn money without neglecting their studies. It is an effective solution for students with monetary problems Besides money, part time jobs also give work experience. When we are entering the world, experiences are a good asset for us. In other way, I never be a witness , what I have to do?, tell me what cain of suit have the witnees have to wear, If I have to buyany colour of tie, the flower.... really I'm very exciting with your wedding. For example: waiter. In some restaurant, we can see many part timer works as waiter. Those waiters can get communication experiences while they serve the customer. I played so good that everyone gave me congratulations but thats not all one of the best team of the world wanted too take me. Adolescent has always been the hardest part throughout anybody's whole life.. turning out in a fleeting glimpse into an adult, perceiving the other side of life,how tough and complicated it is, trying to deal with its different circumstances.. at this point you merely have a brief look at your whole life, many questions spinning in your head, accusing yourself of being a lost cause, wishing if you could turn the clock back,,but it's all no good.. then you find yourself standing ahead clouds of reality, which sucks.. life is stages, this stage of your life is timeless, no way out.. at some point you wish if it was all illusio, you need a time machine makes it possible to go back in time when you could see the purity of life.. However..here you are completely different made of life lessons, preferring to make a stiff upper lip..cowering in your own reality. Part timer must manage their time so their work schedules are not crashes with their college schedule. Also they must know when to take a break for learning and doing projects. This way they can learn how to manage their time effectively. The first two step is to design with background color artwork and security issues and prepare metal plates with skilled machinists.Then there are some requirments for printing sheets:color on both sides, special ink and images slightly raised.The most essential and key process is manual inspections for printed sheets with three categories: good quality sheets, patially damaged sheets and bad sheets. It can give additional income, experiences and building our skills. So I think it is important to have part time jobs."	3.5

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear editor: More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that that benefits society. The diabetes is the increasing  of the glucosa in the blood, The have two types, first the Diabetes Type 1 that is predent in childrens, pacient needs insuline every day, also this diabetes is caused by the destruction of the insuline realized by the person´s immuny siste. In my opinion computers are desperately in need because of the following: the computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places, people, and weather, they allow people to talk online with others, and many jobs use computers. Do you want a more economically advanced state? First of all the computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places, people, and the weather. I will tell you a review of a thriller, the thriller is Hunger games it is about some capitals and people are choised and play on a game, you have to kill persons for they don't kill you, is a movie that have suspense because you want to know ho survey, in the movie someone love someone and protect each others, is very cute but on the 3 movies they are bad moments with the family, capitals, Friends, etc. Every day in the morning before school @PERSON1 checks on the weather, on his computer to make sure it is safe to go school. However, one day forgot to check the weather on his computer and took his kids to school. Technology advance way to fast and it is really difficult guessing what kind of stuff or artefacts will be fifty years from now, but we can guess some ideas like flying cars, smartphones with the size of a small paper, laptops really thin like quarter of inch, clothes that clean itself or change the color and shape, healthier food, smarter electrodomestics. Sadly @PERSON1 and his daughters got in a car accident and two of girls broke a few bones. In our earth, Hunderds of millions prople living in here.Except us, There are also a large number of wildlife. Next, the computer allows you to talk online with other people. Dr. @DR1 from @CAPS1 states says that, ""chating online with others (@CAPS2) is the best way to stay in touch with others from your old school, camp and many other places."" I highly agree because adults can stay in touch with freinds from middle school. Also @PERCENT1 of students say that they usually go online to study or get the pages for homework. !hhhh sometimes is funny but my husband he takes cars of me he doesn't allow to anyone to be much closer with me, my mother in law she likes swimming too  last night we went to the swimming pool it was a little bit cold but we liked so we went to the pool and srated to swimming i know how to swim very well but she doesn't she has to have a support otherwise she cant. Some parents say that that is a way to study and a waste of time. However teachers say that ever since @CAPS2 was invented the students grades were skyrocketing. Finally most jobs today use computers. For example my dad works for @ORGANIZATION1 and the computer helps him communicate with clients all over the world. Also the chat can translate the language, thus it makes it much easier than talking on the phone. Also the teachers use computers to put grades from students in. This makes the teachers job much easier because it averages all of the grades. The computer revolutionise the jobs of people. In conclusion the computer has a positive effect on people because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places, people, and weather, allows people to talk online with other people, and many jobs use computers. I urge you to support me by writing a positive article on computer and how the help the society. We separated paper from glass and also to plastic.The garbage picks up paper once a week,plastic two times at month and undiferretiated three times a week to all people who live in my country.My district makes clean my village and it usually tries to make attractive with new social initiatives for the community."	3.5
507	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"By the pandemic of the COVID-19 virus, lots of colleagues are using online lectures rather than face-to-face classes. However, some benefits exist in online lectures. They have many different points with the traditional class. it's for this reason that I think the public transport is a great benefit for the society, and a good way for move us of the one place at other,  I suggest that  the government  has to give more means for the purpose of improving the public transport. They don’t have to move to the class. Moreover, they take the exams on the internet too. As Automotive Industries are huge in market, most of the  house holders  prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time . Today personal vehicle become pride of the life , mean if a person is on there personal vehicle they are look as higher status in the society . Students can replay the recorded video of the lecture, and they can watch it again when they couldn’t understand at once. Moreover, they can discuss together through online lectures. If students have the questions, they can send an e-mail to each other, and ask to the professors with chatting. However, the face-to-face class can’t. Sometimes the employers do strike and we clients do not known in time as a result we can not get on time to work,that is one of the disadvantages of using public transport. This is why online lectures can help study of students. Second, they can save time and money. According to the interview with the Korean Government, students usually spend their money on transportation fees over 100,000wons every month. Moreover, some students may cost dormitory fees. On the other hand, online lectures don’t require them to students. They may watch the video in their home. Fifty minutes passed ,when my body no longer was sore.I decided to walk to the end.Constantly,I just walked like without terminal contest.While I strugged to walk.Finally,I saw a light to appeare my eyes and I woke up. Almost students who live in Gyeonggi-do, they usually waste their time by moving. Finally, the fairness of the tests and assignments are strengthened. According to the development of monitoring technology, the fairness of the exams is strengthened. Students have to show their whole desk and computer before they take an exam. Moreover, the exams are recorded. Furthermore, the deadlines of assignments became fairness too. Before the online lectures start, some TA didn’t keep the deadlines of assignments. I think one of my favorites sports of all is the atletism I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself, you have to be every day better than you where yesterday, it force you to improve every time, also is an exercise that help all your body, especially the legs because it gives them great strength, but also your hands because they have to be in a constant movement, and all the body in general because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and help you to have coordination. In conclusion, many advantages and benefits exist when we study in online lectures. First of all,tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world.Alongside with its development,the ablity of travalling has easened to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another.The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism,as well as with the idea of globalisation,since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen. The reinforcement of fairness, saving money, and recorded lectures will be good examples."	3.5

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have reason to believe that computers and other similar modern technologie is breaking up the world we once were. Things such as computers are a main cause of @CAPS3 lacking exercise, interaction with family and friends, and is also a possible danger to ones mental health. The leading cause of obecity and an outrageous amount of overweight people in @LOCATION1, is the fact that people spend way to much time on computers, and not excersizing. I have recently found out that in the @DATE1's the average familly had one computer (sometimes none). The mas was armed try to steal the backpack.But he not be fixed that the man was a camera in his head and hi action was filmed. This major involves all, always we have to consider the all possibilities to resolve  homework , you have to know the most possible information for can resolve it. Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe, in fact there is some important tournament where participate all important Europe team,They are called ""Champions League"" and ""Europa League"".football is a team sport in fact in this sport participate everyboby without exclude nobody. I think in the future don't exist public transport because we will drive their car.When you drive your own transport ,a car for example, you going to from a specificlly place but in a bus you go to the bus stop and no to your house or school, work... It is better from the people be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person. Studies have shown that nowadays @NUM3 of @NUM1 marages ends in a divorce, where as in @DATE2, it was @NUM3 of @NUM6. Advances in technologie have astoundingly increased since then, and people are on the computer/phones/other @CAPS4 which is separating families everywhere. When impubesent children are trying to grow and expand their minds, all they are doing is sitting on the computer, and not getting the brain nutrition they need. The students in schools today are the future leaders of the world. Now the parents should be thinking, if they want their children to do well, or exeed their expectation in life, then they should not be sitting on the computer all day filling their-heads with nonesence. Now, computers do have the abillity to be educationally usefull, but do children use them that way? firstly, that private transport provide a comfortable mean to travelling from one place to another without sharing stranger people a way and by using this kind of transport also comfortable in free with choosing time of a trip. I hope you can agree on the fact that computers are causing more bad than good in familes all around the world. People are not getting the amount of exercise they need, aren't interacting with family enough, and these computers can become harmfull to the mental health of future generations. If famillies can minimize the amounts of computer-drawn activities, then I think parents all over the world can modify themselves about their childrens health."	3.5

"Computers are becoming a household item in the @LOCATION1 and around the world. Looking for any sport make you feel good and your brain be always refresh so that you  can begin your day with any sport to making fresh and after that you can make any job with refreshment mind. In my opinion, computers are a @CAPS9 thing for our everyday lives. The internet allows us to communicate with friends, family, and more people around the globe! Its various programs help keep files and other things of that nature organized and updated. Finally, computers are a @CAPS9 resource when researching for projects, reports, homework, or anything else that requires information to complete. Lastly , workshops about conservation of environment to increase environmental awareness among people to encourage them to take care of their city , and how they can recycle some rubbish to beneficial objects to exploit it at home . Often the evolution is return of origins however I hope that the man in the next years will be to don't forget the past. first we uses Internet to discover the world's news, from Internet we can check and read world's most famous newspaper such as new York times, the sun and also electronic newspaper.Internet also can be used to learn and to educate yourself, internet allow us to read books, magazines and short stories.Internet is the most effective way to start a business and to look for a job, many people uses Internet to work , and they earning money every month.Internet is a way to make new friends all over the world through social websites such as Facebook,twitter, and you tube.As a conclusion internet is making things better and easier, life now is always connected to the Internet. IM's, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, use one of these fast and cheap ways. They allow you to send a message and receive a message on any day, at anytime, in any place with little of no hassle involved. Another way is to use websites like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, which allow you to update your ""status"" on your wall so everyone on your friends list can see or comment on. The final and last way is by using a webcam, which enables you to see the person on the other end of the ""call"" and you can also hear their voices. This is the best way, in my opinion, because instead of sending text and pictures they can explain everything in their own way with no limit on how much they can say. public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it is kind of becoming cheaper and also more safe but some  people prefer cars to extent do we agree with and what is our reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay  before about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was not even good facility to move from place to other and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans at the beginning the faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve it by the end nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and planes .some people prefer cars because the do like crowded places or because the find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places  to summaries it is different from some oneis opinion to another i predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end cars will disappear and will will no longer be used Computers help organize it with their many applications and programs like @ORGANIZATION1 apps, @CAPS5, and document folders. @ORGANIZATION1 is a chain of apps for everything from writing documents to making spreadsheets to making presentations and even to making fliers for special events. These apps are the basic to starting up a business or promoting an invention. @CAPS5 mainly centers on keeping information stored an organized in files however you wish and is @CAPS9 for quick access to them. My parents and other adults I know always say ""organization is the key to success"", so @CAPS5 definetly helps. The final and most basic way that computers help for organization are document folders. it's for this reason that I think the public transport is a great benefit for the society, and a good way for move us of the one place at other,  I suggest that  the government  has to give more means for the purpose of improving the public transport. Them they drink a cafe that give them many energy to construct faster the building, this café has a combination for the people can to live all the night. Most importantly, computers come in handy when researching for projects or something else that requires lots of up-to-date information. Books will take a few days and you only have @NUM1 days to research, create, and organize your project and data. What are you gonna do now? You could hand it in late, but then you'll yet in trouble. and we must lern children that clean is necessary for their health and on their school they should throw rubbish on Waste basket and who throw it on the ground Will be punished . If you have a question about the @CAPS7 @CAPS8, use @LOCATION2. Micheal was afraid he was waiting for sara to get out he went to the shore to look if she went from the other side but he found no footprints.his mother called him he went home and still thinking about sarah.it was night and ge was afraid ti get there again.he went to sleep .michael closed the door and knew at this moment he had made a mistake. In conclusion, I would like to state that computers aren't a good thing for society, they are a @CAPS9 thing for civilization! From communicating with friends and family around the world to organizing our everyday lives and helping us research important topics, the internet and computers are a @CAPS9 way to help out our lives in my opinion. Wouldn't you agree with me?"	3.5

"?XD)Cherry blossom is very beautiful but there are so many people.When we went to Sun Moon Lake by cable car,wind is so strong!I felt a little nervous though the scenery amazing.All in all,I stil have a memorable vacation. Since more and more people have been using computers, the technology gets higher and people can acess much more things. Computers are good because they are convinent, and provide entertainment. We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben, which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye.To got to the Big Ben we took the underground, but to get to the London Eye a red bus.After 3 days we went home.I forgot to tell you something about homeless people.A lot of people are homeless, which is sad, but maybe we can change it. To find out these answers, all you have to do is look them up on the computer! The computer is so convient, that whenever you have a question about anything, you can use the computer! Take my cousing courthey, for example, everyday, her teacher asigns definitions for homework. So, she just looks up the definitions on the computer instead of taking the time to find them in the dictionary. However, @PERSON4 isn't the only person who thinks the computer is convinent. When surveyed, @PERCENT1 of people voted that when they have a question about something the computer is the most convinent item to use. Professor @PERSON2, from @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""@CAPS1, since more people are learning how to use the computer, it is becoming more convinent to everyone."" In conclusion, many people rely on the computer for information, and you wouldn't want to take that away from them, would you? Secondly,tourism,especially in developed countries,has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view.There are countries,such as Greece or Bulgaria,in which the econmoy relies merely on tourism.If tourism influences the econmy,it thereby influnces the environment,and if it influences the environment it influences the transport.How?people become more careful at their historcal sites,this way preserving them;Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale:At a small scale,in cities, in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently.At a large scale,people can now travel in almost any possible way:on land,on sea or air.Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations. I have learned to  get control of myself when someone teaes me , and to be alert as well .Also ,it helps to look always slim and put me away from the ghost of obesity as well .People who want to start playing karate have to be patient . The computer is a great source of entertainment. Whether its listening to music, playing games, or talking with friends, you will always have fun on the computer. For example, my neighbor, @PERSON3, comes home after school by herself. She is usually extremely bored, so, she goes on the computer and plays games, and talk with friends. I'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant its name is ""Lemon"" I go there every week it has different food from any restaurants I'd like chicken crispy with garlic sauce It's Excellent choice for me and My favorite appitizer is susage and in order that desert I'd rather ""Vadge"" cake with chocolate sauce I feel I;m at ease when I go there I enjoy  classical music over having a lunch about the service It's very good and all staff are respectable I can't imagine one week without going there that drives me nuts I advise any one to go there and enjoy  a time there , also this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really It's  excellent This strikingly thing for anyone  despite all of these advantages prices are not expensive . But, @PERSON3 is not the only one who talks to relatives on the internet. When surveyed, @PERCENT2 of people agreed that they talk to relatives from other places on the computer. Dr. @PERSON1, from @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""The computer is the main source of entertainment for most teens and adults."" @CAPS2, you wouldn't want to take away our main source of enteratinment, would you? I have played this sport for twelve years ago this sport has taught me to respect the other not assault to him.there is the only reason that makes me choose this sport is I don't want to be weak I wouldn't like to be nothing in this country that has a rule Strong dominated the weak.when I put my feet in the gym i forget everything shcool,home...therefore I enjoy it.I can't imagine my life without taekwondo it is my blood,my soul.taekwondo it is not a violent sport as many people say but what you have to know is what in the brain and the heart of players.I just get the 1st degree international black belt and I would like to tell to anyone he just starting this sport use your abilities and skills for the right things. But, in conclusion, computers have positively affected all people with their amazing convinence, and great sources of entertainment."	3.5
511	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"I just finish my lunch time, and before prepare everything to go to work I was thinking of you and I wanted to give you a small surprise with this fantastic photos, I hope you like it. Norouz:  It meaning new day of the new year and  takes place on 21 March (first day of spring )this day very important for us because we cleaning our house ,buying new clothes just for new year .The major things in Norouz day is haft sin table and include the seven items which start with letters ""s"" . There are also different ways to be successful in life. Some think that it comes from taking risks or chances, and others think that it results from careful planning. It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs.In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us.In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable. Besides, it’s also an environment problem, exhaust fumes engulfed the earth, more car is used, more exhaust gas release, we are killing our mother. First reason is that there is no certain answer for the success. Like the first sentence in the essay, what people think of the success is different for everyone. Some people say that a tripp by car is more convenient that by the public transportation, but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations.It is true that travel to a nearby place from your city, it  is more comfortable getting there by car, and the ease of have your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time paying  cabs. Therefore, some of the success might not require risks to achieve. Instead, since everyone will have some personal opinion about the success, having a careful plan toward their own goal will be necessary. Waiting for the chances to come with just thinking about the success will not lead them to the successful path. For example, some people can think of success as a ""successful relationship with others."" In this situation, taking risks or chances are actually not required for their ""success."" Instead, careful plans of their actions and behaviors toward the people around them will be highly recommended for their true ""success."" In another case, some people might think of their success as a noticable accomplishment. However, there is no destination with only one path. I bought shoes, clothes and GPS watch,I told myself:now it is a challenge, I must defeat myself .The first day is so painful, I was tired to die when I just ran nearly 3km, but things becomes better and better, and now I could run 10km. Second reason is that chances come from planning. Chances are surely one of the best opportunities for people to advance to the higher level. However, grabbing those chances are not that easy, and the plans must be the base of it. There is a phrase saying ""Prepared one can grab a chance."" This indicates that whatever chance comes to people, they can't grab it unless they are prepared for it. Therefore, planning for the success must be the first step to the success, and chances are things that people can expect as the second step toward the success. My town is very beautiful and I like it very much because it is not any dirty streets in it  The governor of my city seek to develop it and he said it will be the capital of delta actually after 30 years ago the people in my town deal with rubbish by healthy method , the citizens collecting the rubbish and threw it in big boxes far away the city. There must be some risks or chances during the way to the success. There can't be no risk. In these situations, it is impossible to clearly say that everyone will successfully handle their risks. One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance,  homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society. The biggest anecdote, that I have with my friend, was our trip to Disney world.Where we could visit all the parks of Disney , like Animal Kingdom ,Hollywood studios and Magic kingdom.In adittion we could visit others parks, like Universal and Bush Garden. Planning doesn't contain only the steps to the destination.. The village I live, there is a lot of vegetation for that reason we try to protect environment, some of the things we do is to give mantainance every week to the vagetation zone checking if there is any garbage, to avoid this we teach the younger´s enviromentalist actions so they don´t throw cans,paper,or,candies to the floor they also can help the older people, there are cases which a person throws garbage to the street´s,floor or to the vegetation to avoid that happening again we have a punishment that is to pay some money if the don´t they wont be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again, unless they were visitors, in that case we told him or her the way we live in the village and, we give him or her advises to keep a beautiful place without garbage. All of these will provide the guideline for people who can be lost in their way by the failure to the risks. For example, some people might have failed some missions which should have been done according to their plans and the extra time formed unfortunately. That means he is a careless, who always drives too fast  But public transport has advantages: If we uses it is the essential transport to travel. If there is nothing to do, then they can think about another plan that can lead them faster toward the success. Careful plans are mostly necessary for the success because there is no certain answer for the success, chances can be grabbed with planning, and plans provide guidelines. Taking risks and chances are not unnecessary, and they are also helpful for taking the success, but plans will be more necessary because this will be the base form of the every step while pursuing the success."	3.5

"Dear editor, @CAPS1 do you do all day? The answer to that would probably be sit down in front @ORGANIZATION1 a computer all day. My friends say that this is very unhealthy, research as proven it and my mom has had experience with the computers. This just isn't healthy for our envierment and people. Then if you want we could go to the restaurant of the city later if you want we could fiand a job for three months, in my opinion a good job for three months I could be the waiter because the waiter get much money in the three months of the summer. Most people who interact on the computer all day don't have a stable diet or even a good excersice ruinte. They say that all the junk kids and grown-ups acumulate in their daily life is unhealthy and will never go away unless they get up. Sometimes, some tv shows are so great that helps you in determinate class,for example, Animal Plante can help you in biology, The History can help in history, etc... In my opinion the television can be good as books, and can also be a form of learning as good as only reads books, because TV is something fun, so you can learn and have fun at the same time. Dr. @ORGANIZATION1 has done extensive research and has proven that computers are bad for you. @PERSON1 has gone all over the country to talk to people, and he specifically stresses that more people should get out and enjoy the nature but, no their sitting in front @ORGANIZATION1 a computer which is not good for them. He's taught people that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 the time if you get out and have fresh air your life will be so much better. My mom has had experience with computers and asures me that when she was younger you couldn't just sit there and not get out. She says that it's important to interact with your family and friends so you keep a stable relationship. Talking to your family will keep them intact with @CAPS1's going on in your life and hanging out with your friends will help with having more @ORGANIZATION1 a life without your household. Then if you want we could go to the restaurant of the city later if you want we could fiand a job for three months, in my opinion a good job for three months I could be the waiter because the waiter get much money in the three months of the summer. Editor you've done a wonderful job since you've taken the job! Strange things happen in the house, they are ""intruders"" in the house, anne saw many times someone called victor who ""play`s"" and the mother thinks she is lyeing but after a while she believe her and started searching for the intruders. I'm sure your next article will be a wonderful dream to people stating facts."	3.5
513	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"COVID-19 has changed our daily life. We never forget to wear masks, and we never
go to a place where lots of people gather. Similarly, college policies changed a lot. Colleges
started to teach students online. Some people disagree with online lecturing because they
think students can not concentrate on studies through the internet. However, in my opinion,
taking online courses in college has advantages. First of all, online courses save both teachers&#39; and students&#39; time. While I were in ANDRAPRADESH every year we have Christmas function in December although we are not interested to attend Drama they were not leave us without participation even simple character.They gave me a character like THE GOD .Firstly I never aware about how act and do this particular character.And from October to till December we practise everyday after our study hour up to eleven ""O""CLOCK.DAY BY DAY  I learn and finally I did my role well.Then I think myself why I wasted all my school days . So, they do not waste their time on commuting. According to the information donne, the most used is the car thus most of the families has one, but the public transportation is getting more and more common for those ones who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectfully with the planet. Since teachers provide videos that they record before the class, they do not
need to spend their time to make students concentrate on the lecture as on offline classes. The second advantage of taking online courses is that it offers students a better
understating of lectures. This is because students are able to watch lecture videos again. Using my personal experience as an example, when I miss what the teacher says during the
offline course, I have no choices but inferred the context. I think my town really take care of the environment,because there are a lot of parkｓ in this town and these are very clean.However　some people are not care of environment　that mean some people throw garbage away in the park.I think almost everyone loves parks because a lot of people go to the park and having　lunch,picnic,excersise,nap etc.I think after eat something at the park then clean themselves is good. Sometimes the employers do strike and we clients do not known in time as a result we can not get on time to work,that is one of the disadvantages of using public transport. To summarize, online courses have advantages to both teachers and students in
college because it saves their time and gives an opportunity to students to understand the
lectures. Abortion is an immoral act that people make as everyone has a chance to survive and nobody has the right to decide for anyone life.Abortion has to be taken seriously in order to avoid these immoral action as these fetus are being deprive of their right since they have already a life.People had to be sensitize about abortion in order to decrease the number of women being abort.Furthermore,abortion is very dangerous and a great number of women had been death with this.Children has to be protected before and after life,it is why abortion has to be stop I also recommend other students to take online courses and teachers to conduct
online classes."	3.5
514	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 of the most important inventions of the past decades is the computer, and it has its pros and cons. I think people spend to much time on computers, especially teenagers. They spend to much time on @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, and not enough time outside enjoying nature and playing sports or exercising. While they @MONTH1 talk with friends with @CAPS4, it is not the same as going to the park with friends and playing a game of baseball. Families also are distant form each other when they sit around on @CAPS5. But, the public transportation have a lot of future bacase a lot of reassons, first the time, if the place you want to reach finally is really far the different type of vehicles of public transportation will get you there faster than your car, also the complications about the field, like if you want to go from America to Europe there is no highway that cross the ocean you need an airplane and unless you have one, you will cannot reach travel between continents with your car, a different reasson is politics, because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska you will not need to pass through Canada, the commodity is a really important reasson because drive for 8 hours is exhausting and it will be unsafe also, the economics is a factor to, because the attrition of your car it will be more that in the normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do, it will be expensive that in public transportation. I sure we all know at least @CAPS1 obese person or teenager. Them they drink a cafe that give them many energy to construct faster the building, this café has a combination for the people can to live all the night. There was a island that each year in some moth come a hurricane this island is located  in a equator then the people went to this island currently but they can´t went when the hurricane is there because they can dead in the hurricane. I strongly believe that grammar is not the most important element to speak English, if you know grammar you only know certain rules to write, but I think that speaking is most important than writing, because when you go to anyplace in the world, you have to be prepared to talk and understand whatever they say to you; in this part you may notice that if you don't know vocabulary, you wouldn't unsderstand anything; but here is another topic, whether you understand or not, you have to notice the way that people talk to you, and try to realize what the person is trying to say. I will bet that everyone who reads this knows someone like my neighbor. In the end, large colleges admit largest number of students, so the student may do establishing friendships more from different nationalities, also it serves the community by graduating many students in various majors. In the future,people will go out of the Earth .Because of the damage,people on the ground can't survive.When they want to find foods,there will be nothing.Even of the grass can't alive on earth.Thought,but most people do not be the member of the team of alive.Cause of lots of damage,but they didn't Take responsibility.I wonder for sixteen years.And I don't know if they were change their mind in after the next fifty years. Instead of going to the gym or the soccer field with friends, they got to the computer and talk and eat junk food. They spend their time watching pointless @CAPS5 videos, while they should be playing baseball or football. Doubters say you learn hand-eye cordination with computers, but you can learn better with sports. Computers are a large factor in obesity because they encourage @CAPS1 to sit around instead of doing standard @NUM1 minutes a day of exercise. The next pressing issue is the amount of reading the average teenager and @CAPS9 does. I would say that the average gets about @NUM2 minutes of reading a day because they are to busy chating with friends on the @CAPS6. I have a cousin who reads about a book every @NUM3 years and fail every test he gets and has stayed back @NUM4 times, but instead of reading and learning, he is chating and texting. He wastes these excellent educational opportunitys while their are people in underdevolped countries like @LOCATION3 who are lucky to own a book. I know more than @PERCENT2 of the kids in my class do not read anything execpt the required reading and that is because they sit around on the computers wasting @CAPS10 is about @NUM5 and that number is decreasing because of the lack of reading done and the time on computers spent. I have seen survey that say @NUM6 out of @NUM7 spend more than @NUM6 hours a day on computers. These statistics and quotes have left me thinking, how much time do we really need to spend on computers instead of reading or else we will turn into oversized monkey who can't even rad. The computers and @CAPS6 are doing more than just erasing brain cell and are health, they are taking away the expriences that we could have outside in nature. we bocome not only older but also wiser .we learn but the most useful thing to learn is to get in alot of experiences & for sure to make mistakes .but we have to be honest with our selves by admitting our mistakes to avoid them in the future . What beats sking down a large slope, or climbing the @LOCATION1, certainly not computers. Environmental changes really need in the current situation.People contribuation is very important in this matter.The report explains how my town people taking care of my surroundings and to preserve this planet in a betterway. They sit and tap on the keyboard instead of walking nature trails and walking on the beaches. They sit on old moldy chairs and stare at computer screens, unlike the people enjoying the butterfly gardens and wildlife preserves. Instead of taking steps to help the enviorment we are siting on the computers sleeping and being mesmerized by the light of the screen. We should be preserving and learning abouy what is left on the planet, but we are not because of these computes and the @CAPS6. I have present a strong arguement against computers that you @MONTH1 listen to or not. I strongly urge you to take action to start reduce time on computers spent. Set up programs at your house or town for turning off the computers. We need to do something now!"	3.5

"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that there is a massive increase in people using computers in society. @CAPS2 can have its positive effect on people, but too much of @CAPS2 isn't a good thing. Spanih´s food is fantastic, althouh there are a lot of restaurant for eat you and i think that the food is more expensive than your country.If you don´t like spanish´s food you can go restaurant the other country, but i know you love it. We all know using computers helps people with all different kinds of things. They can help with business, interacting with family and friends, and you could even just use @CAPS2 for entertainment. Consider both aspects that can be concluded that government should respect the human right and set up a new department which use for people who want to apply to complete the military service. There should be some way of telling the people that this is happening and is a concern. So I think that we should try to combine what people like to do on computers, with what they should be doing more often, like exercising. we bocome not only older but also wiser .we learn but the most useful thing to learn is to get in alot of experiences & for sure to make mistakes .but we have to be honest with our selves by admitting our mistakes to avoid them in the future . We all know that computers can be a good and bad thing. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about places and people in the world, and so much more. They also have bad effects, but that doesn't mean we should take them away from people. And you shouldn't be outside all the time, for the whole day. So I think there should be a limit on how many hours people spend on the computers per day. This way, people get what they want, and they have some time off of @CAPS2, too. Obviously as a result there should be something done about this computer concern. I hope I have persuaded you with my well-thought out thoughts and ideas. And hopefully they will lead you to an idea that will end in a helpful change in society."	3.5
516	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"In modern era, a crucial issue about  the cause of affecting positive/negative effect to young adults is discussed by many people. Some people believe that the family is the most important influence on young adults, while other people claim that friends are the most important influence on young adults. In this essay, I argue that the family is the most important influence on young adults for some reasons. I know that I am a suitable person for this job, and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job, because I have been travelled for all the world and in this experience, I have seen in the necesity on work to fiance my journey, so the I have dedicated to work on summer camps, and I have a lot of experience in this. In many times, people try to join the groups like friends(it is not exception), clubs, etc. In this shopping center I bought new blue skirt.After that we went our favorite art-cafe.We like it because cafe has beautiful design and tasty food .After that we went to walk on embankment.It is all our plan.Hope to hear from you soon! Many people want to make these relationships, and in lots of situation, they may get some stress from these situations. However, family is the only group that people join without some trying. It can make many people comfortable, and it can also decrease the stress from social relationships because of the reaction of blocking relationship from outside. Therefore, family can make the most important influence to many people. Second, family is the base of behavior for many people. For many people, the house and family is the base of many social or rest behavior. For example, many young adults sometimes play outside with friends, trip to out of local place, and etc., and they almost  think about the effect of family or house in the first of planning. It can be the clue to the opinion in this essay. Despite these specific logical  reasons for my opinion, some people still claim that friends make most important influence to young people because of the group that share most times to play with and the group that share their active or hobby. Although these reasons are also valid opinions, I still argue that the family is the most important influence to young adults because family also share their hobbies like ""family picnic"", and they are the main people to know many people's mind and pain. But, in this moment the people think different, is to start to help the world and  Contamination is big problem for us and the planet. In addition, family also give great positive effect to study to many students in schools or universities. Then, how about to go to your family and explain about their positive effect with ""Thanks""?"	3.5
517	"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"From birth to young adulthood, kids are raised by their guardians or parents. Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe, in fact there is some important tournament where participate all important Europe team,They are called ""Champions League"" and ""Europa League"".football is a team sport in fact in this sport participate everyboby without exclude nobody. @CAPS24 parenting children requires being firm and strictly reinforcing rules. The result of this however, is the child leaves their parents prepared to live their adult lives outside the home.It is safe to say that although I am a still a teenager, I have learned quite a lot about raising kids. My knowledge mostly being based off of stories passed down to me by my parents and grandparents about their life lessons. Being ""in on"" these small, yet significant bits of history is quite enjoyable for me. I'd have to say that although many of the facts about the ""good old days"" are great, it is the almost tangible memories which my family connects with laughter that are the most significant to me. My @CAPS1 grew up in the @DATE1's living in a small yet average sized house with her @CAPS1, @CAPS3, and four brothers and sisters. The main subject which is the focus of the stories my @CAPS1 retells about her childhood come from memories made at the dinner table. It was her @CAPS5's (my @CAPS6's) goal, for his children to learn proper manners and standard etiquette. In my opinion, Family is the place that had you best friend can help each other and know each.In the Taiwan,many of people have to take care of them parent when they get old,but the point is what if you can not survival,I mean you don't have enough money to raise you parent.Back to the topic,I don't know well any of member of in my family,I don't trust them,honestly. For an average, fun, causal, and not so dignified @CAPS7 family, that was a lot to ask. Throughout their childhood my @CAPS1 and her siblings tried their very best to behave and do as they were told at the dinner table. The only common occurrence that was particularly displeasing to my @CAPS6 was when someone spilled their milk. This fateful event happened almost every night. My name is Abrar saeed Al-mubarak.I'm 13 years old.I live in Saudi Arabia(Riyadh)  .And i'm in grade nine.I have 9 sisters with me we 10 .And 9 brothers.I really love to learn English lounge & French lounge spinach lounge  .And I speak Arabic . Whatever the reason, it was somehow hysterically funny when this occurred. The only catch was, that laughing at the table was frowned upon for it seemed to break the formal mood the family strove for during the evening meal. Laughing and spilling milk were two actions not encouraged at the dinner table. However, I have no agree with this statement because the public transport is needed for someone who are no have vehicle or economic downturn. in modern day there is very little public transpotr are used,ganeral public prefer much faster and conveninece  ways of traveling  around.though the pulic transport are used in mager citys to avoied traffic conjustion,it is wlidly reconizge that public transport are eco friendly. Instead, it was my @CAPS6. When the initial incident occurred, the whole family was in a state of shock. In effort to clean up the mess everyone donated their napkin, while their @CAPS3 maintained a controlled but disgruntled demeanor. When all was cleaned up, the family went on with their meal and on my @CAPS6's face was a subtle yet unmistakable grin. When anyone miss to pass the ball or miss scored a goal we shouting on his face are you crazy how you missed this goal ! Most of my @CAPS1's family lives in @LOCATION2 so they enjoyed coming up to visit their @CAPS1 and @CAPS3 (my @CAPS21 and @CAPS6) at the holidays or whenever they were able. During these times when the entire family is able to gather here in @LOCATION1, there is hardly ever a somber or serious moment at the dinner table. As my @CAPS3 would say, ""@CAPS24 we laugh so hard that tears run down our legs."" I studied in Kuwait schools , after that I joined Damascus university , the faculty of human medicine , I graduated from it in 2008 with very good grade , then I got the Master's degree in laboratory medicine from the same university (Ministry of Higher Education ) in 2013 with Excellent grade . I feel that my @CAPS6 (who is now in heaven with @CAPS21), accomplished the goal of preparing his children for life. I notice that in supermarkets are using so much plastic just to cover a small thing or are using many plastic bags without even think how vulnerable is for the environment."	3.5
518	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is bad for health, not just for the smoker but also the people around them. The service is very bad the drivers are very angry and stressed out these do not lead with cauition, in Toluca exist report of high rates of accidents by buses. If smoking is not completely banned, many diners will either have to suffer in silence and be engulfed in the smoke or to choose alternative place to dine in. The reason for it being completely banned and not partially or fully unbanned is simple. Smoke can diffuse easily in air which can spread to a much further location from the point where the smoker is. The foul smoke from the smoker can easily affect many tables around him. I have to start saying that I never imagine swimming like my favorite sport, because until my back´s injury, I practiced other sports, I most like extreme sports like downhill, skateboarding martial arts like Aikido, jiujitsu or ninjutsu, but for my injury I have to start swimming and now I love it. Thus, other non smoking diners will still be able to smell the smoke. Another reason for banning smoking is that it encourages smokers to quit smoking. With lesser place to smoke in, it will make smoking more inconvenient and can have a positive effect on smokers. Some may argue that smokers have their right to do what they want but if this right infringes on others who have the right to have fresh air, the smokers should just give in. In conclusion, we are assisting to a new tend in transport, every time, they are faster and more developer, with the latest technology included but at the oppossite case, we find also a contradiction, as we found an other trend for the tradictional transport which avoid the pollution in order to respect the Earth I think one of my favorites sports of all is the atletism I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself, you have to be every day better than you where yesterday, it force you to improve every time, also is an exercise that help all your body, especially the legs because it gives them great strength, but also your hands because they have to be in a constant movement, and all the body in general because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and help you to have coordination."	3.5

"hello  my name is Mustafa I am 23 years old and I am Student in collage I search for job but I don't find a job I wish that my country become a great country and better and I wish to married who I love her  thank you We go on computers for research, writing papers, or just for pure entertainment, in all these ways computers are very helpful. But, like all good things, too much computer time can be harmful. Sure they provide our lives with knowledge, info on the outside world, & connections with people from just about anywhere, but some of us become too attached with this virtual life instead of living our own real lifes. They were talking about their lives and  he remembered like he knew her on the bus, maybe  she have always been the woman of his live he looked at eyes and smile he wants to ask her whether now is not late to satart to know her but he decided leave the pub he walked to exit. For most people, life @MONTH1 be challenging & the real world to stressing, so they retire to the computer for awhile, & to me this is fine, but when someone were to keep doing this it would become an addiction. Instead of relaxing by taking a walk or reading a book, they go to the computer, this would not be good for their social life or their minds. In my opinion, minds need to think, they need excerise by puzzling over something or figuring out a problem. Sizdehbedar: It means Thirteenth day of spring , on this day people going picnic and spent the day out of  their homes on the nature because they believe that Thirteen number that brings bad luck for them . But it could reach its full potential by doing something else thats not straining your eyes so much. Computers can be good, but not for everything in your life. Now what about your social life Computers can be a helpful resource in many ways, but not if you let them become a destruction. This @MONTH1 happen by letting the computer be your constant companion. Now a days people have come up with online games where you can interact with other people. This isn't neccessarily bad unless your whole social life is only with these online people that you really don't know, instead of with real people that you see at school or meet on the everyday streets so what I'm saying is that a talking with people online isn't bad as long as you put them as secondary friends & have real people come first. There are a few people are using puplic transport, like students and someone had low income.in my veiw, i can say might be the puplictransport going to e close because nobody is going to beclose By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we don't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars don't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport. If you do that you will most likely have a much more balanced lifestyle. Making you, your friends, & family a whole lot happier."	3.5
520	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"There are lots of moments for choices in life. Some believe that success in life comes from the choice that takes risks or chances, while others believe that careful planning would result in success. In my opinion, careful planning is more important to achieve success for several reasons. One day many years ago in something place that a don't remember the name I woke up one morning more earlier than usual then I went to the kitchen and shout the name of my mother...but no one answered, and the first thing that I imagine is that they come to the town, quickly I went out to find they... But there was no one, absolutely no one, I'm scary, I yell and scream, look and look but I had no result  Suddenly I felt a warm hand that touched my shoulder and very slowly turn but the only thing I saw was a shadow that was holding a knife     I woke up and realised it had all been a bad dream The plan is a part of the preparation, so it is preceded to make any decision. In the end,if it is a good sheet,the porcedure is packaging and distribution,including cutting into separate bank notes,packing,dispatching.If it is a bad sheet,the porcedure is disposal    --bad sheetsand bank notes should be securely destroyed. The one who is already prepared can get the chance, so the plan should be always prepared. In addition, precise planning could reduce the time to reach success. Though the plan is perfect, unexpected situations can occur, then they should be dealt with proper solutions that are already developed. As a result, there would be no wasted time considering new factors, and risks that can happen would be blocked. Some argue that brilliant discoveries, inventions, and research have been achieved by taking risks; however, they would be based on careful planning. My advice of finding work, is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work.But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase. Careful planning is needed for any moment; for example, during preparation, work, and concluding steps. To sum up, planning is important for achieving success because it is necessary for starting work and sufficient plans can reduce time. Egypt have more historical places such as pyramids is the one of empirical in the world and more people from around the wold come to see this pyramids the wold think how Egyptian people make this building from may be thousand year and still stand without change and more tourist come to take photo in the pyramids and study the stone and how the old Egyptian make this one without modern tools such as cranes and other modern machine more scientific teams come from all the world to study this building and make Egyptian science in more universities around the world to study how the air going inside this building and how it keep the food inside it and how this big stone takes out from far places and come for this place and how this building keep the body of the people after died and how this people leave inside the building and why this building like this and what the benefit of this building and how to make kike this building"	3.5

"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer blinked to life and an image of a blonde haired girl filled the screen. It was easy to find out how life was in @LOCATION2, thanks to the actual @CAPS1 girl explaining it. Going to the library wouldn't have filled one with this priceless information and human interection. Computers are a nessessity of life if soceity wishes to grow and expand. They should be supported because they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and allow people to talk to others online. I would like to say for anyone wants playing soccer to be very careful when he plays it because it may cause a lot of injures ,but in the same time it is very nice game. Hand-eye coordination is a useful ability that is usod to excel in sports. In a recent survey, @PERCENT1 of kids felt their hand eye coordination improves after computer use. Even a simple thing like tying can build up this skill. Famous neurologist @CAPS2 @PERSON1 stated in an article last week that, ""@CAPS3 and computer strength the @CAPS2. When on the computer, you automatically process what the eyes see into a command for your hands."" @CAPS4 hand eye coordination can improve people in sports such as baseball and basketball. If someone wan't to become better in these sports, all they'd need to do was turn on the computer. Once people become better at sports, they're more likely to play them and become more healthy. First of all,tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world.Alongside with its development,the ablity of travalling has easened to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another.The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism,as well as with the idea of globalisation,since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen. Additionaly, computers allow people to access information about faraway places and people. If someone wanted to reasearch @LOCATION1, all they'd need to do was type in a search would be presented to them in it would link forever to search through countless things. The future of public transport in developed countries is very different, because most people have a car, in   the people who live in poor countries, most people take public transport, because people doesn´t have a car and is cheaper take public transport, the pollution of public transport is huge and is growing third world countries should have, eco friendly transport. Increase tolerance people are. i don't know my name .i don't know my age all i know about that i want to be a great woman ,i want the world to hear my voice , to prove that i can do it  i can do any thing  i am not weak i have woman power Lastly, computer and in technology can allow people to chat. Computer chat and video chat can help the all different nations. Bring on good terms places other than can help us understand story comes out about something that happend in @LOCATION3, people can just go on their computer and ask an actual @LOCATION3 citizen their take on the matter. Also, video chat and online conversation can cut down on expensive phone bills. No one wants to pay more than they have to in this economy. Another good point is that you can acess family members you scaresly visit. This is due to Lima in the beginning  has not had a pant to desing its public road s and highways, and it only has been improvising to build their way without any criteria to transport its population. One they animals went with Ana and give her an incentive for being an athlete or make something else than stay sleeping. their advancements push the world foreward to a better place. Computers can help people because they help teach handeye coordination, give people the bility to learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with others. Think of a world with no computers or technologicall advancements. The world would be sectored and unified, contact between people scare, and information even. The internet is like thousands or librarys put together. Nobody would know much about other nations and news would travel slower. Is that the kind of palce you want people to live in?"	3.5

"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I strongly believe that people should cut down on using the computer. Just imagine, more people outside and healthy. Less “cyberspace” bullying, and less burning of electricity. My first reason why people should spend less time on the computer and more outside is because @PERCENT1 of people that use the computer more than two hours a day are either at risk of being overweight or are overweight. Also, @PERSON1, from @ORGANIZATION1 says “@CAPS2 people believe that using the computer gives you benefits, but they don’t. They increase your chances of either being overweight or getting diseases such as diebeties. Everybody thinking like the public transport is not comfort for us, but environmentally the public transport is suitable to decrease the pollution and our energy sources also decrease. “In addition, my neighbor, @PERSON2 had to do a study to interview overweight adults and teenagers. @CAPS3 told me that @PERCENT2 of the @NUM1 people @CAPS3 interviewed said they don’t go outside and use the computer for about @NUM2 hours a day! I implore the citizens of the @LOCATION1 area to cut down on internet time and go outside to enjoy nature. My second reason is the less people on the computer means less cyberspace bullying. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people that use the socializing websites have experienced more than @NUM2 encounters of cyberbullying also my sisters friend, @PERSON3, overdosed on advil so @CAPS3 ran comitt suicside because of cyber bullying. Someone had said @CAPS3 was ugly, smelled and should ""go die in a hole."" For some reasons, I really liked to play basketball, first, playing basketball can train my muscle and make the body more healthier ; the second, my classmates and I all know how to win a game through the basketball game because the basketball game is a teamwork. Luckily her mother brought her to @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1 fast enough to be put on life support for @NUM6 hours. furthermore, if people cut down on internet socializing website than less people will be in danger of cyberbullying affecting their lives. It's excruciating imperative for people to use the computer for only @NUM7 or @NUM8 hours a day. The village I live, there is a lot of vegetation for that reason we try to protect environment, some of the things we do is to give mantainance every week to the vagetation zone checking if there is any garbage, to avoid this we teach the younger´s enviromentalist actions so they don´t throw cans,paper,or,candies to the floor they also can help the older people, there are cases which a person throws garbage to the street´s,floor or to the vegetation to avoid that happening again we have a punishment that is to pay some money if the don´t they wont be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again, unless they were visitors, in that case we told him or her the way we live in the village and, we give him or her advises to keep a beautiful place without garbage. Dr. @DR1, from the peabody museum in @LOCATION2 begs people to use less electricity and power on the internet so the environment can slowly rebuild itself to be what it was before technology and electricity was invented. the most family member I love and think she is the best friend of mine , my sister , she is elder me about 12 years , I can tell her any thing about my life , my self , my feelings ,hhh also i think if i felt in love she would be the first to know that . Also my grandmother is astounded by what todays technology is doing to the environment and the people behind this madness or electricity. The best season to sale the ice cream from the van is autumn,while that is one of the worst season for indoor swimming pool.The discrepancy of these two place is large.The best sale achievement of the van is 4500,5000,5500respectively. Lastly, it's extremly imperative that people stop using computers as much to help their health their self estem and environment. A case take action to stop using computer @NUM9. Thank you for reading my paper."	3.5
523	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"It was during @CAPS1 class that we visited the library to look at various books. One of which, that my teacher picked up, was '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Right @CAPS5' by @PERSON2. you must think a little bit before you talk as  one word causes a lot of pain for others for the rest they lives .you may not  actually notice that but you  will feel what am really mean if  someone tells you a painful words . I found that book to be very offensive just because I was looking at it from a modern perspective. Nowadays it would be considered sexist to assume that women should stay home and take care of the house while men work outside of the home. Just because it was a piece of literature that I didn't agree with, doesn't mean that it's not a valued work. In my opinion ,Volleyball must then be considered among high-risk sports according to the frequency and gravity of our surgical findings.my advice for who starts this sport you will get fresh after you play this game and makes you doing your work in relaxetion way . There is such a wide variety of people who search through the library, so finding a certain piece of material that not one person finds offensive is nearly impossible. In my opinion ,Volleyball must then be considered among high-risk sports according to the frequency and gravity of our surgical findings.my advice for who starts this sport you will get fresh after you play this game and makes you doing your work in relaxetion way . There are some big shelves in center of market are divided to some different parts for kinds of goods like Dried fruit, nuts, flour, condiment, beans, grains, rice, etc. Censoring those works would be considered a violation to the freedom of expression. People of all ages look through the library to find books or music or magazines. Each of those people has a different belief. What is considered a work of art to one person could be seen as highly offensive to another. If  libraries were to start censoring their books, then the result would be a small selection of drab, emotionless materials. People visit the library to find materials that they are interested in, or look around to expand their interests. Libraries need to contain a wide variety of material to satisfy this knowledge.A library's job is to educate the people who enter it. A good form of education is the exposure to different types of material. Sometimes the offending nature of a novel is what makes it good. It gets the reader thinking about what the author's purpose was. They are called below: 1- chaharshanbeh soori 2- Norouz 3- sizdehbedar  chahrshanbeh soori:  It meaning Tuesday night of week and take place on last Tuesday night of the year .at this night people make a bonfire and jump over the fires and say to fire :I give you my sign of sickness(yellow color)and you give me your healthy sign (red color)and eat some special foods . Finally, Taiwan still suffers economic slump, but we have so many businesses likes to innovate, market their product, customers likes to buy it. As a result, that book was banned from libraries and schools. Now, it is seen as one of the most famous works in @CAPS7 literature. That example proves that material that's reguarded as offensive, shouldn't automatically have its value lowered. 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' as said by Katherine Paterson, is an accurate depiction of the outcome of a library with censorship on its materials. Part of what make a good work great, is its ability to stir up controversy among its readers. I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked.Pleasure to work at concerts is when  I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate.The experience  is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert."	3.5

"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 would you want to do in your spare time? Would you go outside and maybe @CAPS3 the soccer ball around with your kids, or grab a bag of chips and log onto facebook or your email? Fdi can play important role in it.It give competition to national companies .By virtue of which they  work properly mannerly and give better option to policy holders.people can always buy nominal premium we should aware them about the types of insurance as well as benefits of the insurancce. I believe that computers have a negative effect. To begin with,the format of the bank notes needs to be designed,factors of considerations including the background colour,the artwork and the security issues.Sencondly,equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps.Thirdly,print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink,where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes. Going on the computer can also be very addicting. Finally, it take's away from all the exercise you need. I @CAPS4 that after careful consideration you will agree with me that computers have a negative effect on people. Facebook, ichat and email are all fun and easy ways to talk to your friends and family online. However, are you really gaining any social skills by doing this? Talking to friends and family online doesn't help you have good social skills. We the management of The Arch London Hotel received your mail and wishes to let you know that you should make known to us the position you desired to work in via return mail along with a scan copy of your signed contract of agreement to enable us make every necessary corrections.Thank you. Typing on a keyboard doesn't really let you interact with people. my father  my father name is Zaheer arat.he is very loving and caring.they gives us all the facilities one should have and dream of these things.he provides all the facilities to us of internet and books so that we can learn better and can be good students and get good marks in the examination.he always encouraged us and said don't afraid of anything because you are braver than anything else.my brothers and me proud of my father.he is very hard working and brave.he has the smiley face.he always tries to laugh other people with their jokes.he always listens to us what we want.he never ever ignore us. Computers also are very addicting. I can say for myself that once I log onto the computer, I might not be off for the next hours. so, on my opinion, even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers Going on the computer is addicting. Il @CAPS4 that not everyone is using a computer on a daily basis the vast majority of people are. When I'm on facebook and I see the number of people online is one hundred or even two hundred, as time goes by, the number increases. The computer being addicting leads to getting enough exercise. Doctors say that adults and kids should get atleast an hour of exercise a day. Going on the computer takes away from this time. Instead of sitting on the computer for an hour, you could be getting your hour of exercise. instead A lot of times when someone @CAPS5 down at the computer, a snack goes with them. This just adds onto the fact @CAPS6 getting the exercise is important to stay healthy. Frist of all at home we recycle plastics, glasses, papers and cartons, oils, clothes, batteries, organics in an especial composting bank where we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials and finally all the other things are sends to an especial tip where we avoid to drop it anywhere. You are probably saying that you have time to manage both, but some people would rather exercise. When these people see you on the computer, @CAPS2 kind of example does it set? this country are many interesting pLaces to visit,if you wantto have adventure you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza.If you want to have fun you may go to parque de la Costa there are many interesting rolercoasters.And if you want to go the best museum of art in Argentina you should go to malba. for example, lunch time travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emission of carbon mono oxide which is effected to red blood cells and irritate to breathing system."	3.5
525	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"As a non-smoker, it would be easy for me to advocate the banning of smoking across all restaurants in the country. However, I do believe that we have to take into account the interests of smokers to a certain degree. The primary issue at stake is second-hand smoke, which is a problem that arises when smoking is permitted in a place that non-smokers do frequent. I decided and went.It was strange because I never went to the sports.From the time I started going to karate.After one month my instructor told me that I will go to the competition.I was very worrying and nervous. Health is a concern for every individual, and allowing others to compromise this is immensely undesirable. Looking for any sport make you feel good and your brain be always refresh so that you  can begin your day with any sport to making fresh and after that you can make any job with refreshment mind. It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swimming and also when the age become older it will be more difficult to learn than the little . Although this ""vice"" may not be easy for everyone to ""forgive"", we have to recognise that these people, too, have interests that they seek to maximise. How, then, can we cater to the interests of both parties? I believe that it is possible to come to a degree of compromise. We're looking for a new nice home and so we are truly interested to keep your place tide and take care about it as it were our own. Care must be taken, however, to separate these areas sufficiently (perhaps by glass panels or the like) such that the smoke does not permeate non-smoking areas. The restaurants, then, will also lose neither their smoking customers nor their non-smoking patrons. In this way, we can maximise the benefits to all stakeholders in question."	3.5
526	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"I disagree that having a part time job is important to a college student. I have played this sport for twelve years ago this sport has taught me to respect the other not assault to him.there is the only reason that makes me choose this sport is I don't want to be weak I wouldn't like to be nothing in this country that has a rule Strong dominated the weak.when I put my feet in the gym i forget everything shcool,home...therefore I enjoy it.I can't imagine my life without taekwondo it is my blood,my soul.taekwondo it is not a violent sport as many people say but what you have to know is what in the brain and the heart of players.I just get the 1st degree international black belt and I would like to tell to anyone he just starting this sport use your abilities and skills for the right things. I think one of my favorites sports of all is the atletism I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself, you have to be every day better than you where yesterday, it force you to improve every time, also is an exercise that help all your body, especially the legs because it gives them great strength, but also your hands because they have to be in a constant movement, and all the body in general because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and help you to have coordination. It requires a lot of time and effort for such a commitment. A college student without much skill would be left to do manual labour and paid low wages. Time is very precious to a college student (in contrast to a secondary school student), and the amount of time and effort is simply not worth a few bucks per hour. However, should the student have spare time on his or her hands, it would be good to get a part time job. Having a part time job allows the student to get a taste of the working world and it could be useful in the future when applying for a job. Also, additional income wouldn't hurt anyone. A part time job would be more suitable if it's during the school vacation. while we are spendind good time watching TV our brain is not in calm, only in an other position different to that ones in the rest od the day.That's why I think that it's a good momento to see the thing through a new glass and that can be a very high opportunity. The student might go to class feeling tired or a lower concentration, affecting his/her studies. It's more important to focus on studies so that we are able to carve our own careers in the future."	3.5

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"To begin with, The learning ability people get from it has improved. The @CAPS1 source is very helpful to many people. However, compared to the line of indoor swimming pool,the difference of seasonal achievement of ice cream van is considerably large.Overall,the achievement of ice cream van is better than the indoor swimming pool,from about 1100 to 5500. I believe that computers benefit the society in many different ways. First of all, children and people at home and at school use computers for learning purposes. In some grades at school there is a special typing program that helps improve typing skills. There are also hard drive discs that you can play with to help you enhance on your reading skills. In my school ages I did not participate any programme even sports.Because school teachers never encourage me to participate.If they told me to attend compulsory I will do without any hesitation. Another great way to learn online is going to websites that have sample math problem and print the sheet out to practice. They are great ways to help learning. Secondly, the computer has many more ways to benifit someone. But in some day tow guise with quad bike and they saw some thing wrong they sad what's that , they sow dead body , they skared and run to ther camp . In the winter you can see if your school has cancelled in seconds. Often I get projects where it calls for me to do research on a specific topic and it is very easy to look up simple information. The computer also has different links that are helpful for writing a paper, making a power point presentation, and excel spread sheet. All of those resources can either help graphing results for science class or even typing up a paper for @CAPS2. Nowadays, the transportation become more prefect,and the people'life become more convenient.Althought this change lend the life of people efficient,the problem should not be ignored.It would really be helpful if the government make tighter resrictions,in today's world ,lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission, they are destroyed the forest,farmland and wetland,charging waster water and emitting greenhouse gas,it lead to a serious enviorment problem.So the government should oversee this companies ,and if companies do not obey the rules or laws ,it will be fined and closed. Lastly, computers tend to make communication a little easier. For me, when I'm out sick from school I like to tell my teachers by emailing them and even asking if I can make up any work using facebook, aim, myspace, and skype are all fun and fast ways to communicate with friends. All of the websites pretty much do the same thing but different people like diffrent sites that their friends are on you can email friends and family who live far away and even close. It's a way to get back and forth to eachother. In conclusion, you have heard the different ideas and I consider computers as a benifit. Tennis, tennis is not jsut a sport anyone can play but it's professional sport needs to more hard trainee and more time to be perfect in it, in first why I choose tennis?, seriously in 2003 this is my first time to watch the game on TV when I saw roger federer played I think he is the one that made me love this sport, due to it's professional motion in playing the ball, from this time I was interested in this game and watching all championship, so more time, time and time it was my favoirite sport."	3.5

"Dear The @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has been an argument wheter computers do or do not have a positive effect on people. The last mistake that I have had to have been when I changed the telephone company because since I changed I have many troubles. However, I believe computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, lets people know about faraway places, and allows people to talk online. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people. When freddy begin to sings the kids screams and they sing with Freddy the famous Freddy Fazbear´s Song,Bonny plays the battery and Chica serves the pizza to the children, This year the stablishment close because they found the body of a dead child. Well, it true because if you are in distress and the phone is broken and you don't have a cellphone then send an emergency e-mail to one of your friends informing them to call all and since you have hand-eye coordination you can type without having to look down. Also if your in college and have an important essay due tomorrow then hand-eye coordination can really help you write down notes without having to look back at the writing paper. Finally, with hand-eye coordination it can help you can join the army because if you spot a threat you can aim and shoot quickly without having to take out the gun after threat attacks. To conclude, computers teaches hand-eye coordination. ""Annabelle"" is a horror movie which i am going to watch this Saturday.I am wondering if i will be scared after the movie.The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was closed in a museum from Conecticut where she is visited  by a preist  who blesses her twice a month.John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife :a beautifull colection doll dressed in a wedding dress.Unfortunatelly,in a horribble night the couple""s house was invided by a satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them.The satanists invoced an eavel entity that is capabale of the worst things...Annabelle.After Mia gives birth to her doughter Lilly,Annabelel wants to kill her.Even the preist doesn's know how to help the unhappy familly.Everyone is terryfied and find out that a demon is attached by the doll.Idon't know the end of the story but i don;t think that is a happy one... firstly, that private transport provide a comfortable mean to travelling from one place to another without sharing stranger people a way and by using this kind of transport also comfortable in free with choosing time of a trip. Fethermore, if you want to learn to speak a forgein language you can all you have to do is type in the language with a question and search its so easy a baby can do it. Finally, if you want to learn how to cook like forgein places do then type in the type of food or its name and search. To summarize, computers lets people know about forgein places. Have you ever have the feeling that you want to talk to somebody? Then ,preparation of mental plates and skilled machinists are the needments.Printing is the next step ,.Usually ,sheets of bank notes printed ,because there are some special require for the printing ,solour of both sides,special ink ,images slightly raised. Also you don't have to waste money on paper and envelopes. Finally, having an e-mail is free so you can talk all you want. To conclude, computers help people talk online. Her mom tried to tell Fernanda that they arrived very late because they had a very perplexed problem, so her mom told her that they came out from the park at 9:00pm it was still late but not too late, so they were on the street and the police arrived because they police thought that she had a globe with wine, and her mother told the police that she doesn't have alcohol or wine on her car, and they police didn't believed her and they took them to the police station so they could check his car, and about 10 minutes approximately they told her that she didn't have nothing so they, went from there to their house and it was late, so that’s the reason. It helps them have hand-eye coordination, learn about new places, and lets them talk."	3.5
529	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In the past, not many of people had their own computers, so taking online courses was not common concept. Due to the development of technology, online courses have become familiar with them. Some people say that learning from online classes has some limitations, such as lack of communication with professors. The son of Lucy and her husband one day he went to caved holes in the dirt for make a game, he make five holes and in the last one he found a brilliant jewelry that had been generations of gods so he started throwing that for play, one time that he take the jewelry, it consume the mind of the little guy and that cause that the jewelry liberated some sounds that only giants can hear so a mountain stand up that was the face of a giant and he perceive negative waves so he kill the guy because he had the most important relic of the gods. It can help them be safe and save their time. First of all, taking online courses is much more safe than offline. Todays, many pandemic diseases have appeared. For example, COVID-19 is spread among people in all around the world and it has high possibility to infect others. One day many years ago in something place that a don't remember the name I woke up one morning more earlier than usual then I went to the kitchen and shout the name of my mother...but no one answered, and the first thing that I imagine is that they come to the town, quickly I went out to find they... But there was no one, absolutely no one, I'm scary, I yell and scream, look and look but I had no result  Suddenly I felt a warm hand that touched my shoulder and very slowly turn but the only thing I saw was a shadow that was holding a knife     I woke up and realised it had all been a bad dream Statistical data proves that people in a room with others are much more susceptible to the infectious diseases than people who are not. If students take online classes, they do not need to meet together, and it is the way to decrease the possibility of infection. Besides the safety issue, it helps students save their time. One day Penny discovered it and it go to tell it to his queen, the queen at knowing that she get very confused but at the same time she get mad and she wanted revenge. My friend who have to take the bus to go her school said, “When I took offline courses, I had to spend a lot of time to go to the university because it is far from my home,” she continued, “it approximately took 2 hours.” However, as a result of taking online courses, she did not need to go there, and she could save 4 hours. Just like her, most of students can save their time, and they can use their time for another important things, such as hobbies and exercises. In conclusion, taking online courses in college has many advantages for students. It makes students be safe and save their valuable time. Although these advantages, online courses have limitations, so some people do not want to take the online courses. However, in the future, the technology will be much more developed, and it could be solved its remained problems."	4
530	You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"The United States: A Country to Visit and Expand Knowledge

    There are many countries worldwide, and lots of people visit foreign countries for various purposes. Going abroad is a source of new experiences. For example, some people may go studying, and some people may want to relax through traveling. Some other people would try to get some inspirations of their life, too. In addition, my major is English so teachers will teach and explain by English, which I can’t catch up on lessons well in the first time. Among varios countries, I would like to visit the USA for three reasons. To begin with, I can experience how the center of global economy is being changed by visiting the USA. One significant point that influences global economy is IT industries. Since many IT corporations, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Google is in the US, visiting these companies would be a great experience to learn what is the vision of these companies and what is their bluepints to expand their future. This might sound unrealistic, however, there might be a chance for me to visit these corporations such as internships. In addition, there is a famous place that represents of world economy, the Wall Street, so by visiting there I can see directly how the global economy is changed by some factors. So for finish competition with pleasure I needed work out plan witch is diary day by day about our jogging distance, time, mood during work out. Learning a foreign language only by myself and university lectures has some limits, and attaining chances to talk and think in the foreign language lively is a great chance to surely get familiar with the language. Therefore, I believe that I can improve my English skills through visiting the US and making many conversations with native English speakers. I believe that the people in a future they will begin to travelling shared car more time and they use less the public transport as the train, the bus, underground, etc. There are many places to visit, from the great nature to the Skyscrapers. For example, we can see the Grand Canyon, the Niagara Falls, the Statue of Liberty, the Metropolitan Museum and Smithonian Museum. The first two will give me refreshment because of the giant pose of the nature, and the third one will make me thrilled to see a large artificial architect built by human. this country are many interesting pLaces to visit,if you wantto have adventure you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza.If you want to have fun you may go to parque de la Costa there are many interesting rolercoasters.And if you want to go the best museum of art in Argentina you should go to malba. So they will expand my point of view and give me various thoughts of what I should do in the future to make my life meaningful. To sum up, I would visit US if I have an opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks, because I can learn global economy, English language, and the brilliant sights of the US. I agree that there are many other beautiful countries to visit. However, for the reasons stated above, I strongly belive that visiting the US will be the most helpful to me."	4
531	University: Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"When I want studying for exams  going to the living room and sitting front of TV In addition, there is a small blackboard for my littel brother because my mother wants my prother learn Arabic and English letters. One of the example is television, in the past we use it only for watching news and movie, but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t, now television has others function. Although not every job needs to have academical information, university should open to everyone. First of all, chances have to be open to everyone. It is not fair to restrict their probabilities to grow to be a well-educated person only because he or she didn’t do well in the past. For example, a boy who didn’t study well in high school can realize that he should study very hard to earn a lot of money after graduating high school. If there is no chance for that person to study in a university, he may be very disappointed and have a hard time finding what he is going to be in the future. Second, universities not only teach professional information but also leadership and communication skills through a lot of social activities and group homework. These skills are important to be a good worker because they need to work with many and various people when they get a job. Since universities can teach them, everyone should be able to get university education. On the other hand, some people say that university or college education should be open only to students who did well in high school because not every job needs professional and academic education. However, although it seems that some jobs need only simple information, for students who want to have ability to improve themselves, they need more education. He seems different, she never imagined that Jason can be like that, she fantasy with someone, brave and strong, and she never foresees something like this, but she feel something for him, maybe she is in love with this guy . Also, universities teach leadership and communication skills that are important to be a good worker. University and college education can make students to be a better person in the future. These are the reasons why university and college education should be open to everyone."	4

So the one important thing to be changed is the location of my school. The people of my town try to plant plants in the centre or somewhere is too smoke, so they try to keep the air at recommended levels.on the morning a lot of people go on footto the work or to the school or ride a bike or they take the bus.The people try to move the local factories out of country where is less air polluted ,less smoke,less cars and more forests and plants. In the perspective of career, most of companies are located in Seoul, and they offer several Intern activity or event for university students. We're looking for a new nice home and so we are truly interested to keep your place tide and take care about it as it were our own. More students can get the more benefits. And there are the more opportunity of cultural activity like concert, exhibition and club activity. We can be more collaborated people. Second, there are more interaction with other university, so we can increase our network and meet various people. In KAIST, there are only science and engineering department. Although KAIST is the top university in the world, we might have narrow thought. If we were in Seoul, we can meet many students in other university and interact with them. So we can get more various thought and network. Also we can learn the other culture to increase our adoption in society. We can get more participation and interaction, if KAIST were in Seoul. I think KAIST in Seoul is the best university in Korea. Also, the students' talent will be increse than now. So if i get a chance to change one thing of our KAIST, i must change our loaction."	4

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear computer experts, @CAPS1 this: A family of four is sitting in a small dark room, not talking, not laughing, just sitting lazily in their chairs, hunched over & bored. Hey my name is Joe and i´m 21 years old and i´l think i´l would compliment the summer camp very good, because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak. They sit there like lumps. Maintaing cars are expensive.Public transport you do not need to worry about any petrol filling, checking tyre pressures, getting tired after driving long journey.In future cutting down public transport affects many of the people.Elderly people wont able to drive always depends on public transport.If public transport stop services people who are not able to drive will  affect a lot. Computers defenetly have positive effect on people because they feed you a constant stream of knowlage, they develop good hand eye coordination, and they enable the people who use them to communicate with others. Clearly, they are a positive addition to our world. To begin, computers bring you constant a stream of knowlage. So for finish competition with pleasure I needed work out plan witch is diary day by day about our jogging distance, time, mood during work out. She simply grab her computer, and the information is delivered to her with the click of a button. @CAPS5 she didn’t have a computer sheld never obtain such knowlage. Second, in a survey of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of total computer usage is looking up information, and gaining knowlage. This statistic shows that computers defenetly help them when looking for information. Also a recent @ORGANIZATION3 article on computer usage states that @CAPS5 people didnt have computers, half of the world’s discoveries would not be around today. You can tell that the amount of knowlage that computers give us is very important! people that they play in this categorie are fameous althoug you can see them on tv.if you want to be a big football player you must to practise more time and yoor life should to be healthy. Children’s specialist @PERSON3 says, “@CAPS4 need to be able to play video games, even though they are usually discouraged on the computer. They build fantastic hand eye coordination, and help with many things including @ORGANIZATION1 & sports.” @CAPS5 there were no computers, this hand eye coordination could never developed! Also, at @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, they limited computer use, and as a result of it, the sports teams there all got losing records. Could this be because of the lack of hand eye coordination of those students? Additionally, at @ORGANIZATION1, after a recent survey, it was discovered that @NUM1 students who play video games on their computers do better in gym class because of the added hand eye coordination. Clearly computers greatly build hand eye coordination. Lastly, using computer allows people to communicate with each other through email & other social networks. In addition, stress is a clear disadvantage of compete because competitiors are trying to win and this can frustrates.But, some people do not think this like this and take it more simply Finally, I think that to compete in sports has some benefits and disadvantages, but when is controlated there are some benefits that help you to whole you life. @CAPS6.com, we have discovered that millions of users use the computer & @CAPS6 to communicate everyday. If the public transport will be by higher quality, faster and fewer rates, majority of citizens will be prefer: is more calm to relax and read a newpaper or a magazine during the way in a collective transport than an indiivdual one; moreover, the time spend up to go and came back will be reduced, because it promotes less car in the railway. Secondly, a friend of mine, @PERSON2, who goes to @ORGANIZATION4, says that the main way that she communicates with her friends & makes plans with them is by computer. @CAPS5 she didn’t have one, none of this could be done. Furthermore, a recent article by @PERSON4 a teen specialist at @ORGANIZATION5 says that when people don’t have computers & can’t communicate or talk to the outside world, they are more prone to diseases & sickness like depression or anorexia. When they don’t talk as much with their friends, these sicknesses are more prone to occur. This defenetly shows that communicating with computers is very important. Now, @CAPS1 this. But a good change of our habit is attention to calery food and healthy food because of get information on internet and another media that are accessible way for all people easily these days. One of the boys calls out, “hey, look at his “ and the rest of his family rushes to his side. Their faces aglow with this @ORGANIZATION3 information. You can see that computers have a positive effect on people because they bring @ORGANIZATION3 information, they build hand eye coordination, and they allow you to communicate with others. So, computer specialists, what are you waiting for? Go to your computers right now & learn some @ORGANIZATION3 things!"	4

"You should knew about the prize for coming to the museum is very cheap ($15.00) for hour if you want to stay more time the prize increase in $10.00. The social networks such as: Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,Google plus... are connecting  us to more and more friends, companies, public figures, books, films, social organizations...we are really have many things to see, to think, to ""like"", to ""comment"" and a dozen of stuffs that we can make an action to interactive with others...so may it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves, to take care our healthy. As for myself I am one of those on the side of which is for computers. I think the do alot less harm than good. First of all the hand-eye cordination of the user is mostly improved over a period of time, which helps withe learning musical instruments. Also it gives a great learning ability to people, particularly student. If there were computers, for a student to do a report he/she would have to read through an encyclopedia, which takes a great amount more time than plainly looking it up on the internet. Finaly computers are great for communicating with far-away friends or family. Travelling by car is convenient but there are dis advantage as well.As our population growing fast in a family both husband and wife working and children at university able to drive, so you are looking per house least 3 cars, so imagine how busy our roads will be.As now fuel price coming down that does not mean that it will stay like that for ever, price go up and down. These skills are the ability to work with your hand and eyes simultaniously. There is a number of impacts these skills can make. Michael went into the teacher office,but he found that his teacher isn't here,maybe teacher went to the bathroom,suddenly,the door is opened by teacher,a teacher who wore bikini came into sight,this incident came as quite a surprise to Michael,she flirted with Michael,Michael felt excited but run out of the office,but he had regret for his action,Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. If you are trying to learn a new song to be played on guitar you must move your fingers to the notes coresponding with the screen. Another place where hand-eye cordination comes in handy is sports. One sport where hand eye cordination makes a huge impact is in football. If the ball is thrown then the wide recever must watch the ball with his eyes and make sure he puts his hands in the best position to catch the ball. I am also going to argue the vost world of learning that is provided by computers. Lets just say someone asks you who was the @NUM1 president of the @ORGANIZATION2 where would you go to find that answer? I don't know about you but I am definatley going to look it up on google (internet search engine). Also schools @CAPS1 can ask alot more of their students because they have all this information at there desposal. Lastly I would like to cover the communications abilitys that the computer puts out there. First of all let say you have a very close friend move out-of-state"" how are you going to keep in touch. You could try using phones but yet the long-distance fees have sky-rocketed over the past @NUM2 years. Did you know that if you talk long distance for @NUM3 mins a day that would be over @NUM4 a month. in todays ecconmy you need to save money not talk it all away. The internet charges no additional fees for chatting no matter how far away you are from each-other. So hopefully my letter will be able to surposs ""@CAPS2'bama's failed health care bill"" to at least make it somewhere in the paper. People need to know the facts about computers before they try to argue about them."""	4
535	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Despite of the fact that smoking does harm to health, as is known by almost everyone, there are still many people keep smoking everyday. They often light a cigratte at any place they like, especially in public situation, such as restaurants and so on. I feel really uncomfortable while a person is smoking close to me. i like volei because it was part of my life and of life of my mother, is my favorite sport, but i like over sports too, same i don't play volei because I'm bad, and my friends that know, don't like of  peoples bad of volei.I'm watching they playing, they're really very good, but when play over school, they're very bad The reasons are as follows. First of all, as is mentioned above, smoking is really harmful to smokers' health and people around them as well. A number of research reports indicate that a heavy smoking is likely to lead to a lung cancer which is a deadly disease for human beings. Online Lerning Positiv things about the online lernign are dat you are more mobile with your smartphone and you dont have to carry so much paper with you, also your on your own and in your own lerning speed what makes it more spesific on the user it selfs. What's more, if there is no one smoking at restaurants, other customers can enjoy a meal with pleasure in a comfortable environment. In this way, customers may feel relaxed and have a good appetite, which will stimulate the income of restaurants. Neverthless, if some smokers can't bear this rule, we can set up a smoking room for them to smoke. This room must be sealed in case other customers will be troubled by it. These are my general ideas of banning smoking at all restaurants in the country. I can draw a safe conclusion that this decision will bring us more good than harm, so we can appeal to our friends to support it."	4

"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1 are you adminitrating your loacl newapaper to society? You are probably using a computer to type the documents. If the government, businesses, schools, students and local newspaper are using computers for a variety of different tasks then @CAPS1 are thet not helpful? Primarily, computers are used for typing, editing and presenting as stated before, local newpaper are required to use computers to present their work. I am beleving that there is no future for the public transpot, using trains is mor convient and low expenses also to decrease the carpon gases which affecting the ozone, people should be aware about the effect of using the public transpotation on the econmics and enviroment, goverements shall encarge the people to use the other ways for transport, this subject shall be issuesd in all media to learn and encrage the people to use he wrigth way for transpot. The govermnet must announce laws to the people and use typed documents to communicate with different countries & states. Without computers signs, flyers, bussinesses, and even newspapers would not be possible. You are running late to work able to traffic on the hignway. @CAPS1 are you supposed to explain to your boss in time? You can simply email him the situation and arrive stress-free to work. Prctically the entire world uses computers as a source of communication, so why be indifferent? Computers make life easier for people through communication like email, social network websites such as facebook and aol, and even video chat. Computers supply an excellent source of communication that is even used throughout schools. Teachers and administrater interact with each other with important message using computers. Following your letter , I want to tell you about The apartment is very Beautiful not big or small medium-sized left inside two rooms, a bathroom and a dining hall and an external director categorize overlooking a beautiful view I am sure he will like it  to come and Tri condo b soon ,n the end, I would say that I miss you too much and I hope to see you soon. As a western middle school students, I know the amount of projects and research we are required to do per class. Without the internet this would almost be impossible. The internet allows research to happen. Most of the organizations known how is affect managemant acountant practice on them work , therefore they are chossing good programme and employee. one day Michael decided to make a surprise party to sinha to make her happy and feel his love more so he arranged everything and to keep it surprise to her he was busy all the time and did not show off all the week as usual .that make sinha worried and suspect that Michael do not love her any more and know another girl and she become extremely sad and even it become worse when Michael asked her to go to his apartment to make  the surprise to her  but he did not answer his phone after that . To conclusion, I feel that computers are an excellent advance in technology and should be used as frequently as possiblr. Without them, newspaper could not print, teachers could not communiacte, and students couldn't complete tasks for school. As a student I know they help me with school and communicating with my friends and relatives. If computer are such a helpful source to society, why would people consider them as a concern?"	4
537	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"The desire of supporting oneself is luring more and more college students to take part-time jobs out of school, which has gradually become a fashion throughout campus. Young people at this age have the needs of proving that they are mature enough and can live on their own. However, when more college students are stepping out of the campus looking for real life, they don't realize that the temptations outside, the damage to their imagination and the time and energy they have devoted may actually jeopardize their mind. One of the disadvantages of taking part-time jobs in college years is that students may be tempted by the material world. Different from campus life where everyone is the same, people are divided into different levels in real world. College students, being some what ego and ambitious, would soon be tempted by power and social status and forget that they are still students. One thousand people by eighteen and more are questions in my town about their way takes care of the environment.Investigation reveals the youngsters are more than ever power to  save the world from waste and pollution. One possible result is that students won't be able to sit in the classroom and focus on their subjects any more not to say spending years doing their researches. Also, taking part-time jobs would form students into being realistic and take away students' imagination. While college students are dreaming of developing new technology and changing the world, business people in the society are caring about how many profits they can make out of the investment. i like volei because it was part of my life and of life of my mother, is my favorite sport, but i like over sports too, same i don't play volei because I'm bad, and my friends that know, don't like of  peoples bad of volei.I'm watching they playing, they're really very good, but when play over school, they're very bad Gradually, their imaginations would be damaged. Then, we only have a bunch of engineers in stead of scientists. After all, students' priority is studying. Since taking part-time job may mess with students' mind, ruin students' imagination and take out students' time and energy, students should not take the risk. Jobs will always be there. College students do not need to be in a hurry."	4

"Dear local newspaper, I'm sure you love kicking back and surfing the web. Afterall, the internet is an amazing invention. However, the truth of the matter is that some people spend way to much time on the computer. But, on the other hand, because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable; cars are so many; very noisy, unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth. Excessive use of the internet can lead to not enough exercise. It can cause us to be anti-social, And lastly, not allow us to enjoy the beautiful nature that surrounds us. Do you know that a very high cause of obesity is? Electronics, kids sit on the computer all day long, while they should be out exercising and keeping fit. Sure, it is still okay to surf the web. You just have to keep the time minimum we could ensure this rule by having a time limit set at home. I myself love to use the computer, but i make sure to get off after about an hour. The whole idea of the ""internet"" is such a broad topic. As well, we have to promote that the people get jobs close their accommodation or get the accommodation close to the jobs, because we have too much pollution and we could reward the companies that hire staff close to the place of job, maybe in a circle of 4 kilometres, as well we could reward the people that turn their accommodation for live near to the job or for going  there by a bicycle. There are so many forms of chat on the internet; @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, etc. Many people are always on one of those, instead of talking in person. We can eventually become anti-social due to so much time spent on the computer. Although yes, you can be talking over the internet, it is necessary to be talking to people face to face, it is as if we become grued to the computer. when i ran with the ball, i feel that i hold a goal or a valuable something and i should offer my best to put it in his place and make it in right way  . People get addicted and are on them constantly, @CAPS4 ""@CAPS5"" websites actually take away time that could be spent with friends. So instead of having a chat over the computer screen, plan a meeting in person. Don't allow the computer to let you loose the social skills that you have built up. Travelling by car is much more convenient but all know really there is no future for public transport.When we talk about public transport,there are many people and everyone travel but i think we do not feel relax are there and if we talk about travelling by car.It is the best or much more convenient for us.Because we can travel any where but in public transport we can not travel to any other sites There are so many thing that you would be missing out on. Take time out of you day that you would normally spend on the computer to take a walk outside. Elizabeth apparent to be a very sweet girl, but Jason is not convince, because when he kiss her, he doesn’t feel nothing, he doesn’t feel that gravity disappear, and when his face turn red, he just put a face of horror and surprise , like if she was very sorry about kissing him. once you cut down you computer time littyle-by-little, you will realize all the other things that are more worth you time. So the next time you think about going to surf the web or play that new computer game, i hope you think about my opinions i presented to you. Too much time on the computer causes us to not get enough exercise, and we can become anti-social. we won't be able to enjoy the nature around us. Computer time is fine in moderation, you just have to be aware of how much time you spend on it. Hopefully, my supported reasons have given you another view on surfing the web."	4

"You say that computers are bad on todays society? @CAPS1 I'm here to prove you wrong and tell you that they can actually benefit todays society. Maybe some kids don't have phones, so they can go log onto facebook and do everything a phone has to offer and more. School. School. School; so many homework assignments and projects are assigned, and using computer programs help alot and give that proffesional touch. The first two step is to design with background color artwork and security issues and prepare metal plates with skilled machinists.Then there are some requirments for printing sheets:color on both sides, special ink and images slightly raised.The most essential and key process is manual inspections for printed sheets with three categories: good quality sheets, patially damaged sheets and bad sheets. So computers bad for society, think again and listen closely. blc computers have just benifited us more than ever. www.facebook.com, that is one of the most visited pages on the internet for all different ages, it deffinetly benefits you. Logging on and seeing your friends profile's newest updates on pictures, videos and life, you get every little detail using facebook. And I you don't have a phone, no. wornes, facebook has a chat system, so you and friends and relatives can talk, or maybe theirs a family party comingup you can get inboxed on all the information, and visit the relatives homepage and see how theyve been doing. @CAPS3 you haven't logged into facebook yet, you deffinetly will now! ""This project will be done on the computer,"" how many times do you hear a teacher says that, almost everytime youre given an assignement! @CAPS1 windows and @ORGANIZATION1 programs will really benefit you in your need for school help. Lets say you've been assigned a project to create a product commerical in computer class, you can hop right onto windows movie maker and get all the help you need, and you'll have the ability to create you project right on the program so it looks and sounds professional. One program you can always use throughout life for presentation is 'power ', In my history class we were assigned a famous person from the @DATE1's and were to do a presentation; @CAPS1 when I got my assignment I went right to powerpoint and got a great grade! lastly the known, @ORGANIZATION1 word! used for all kinds of projects or homeworks and espically writing papers or short stories, having spell check, youre garenteed a good grade! Google! Everyone knows it and everyone loves it. This web hit canbe used for just about anything. The people of my town try to plant plants in the centre or somewhere is too smoke, so they try to keep the air at recommended levels.on the morning a lot of people go on footto the work or to the school or ride a bike or they take the bus.The people try to move the local factories out of country where is less air polluted ,less smoke,less cars and more forests and plants. Michael decided to open the door and back for her, he thought better the things he do not want to leave her again, he like her, he knows himself and he wants to know her, he have kept all his feelings for a long time. my town tries all the time to make our town more beautiful and comfortable by taking more care of the environment,they provide us by good buses which are friends to the environment and offer the tickets for this buses in a cheap price,they also trying to find the best way to make the rubbish more useful by the recycling,also the people tries all the time to find the best way for keep our village clean;they never throw the rubbish in the streets or the gardens,also they take care of the fuel in their cars to not to be bad for the environment,so,it's our duty to take care of our village and the whole environment beside the government. ""Have you change your mind? have you listened closely?"" @CAPS3 so your life just become a whole lot easier, by using facebook, for social ability, @ORGANIZATION1 and windows programs for school, and google for life and health, you have just benefitted from my writing and from using modern technology, the computer!"	4

"Also 'internet' in our days helps to get information all over the world, and if you wish to get involved then go to the www.bbc.co.uk.These sites are free way to find most adequate information about actual events both in society and technical life. In my opinion, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people. For instance, it's not safe and children can get into all sorts of things on the internet. Also, people spend too much time in front the computer now a days, @CAPS1, its a major distraction and also a negetive effect on kids. school work. It's now or never! Do we dicide that computers have a negetive effect? You decide! Isn't every parents biggest concern the safety of their children? When on the internet, kids are capable of accessing anything and everything. Sometimes kids don't even look for bad things, they just pop up. Would you want your child veiwing things that you have no control over? Also, websites like @CAPS2.com one one of the greatest concerns when it comes to internet safety. Although you are supposed to be at least @NUM1 to have a @CAPS2, most kids lie about their age. Did you know that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 @CAPS2 users lie about their age? And it's not always a @NUM4 year old saying they are @NUM1, it could be a @NUM6 year old saying they're @NUM7! Not only do people lie about their age, they lie about who they are.

In other way, I never be a witness , what I have to do?, tell me what cain of suit have the witnees have to wear, If I have to buyany colour of tie, the flower.... really I'm very exciting with your wedding. It's a gorgeous @DATE1 day. Bright blue skies, cotton candy cloulds, the sun is shining, and there's a nice warm breece. Perfect day to go out and get active, right? Wrong! None people would @CAPS5 be inside on the computer. Instead of going for a walk, people would @CAPS5 spend hours on facebook. Nowadays a person's worth seems to be judge  according to the social status and material possessions, that is mostly to happen in high class famiies, as they are foccus on achievements as power, political influences etc. So my idea is aii the coutries allthe people stop to use farmland,forest andwetlang to build houses grow more trees portect our world,our homestar! Instead of playing video games onlin, people need to be reminded that turning off the computer and playing a fun beighborhood game of baseball is just as fun and much more beneficial. This is just one step @CAPS3 need to take to get a healthier lifestyle. Wouldn't you agree? Did you know that kids that spend more time on computer are more likely to do poorly in school? i don't know my name .i don't know my age all i know about that i want to be a great woman ,i want the world to hear my voice , to prove that i can do it  i can do any thing  i am not weak i have woman power As a student, I will admit that the computer is a very tempting distraction and can easily pull a student away from their studies. You can't expect a child to make the right decision and tell their they have to go because they need to study. So you do! For another,there are many different types of programs,which can broaden our eyes,they give details of education,plus other meaningful information，such as documentaries，talk show and so on.These programs are not just for killing the time,but for educating. The time has come to decide. Do you believe Computers have a negative effect on people? It's clear that the computer is not safe. Not to mention, too much time is spent on the computer instead of being active. Suddenly we heard the sound of running footsteps.Then there was a cry and the footsteps stopped.Nervously,we walked back.Perhaps someone had been killed,or kidnapped in the street We were going to see what happened ,and we had something to see.There was one old granny who was beat up.We try to gave her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that.Than we were trying to find help ,but nobody was opening doors.On our luck I had a mobile phone ,but Michael was saying that we need to escape because we did not know are those bullies near the corner.My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I've done that. Don't wait another minute! Good day, My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport, Volleyball one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to practise  this sport 3 times a week since 1980,  the reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as follows : 1- make me fit and healthy  2- classy game no friction between players  3- it exercise all muscles of your body Regarding the above I advice all rookies to start practise this sport and they will get many benefits."	4
541	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"I think there are several reasons it is important for university students to get a part-time job, and I outline two of them below. The first is that part-time jobs are a valuable way to see how what students have learnt in class applies in the real world. Classroom education, especially at the university level, tends to be academic and theory-oriented. There is often little opportunity to see how these theories apply in practical usage. A part-time job in the same field as the student's degree will allow them to learn from professionals who apply these concepts on a daily basis. This will be a useful contrast from university classes, which are almost always taught by researchers. The second benefit of obtaining part-time employment alongside higher education is that it gives the student opportunities to pick up skills that they will need later when they enter the workforce, but are not taught in traditional university curricula. My advice of finding work, is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work.But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase. University education is primarily designed to test whether the theoretical concepts taught have been learnt with sufficient clarity. When students enter the workforce, however, they often need to apply these concepts in concert with their colleagues. This will require them to communicate effectively and clearly.

"I think that the advances of technology to the computer are great and more beneficial than bad. Say you struggle at school and need serious help, you can turn to a computer for help, say you have a dear friends that a week ago moved to florida, you can use the computer to contact them. I have confessed that in the first time I didn´t like it very much because I was a bit shy boy and I cost a lot of effort to integrate with the other players of the team but with the passage of the time I liked more and more. this country are many interesting pLaces to visit,if you wantto have adventure you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza.If you want to have fun you may go to parque de la Costa there are many interesting rolercoasters.And if you want to go the best museum of art in Argentina you should go to malba. These are just a few reasons why the computer is helpful as opposed to bad! School one of many students least favorite activities, yet you can use the internet to help you out, @CAPS1! say you are in geometry and it is kicking you're butt, got to @PERSON1 academy for informational videos. Maybe you are a third grade teacher and the little kids are driving you nuts, go to @LOCATION1, and educational and fun website. Maybe you just want to relax and learn, plug in earphones and listen to math help. These are merely a few ways that the internet helps with schooling. What if it is a really rainy rainy day and you are tired and want to learn about faraway places in a logical person's head, the internet pops into their head. Think of the computer as a big easy to acess library, type something into a search engine and it pops up. What if you are in germany and you are hungry, oh no! Everything is in @CAPS2! open your laptop for easy translation. All of these things support that the internet makes learning about foreign places easy. last summer i worked at cinema.i think it is a very good job because you can see any films you like for free.The minus of this work is very big salary and i think that i will work at this cinema on the next summer. internet's middle name is communication. What if your phone is gone and there is an emergency, you can get the email! What if a burgalor cuts the phone lines and sneaking your house e-mail @NUM1. When anyone miss to pass the ball or miss scored a goal we shouting on his face are you crazy how you missed this goal ! Those are some of the reasons the internet is good for communication. Someone was calling the door while that someone was stealing in your house... By that, her sister is scared and woke up...  Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake Internet is great for communication. Also help with learning about far away places. And finally help with schooling. These are the reasons I think internet is valuable in this day in age."	4
543	Government: Some people think that governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology. Other people disagree and think that this money should be spent on more basic needs. Which of these opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"In modern society, many governments in countries are struggling with where to spend money. Since the money is finite, the topic of how much to distribute it is inevitable, so it is also sensitive but important. In my opinion, the money should be spent on more basic needs, rather than on developing or buying computer technology, for some reasons. You can visit old city and watch old buildings and castel,you can watch the beautiful view from bridges over the water.Young people may like to take a walk in king garden,there is sakura trees.If you like night life you can go to some bars and night clubs that are open till morning.But there are two places that i meant in the beggining,its a big zoo called Kolmorden and biggest aquapark in Scandinavia that called Rusha. When the investments for basic fields are fulfilled, the country will have potential to more develop on these fields; furthermore, they have greater potential even on the actual field. That is, it is no exaggeration to say that many theories on actual came from basics. For example, mathematics and physics are the most basic disciplines in electronic or mechanical studies. In addition, it is because they are not at the same level as salaries or research support costs for people in the practical. Even in South Korea, investment in engineering colleges with outstanding results is sufficient. On the contrary, there is a shortage of personnel due to the lack of labor and support costs in pure science. Some may think that it uncertain to invest much to basic fields. However, there will be no future for the country if the government pays attention to the visible investment. In conclusion, there is a need to invest in pure scholarship as much as or more than the cost of practical studies. Many may have felt that applying without the basics unsettled is not correct."	4

"Computers are an incredibly important part of many peoples lifestyles. They can give us wonderful facts and news that would otherwise be hard to obtain. Abortion is an immoral act that people make as everyone has a chance to survive and nobody has the right to decide for anyone life.Abortion has to be taken seriously in order to avoid these immoral action as these fetus are being deprive of their right since they have already a life.People had to be sensitize about abortion in order to decrease the number of women being abort.Furthermore,abortion is very dangerous and a great number of women had been death with this.Children has to be protected before and after life,it is why abortion has to be stop One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance,  homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society. One of the most beneficial parts of computers is that you can find out whats happening anywhere in the world. For instance, I could do a search engine on recent disaters and find hundreds of articles on @CAPS1 and other recent news. However you could also find out interesting facts like how many have chosen to sail around the world in the past ten years. But this is just one of the many uses a computer has. n the town he tries that the people have to aware about the sitiations and they take care  the environment   On the other hand, the ask is if this solution could be enough or no. But computers can actually do the opposite. There are many websites that allow you to talk safely to people. Some of those websites are facebook and chatme.com. Did you know that you can even video chat with people. It's just like youre right there with you. Incredibly, unlike calling people and using a phone using these websites is free and open to anyone. This brings me to the last point. Computers are great writing tools. They allow you to write efficiently and neatly. Also, programs liek microsoft word allow you to spell check your work. However one of the most usefull qualitus of a program like word is that it allows you to change your work and add sentences or words wherever you want. Its you can see computers are a usefull and beneficial part of society. They allow people to easily stay informed on world news. Secondly computers allow easy and safe communication between people and lastly they are usefull for writing papers such as writing prompts. I hope that by reading this, you can now see some of the many uses of computers."	4

"Today, wherever you go, there is technology being used. The most common, computers are widely used by a majority of people, but are computers really beneficial to society? Everyone eagerly waiting for the ambulance arrival but still not yet reached the reason is our college location is little far from the city that's why it is getting late. Computers are beneficial because they help people connect with the world. You can use a computer to find anything that is on the web, so you can find information about places that interest you or places that you would like to visit. According to the @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people check the internet for places to @ORGANIZATION1 to before they actually go. @CAPS1, it is a way to connect with faraway friends. One of my friends moved to @LOCATION1 when we were in @NUM3 grade, but we still e-mail each other, and are still friends. The computer is @CAPS1 one of the fastest ways you can learn about current events. All you have to do is go to a news website. All of these connections will widen people's views of the world. Computers are a way to increase responsibility, too. Nowadays, the transportation become more prefect,and the people'life become more convenient.Althought this change lend the life of people efficient,the problem should not be ignored.It would really be helpful if the government make tighter resrictions,in today's world ,lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission, they are destroyed the forest,farmland and wetland,charging waster water and emitting greenhouse gas,it lead to a serious enviorment problem.So the government should oversee this companies ,and if companies do not obey the rules or laws ,it will be fined and closed. Having these individual chances will help people think of what the right choice is. Even if you choose the wrong choice, you will learn from your mistake. it can never be regained even the strongest monarchs have been helpless to prevent time.So should be careful about the importance of time .I hope to not waste it and use it as the best use for giving opportunity for rising .Those who waste it ,will be behind and they will fail to make a mark in their life.The great men and successful guys became fame and rose by a suitable use for time .They guide and source of inspiration for a new generation. i was at this team for 5 years and the made me even better in football.I played my first match at 16 years old and i felled very special because i was 16 and i was capable of putting 3 goals. Thinking of this and making sure not to damage the computer are ways to increase responsibility. Lastly, computers are beneficial because they help education. Teachers can use the computer to make lessons more interesting. Good Morning: This is an esay about my favourite sport,it is swimming since I was a child because always enjoy a lot and what is more I can do it alone, I never refuse to go swimming pool and less in summer, of course. @CAPS1, you can make for the students, which provide them with their homework and information about the classes one of my friends once said ""@CAPS2 the I would definitely be failing"". Nobody wants to talk and a great way to present this. Lastly, if you want information on a particular school, you can just search it online and find its website. School websites have information about classes, events, and clubs. They provide the information that you need to think about going to that school in an easy, convenient way, while finding the website for the school take no more than @NUM2 minutes, actually going to that school for information can take more than just @NUM2 minutes, and even hours. According to @ORGANIZATION2, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students choose what college to go to first by checking its website. The computer is an easy, convenient way to get information. Now, no one should be doubting the benefits of a computer. They are a connection to the world, like places, and people. They increase responsibility by giving you many choices. They help education by providing information about and for schools. This is why computers are beneficial to the society."	4

Science fiction, thriller, romance, how to build a car with household materials and many more topics all await you at your nearest bookstore or library. With this vast array of topics it isn't that surprising that you will find some authors that have decided to go against the norms of society and write a book that is controversial in the ideas that it presents. These books will often get put on a 'burn list' or censorship list and will be taken off the shelves of the local libraries in order to protect the patrons of those institutions from those books' ideas. Many have argued that this is a way of keeping the society pure, but this censorship of literary works is probably one of the biggest mistakes a civilization can make. Removing books from the shelves off a library is a form of censorship, which is a clear violation of the @CAPS1. In the @LOCATION1, everyone has certain unalienable rights. These were written out in our @CAPS1 as the first ten admendments to the @CAPS1. One of those rights is the freedom of speech, or the right to voice your opinion. By remving a book from the shelf of a library, you are silencing the author of that book and thus taking away that author's freedom of speech. This clearly violates the @CAPS1 and thus is unconstitutional and illegal in the @LOCATION1. By violating the @CAPS1 openly, this opens the door for other areas to be violated in the @CAPS1. The president is now a dictator, we are now a communist country, and many other actions are allowed, leaving the @CAPS1 as a scrap of paper with no meaning. Without the @CAPS1, the @LOCATION1 is just like any other country and has no direction. This leads to a downward spiral of our society. The silencing of the voices of authors also stops new ideas from coming in to a society. Every year thousands of new books are introduced to the @CAPS8 public. Many of these have novel ideas that help shape our society for the future. If you take these books off the shelves, and out of the publics hands, you effectivly stop all change from new ideas in a society. And the strengths and weaknesses in both of segmental and suprasegmental, I think it’s maybe the learning habit, when I heard a sentences, I would use many varieties of tone and manner to say the sentences again, therefore,I can easily be interpreted illustrations instructions the emotions and feelings. Mohammed is a kindly prophet born in small city called mekka and travelled to another city closed to mekka called almadina cause the people of mekka were very aggressive and they not accepted the new Invitation for the new religio Mohammed came back to his town mekka after that and forgave the people of mekka whose abused him In the novel '@CAPS9 @NUM1' by @PERSON1, the censorship of books has gone so far that all the great literary works of the world are banned. Anyone who is caught reading a book that 'makes the think' locked up or killed. The main characters job as a fireman is not to put out fires, but to set books on fire that encourage people to think. The censorship of that society had gone so far that no one did anything, they just sat at home and watched the television all day. Many people will argue that pornography is something that should be censored out of society, but the problem is once you start censoring, where do you stop? for carreer has 80% under 26 years old students are taken it, for the age over 49 years old only has 20%people are taken; but if you counper interest, it is totoly different; for under 26 years old have only 10%; but for over 49 years old it has 70%. Some people say that a tripp by car is more convenient that by the public transportation, but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations.It is true that travel to a nearby place from your city, it  is more comfortable getting there by car, and the ease of have your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time paying  cabs. That is why censorsip can quickly lead to the collapse of a society. Although censorship @MONTH1 seem like a good idea, it is really one of the largest mistakes a society can make. It can lead to the silencing of all the voices of change in a society causing society to grind to halt and stay right were it is. Not only is it determental to a society but it is also is clearly unconstitutional if you look at the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1. So let us hope that all though we @MONTH1 play with the idea of censorship, that we never go down that winding road to no where"	4

"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there is an ongoing debate about the issue stating that not everyone agrees that computers benefit society. I can't understand why. Computers present many oppurtunities for people. One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance,  homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society. This is why I agree that computers do benefit society. In the modern world, nearly all businesses rely on communication. Many people in those businesses use not only phones to communicate, but computers as well. Online communication is a fast, simple, and effective way for people to communicate whether @CAPS1 is at home or at work. This is one way computers benefit all of society. Nobody knows everything, we are always trying to find out about new things that we neven knew. Sometimes we @MONTH1 use books, but the way most people use is online researching. This is because not only is @CAPS1 quicker, but simpler as well. When you research online, the information literally comes to you. All you do is type a subject to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is another reason why computers do benefit society. The final reason is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. Pass some years  of the university and he know a girl called Kate and he get loved on here and she get loved in him. @CAPS1 might take a while, but over time people get the hang. @CAPS1's as @CAPS1 the computer is letting you teach yourself. Another example of why lives are gonna changed completely in 50 years is because also that connection between others cultures make People concern more about her own health, the expectations of life and the way they want to live it, because everyday will be easier to see how much are we hearting the earth so we will see faster the impacts that this brings to our life. Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath...deep one and started to dive . In conclusion, you can see that I have clearly stated the benefits of computers. They allow us to communicate, research, and improve our hand-eye coordination. This is why computers do benefit society."	4
548	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Specializing Subjects in Universities
Introduction:
             It has been controversial in many universities nowadays if they should make students specifically study one subject or experience many subjects throughout university life. Even though there are some advantages having experience in various field, it is better to focus study on one subject because of the efficiency. First of all, it is better for student to invest their study on one particular subject because the subject itself became more complicated as the higher course is taken. Moreover, the time that students get to learn is limited. Thus, it will be better for students ti focus at one particular subject. As an example, to know about chemistry department in general, knowing the organic compounds that is taught in basic mandatory classes is not enough to understand the essential of chemistry. Secondly, do more cooperation between countries.To illustrate, people should cooperation To intervene to bring peace to the world to stop the war in many areas like what United Nations doing.For example, United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy . Secondly, focusing on one subject put a real meaning on degree that is given to students. As stated before that each subject has different depths;  so, the more higher courses students take, the more complexity the class would offer. As an example, if someone would majored in chemical engineering but during their study, they study other field which decrease the opportunity to focus on particular subject. Rather than jumping out on subjects that only cover the subject on the surface, it is better to go deeper in particular subject. From the beginning of the world till now , human wants the fast income and the easy ways of live , so he tries more and more to find a solution for  his problems by creating a new ways of liveing more easy and more convenient  for him. Lastly, it is better to know a field professionally rather than a surface knowledge of many subjects. As an example, a 
            Some might argue that mandating students to choose only one subject might reduce the opportunity of learning new subjects. But we don't have forgotten the cotamination by cars, We can use more the bicycle or public transportetion.

549	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"I agree that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years First of all, more likely to develop cancer. To human cancer, we are experiencing now 30-40 percent of the cancers caused by tobacco. At least 20 kinds of cigarettes inside the Level A may contain carcinogens. The accumulation of carcinogens in tobacco smoke continuously for long periods depend on the type of cancer greatly increases the probability of occurrence of cancer. Currently we are experiencing mankind 30-40% of cancer is caused by a cigarette. Therefore, if the world did not smoke 30-40% of all cancers would not have occurred. And Second reason is another disease. Leads to respiratory diseases. Cigarette smoking and respiratory function continued to weaken. Continue to smoke cigarettes to stimulate primary airway inflammation and cough up phlegm and bronchial wall thickening, creates a narrowing of bronchial as weakens the respiratory function. I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens.So I do not agree with this afirmation, in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport. So who smoked cigarettes for a long time that deep mucus remained above lung strange sounds. As these reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."	4

"Some ""experts"" are warned that people should spend too much time on their computers. Yet, look at all of the advantages to a computer. You can develop better hand-eye coordination skills, internet with friends/family who could live hundreds of miles away, and you can learn about cultures all around the world, along with the people who live in those countries, without ever leaving home. In my oponion, computers overall benefit society, helping us learn more & more every day. First off, there are many skills you can develop on the computer. For example, when playing interactive high-paced games, kids get a sense of awareness timing, and hand-eye coordination. Not to mention, with new advances in technology, people can now go to college without ever leaving home, and at a much lower price, while still getting a great education. Many people even work from home, thanks to their computers. These are still only a few of the many skills that can be learned on computers. yes, i agree, if you planed the travelling for a long distation and for a long time you would prefer to do it on car, couse firstly you;ll spend less time, you travelling will be comfortable, you'll have a possibility to stop every where and for a long time, as you need. At first, I had called a travel agent but he said he couldn’t be able to book me a flight before two months, so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent. You can go online, look up some of that countries recipes, language, pictures, people without the hassel of going there. Not to mention, for kids who aren't old enough to @LOCATION1, or have to do a report on it, instead of making through countless textbooks, newspapers, libraries in general, they go online, @CAPS1 their country, and they have must, if not all the info they need right there. So not only is getting the information then you would've learned in the first place, thereby, extending your knowledge. Finally, the internet helps people connect. First I will ask a question to you if this is your own house,you buy it with a lot of money and will you broke it with no reason? For example, if you have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, you could both buy cameras for your computer, install them, and within minutes, be seeing each other/talking face to face. I think this is better then simply writing letters to them, as it's quicker, and you get to connect more. Same goes if a friend or you move away, but want to stay in touch. A quick facebook account or @ORGANIZATION1, and you'll still be good friends. So all in all, yes, computers do benefit society, as they help teach people skills, learn about distant cultures/far away countries, and connect people, who might live in different countries. I don't see anything wrong with these beneficial factors to society. So yes, computers have a positive effect on people."	4

"In third grade, I took a book off the shelf of my local library that had an interesting cover. It was rather large, but I had come to love reading in that time of my life so I decided I was up for it. The genre of the book was fantasy which I enjoyed immensly. Although, there were some parts of the book that had me confused. about my rest of family , as I said before they are just a relatives , but even if they are not friends almost ,but I do love them to much ,first one is my aunt ,the dead one ,and the other who still alive ,but i don't feel that felling of love towards my uncle , I do love him ,but he is just my uncle no more . Eventually, I came to ask my dad about a certain part of the book. He read the passage, and his eyes went wide. I never finished that book. There is no doubt that I had a learning experience by reading that book, but, as my dad obviously thought, it @MONTH1 have been a little too much for that time in my life. Fifty minutes passed ,when my body no longer was sore.I decided to walk to the end.Constantly,I just walked like without terminal contest.While I strugged to walk.Finally,I saw a light to appeare my eyes and I woke up. after two days poleas sow some boody in crime scene the poles man ask them what did you do hear ? There is simply some material that is not appropriate for children, and it should not be put in our public libraries. Not censoring what is put on the shelves seems obsurd considering my experience. If I have a son someday, I want to be the one telling him about the touchy subjects of women and swearing; it should not be from some fiction book. I also do not appreciate the other material found in our libraries. The music that I see has artists that write their songs without children in mind, movies have up to @NUM1 ratings, and magazines promote gossip and have sexual references. Overall, it is disappointing to me that our libraries have allowed some of these things onto their shelves. As I think about my experience in third grade, I wish I had never seen that book. Maybe it would have allowed me to keep a little more innocense for a little bit longer, and maybe I would have respected women more through my youth. According to the information donne, the most used is the car thus most of the families has one, but the public transportation is getting more and more common for those ones who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectfully with the planet."	4

"When you walk into the heavenly sanctuary that is our library, you have opened yourself up to a vast wealth of knowledge that is available to you at the click of a mouse, the push of a button, or the turn of a page. Also in the sort way, we should go walking to the destination.icle If we are working with  sameone in the same jobs, and  who lives near or he is our neighbour, we can go to the work in the same car, this way we use less oil. They feel it should be locked away, as if it were some eyesore. Allow me to address this view with retaliation and distaste on a number of levels in the following document. I am a musician. Music is my passion. My creative gears are forever turning. for example, lunch time travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emission of carbon mono oxide which is effected to red blood cells and irritate to breathing system. How disappointed am I when I find that the music I want has been removed for being explicit. We can really confirm that there is no future for public transport, if so, we will have to drive a car instead of buying a ticket for public transport and go to office, city, home and so on using private transport, however we can also think that in the centre has no parking car or it is not enough for the whole private car, thereby, if we use a public transport, we can simplify our lives and spend less simply because we are able to save money and time. It does not do well to isolate media without first seeing the good that lies in it and the strong feelings it has to convey. We @MONTH1 discard the world's greatest novel because of racial discrepancies or wizardry. We @MONTH1 throw away a moving song because of its lyrics. We @MONTH1 trash a movie after only reading the title, never even giving it a chance. How fair is this? Even now there @MONTH1 be those who refuse to read your newspaper because of their disagreements with one, individual editor. That is no fair crop in my right mind. I implore you, as a public, as people of sound mind and stout hearts to reconsider the censorship of those works which have a clear and true message and were forged for the benefit of our humankind. All things have a story to tell. A friend of mine once said to me, that there were three ways we could absorb things that we find undesirable. We can reject, we can ignore, or we can absorb and interpret. To reject leaves you no smarter. To ignore leaves you in fear. However, to absorb, you gain new knowledge, be it of a new culture or new person. Everything must be taken with a grain of salt. Let us watch something we find immoral and then take the time to understand why it is immoral, for it is these things that define us. A few minutes ago,some boy who looks  like elderly than my old brother closed to the poor little boy,the little boy stopped cried,he looked on some boy,my brother felt afraid because they look like rube,but he still  wanted help the little boy. We need material of substance in our libraries, for our exposure and for our fathoming of new knowledge in our modern world"	4
553	Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"    People in early 20s feel confused because of the changes around them. They start to learn how to take responsibilities, how to work efficiently, and how to live without their parents. While this little chaos in their mind lasts, two groups, family and friends, will influence to the young. People often debate with the importance of each groups. I believe that friends are the most important influence on young adults. First of all, 20s spend more time for exciting and creative activities with their friends than with their families. Video games and sports are popular and common hobbies to men age of 20s. Obviously, their families can enjoy the games or play the sports. However, the absolute number of people who like to play the games or sports is deficient, so youngs can not fully enjoy the games only with their families. The first two step is to design with background color artwork and security issues and prepare metal plates with skilled machinists.Then there are some requirments for printing sheets:color on both sides, special ink and images slightly raised.The most essential and key process is manual inspections for printed sheets with three categories: good quality sheets, patially damaged sheets and bad sheets. Another important reason is that early 20s are also adults. They can think, decide on their own, and take responsibilities of their behaviors. This means they can choose the important influencers for their future. Egypt have more historical places such as pyramids is the one of empirical in the world and more people from around the wold come to see this pyramids the wold think how Egyptian people make this building from may be thousand year and still stand without change and more tourist come to take photo in the pyramids and study the stone and how the old Egyptian make this one without modern tools such as cranes and other modern machine more scientific teams come from all the world to study this building and make Egyptian science in more universities around the world to study how the air going inside this building and how it keep the food inside it and how this big stone takes out from far places and come for this place and how this building keep the body of the people after died and how this people leave inside the building and why this building like this and what the benefit of this building and how to make kike this building I believe that many people will also choose friends. Some people might say that young adults are completely dependent to their families in financial sides, so they are influenced more by their families. It is true that most of early 20s do not have enough abilities to earn money themselves. However,the family is near you since the day you were born until forever.The members follow you,and can based on them.You can tell whatever you want to them.For example,if you are in a bad mood the first person that will come next to you,to make you smile is your mom or dad.Mom and dad spent their life to grow up their children,to feed them,to love them! I like a car as well,but when I have to driving a car I have to think about parking a lot and I can't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am having travel,so the public transport is making connection with human beings.It is why I think public transport is really important for public and there are a lot of important thing is having a possble in the future. The way they will be grown up is decided by people who they will meet in the future, not in the past. So there are two big reasons why friends are the most important influencer to young adults. First one is the time usage, and second one is they are not just kids. I hope that people can change their views to early 20s; though early 20s are not fully grown up in physical, mental sides, they are also not kids."	4
554	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"My favourit sport is football i love it so much when i was young i used to watch football and my favorite team is Barcelona i was play with my friends at the street and we was happy with that so much and after that we played at playground like really football i love Cristiano Ronaldo so much he is the best player at the world a few people telling me that messi is the best player but i feel angry when i hear that because that is not true so i looking forward to meet my best player one day its like a dream to me . Computers are great for many reasons. Three of these reasons are pleasure, convienience, and education. I believe that these three reasons are the main reason we use computers today. One reason we use computers is for pleasure. On certain websites, you can talk to friends, see what your friends are doing, you can even video chat with them. Also, you can watch movies, @CAPS4 episodes, and videos. In addition, you can listen to music, play games, and check sports scores. I strongly beleive that pleasure is one of the main reasons we use computers today. Another reason why we use computers is convienience. Most people in @LOCATION1 have a computer in their home. Computers are convienient because you pay bills on the internet. You email co-workers about jobs. In addition, computers can help people create websites so their their buisness is more noticeable. As you can see, computers are a very convienient piece of technology. The final reason why we use computers is education. so, on my opinion, even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers The diabetes is the increasing  of the glucosa in the blood, The have two types, first the Diabetes Type 1 that is predent in childrens, pacient needs insuline every day, also this diabetes is caused by the destruction of the insuline realized by the person´s immuny siste. Computers can help you study, take notes, and helps do your homework. When I have a project, I always use the computer to find important information about the topic. As you can see, education is the most important reason why we use computers. Now, I think you understand how computers are important in @LOCATION1's education, pleasure and convienience.

555	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Millions of people die every year from lung cancer caused by smoking. There are company so much,they make our life polluted.To take care of the environment,each of us has to do anything such as propaganda to the people in the country,...about my village, we use banana leaf stead of nilon, garbage desposal sensibly...and so on. However, some people without discipline still smoke in the public areas even if they know that it is prohibited. Smoking in public places such as, restaurants, bars, caffe's must be banned. Restaurants are place for eating and not for smoking. People who smoke in restaurants affect other people who are not smoking called the second hand smokers, and yet they suffer most from inhaling the smell of a cigarette. We all know that many people smoke nowadays so it's only common to see people smoking everywhere they go. Some smokers don't agree with banning smoking in restaurants or even bars but they should also consider the health of others. They should be considerate of the people who do not smoke and for the people who have lung problems such as asthma. Many people today are dying because of lung cancer caused by smoking and or second hand smoke. Someone that smokes knows the risks of smoking and second hand smoke and therefore they should be aware where to smoke by and when it is appropriate to smoke and when it is not. Therefore, I agree with the banning of smoking into public places. A smoker's choice should not affect the health of others. People should be able to enjoy public places without being subjected to smoke. The right to smoke does not mean smokers can subject others to their harmful smoke. First, you should know is the weather, we have a very cold winter and a hot summer compared with the other countries in the middle east.If you want a city with sea you should choose any city in the west or east of Saudi Arabia.Riyadh is the capital City it's in the center of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.All the stores and malls are closed at mid night include the five prays breaks because we need to go for pray for work you need to know what the major you want to work in so I can help you to search for a good job matching you abilities.

"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are harmfully effecting the children, and they are going to effect @CAPS1 generations even more. This experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister (I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money. If they are needed for a school project that fine but using the computer everyday rather than exercising is not okay. Supporters of technology say that computers have a positive effect. I have to disagree. They say they practice hand eye coordination, they can teach you about far away places and you can talk with people online. Sports are a great way to exercise and practice hand eye coordination. Tennis, baseball, basketball, hockey, etc are all great sports that practice hand eye coordination. They are much healthier that I.Ming your friends all day. I am also committed to preparing monthly reports for newspaper supplement “The Voice of Women” which issued by the WATC “Women's Affairs Technical Committee , and I have the cooperation with the Environment and Development the magazine which issued by Center for development work ""Maan"", annd other web sites and news and media organizations. ""@CAPS1 generations are becoming way to dependant."" says @PERSON1, my @NUM1 grade @CAPS2 teacher. Michael went into the teacher office,but he found that his teacher isn't here,maybe teacher went to the bathroom,suddenly,the door is opened by teacher,a teacher who wore bikini came into sight,this incident came as quite a surprise to Michael,she flirted with Michael,Michael felt excited but run out of the office,but he had regret for his action,Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. ""@CAPS3 a family is hard work,"" my mom tells me, ""your family needs food which means someone needs a job, and someone also needs to get the food. That takes a lot of time and energy."" I agree with my mom, and if simple things like going outside for an hour a day are practiced as a child, having a job and @CAPS3 a family will be easier. Spanih´s food is fantastic, althouh there are a lot of restaurant for eat you and i think that the food is more expensive than your country.If you don´t like spanish´s food you can go restaurant the other country, but i know you love it. The internet is a realitively new data basis. However, it has grown so much. You cannot always trust internet sources. People who @MONTH1 have posted the website could very well be crazy. Plus websites are filled with viruses, and what happens when your computer is dead due to viruses and you actually need your computer for a school project? I think it would be important that, not only in the family, but also in the school could be grow a new generaion sensible to ecological problems of the earth. The books are trusted and filled with information. The internet is also not a very safe place. Facebook, aim, email, twitter, etc are all ways for people to comunicate through the computer. Facebook, aim and twitter are scary and not safe because you @MONTH1 not know who you are talking to. They do have a profile which you @MONTH1 be able to relate to, but they could be lying. ""The internet is a broad place open to strangers,"" my dad says. I am not allowed to have these ways to comunicate because of the specific reasons that I stated earlier. My parents are doing this to protect me and I agree with their decision. Rather than talking to complete strangers go over to your friends house. Your friends are the people that you want to talk to and spend time with. Overall computers are bizarre pieces of technology that can be unsafe, not truthful, and are forcing children to become more dependent on adults. I have to disagree with the supporters of technology. There are many healthy alternatives to the computer. I believe that experts who are concerned that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Not only do the alternatives that I stated before keep people safe, they also practice a healthier way of living. I will tell you a review of a thriller, the thriller is Hunger games it is about some capitals and people are choised and play on a game, you have to kill persons for they don't kill you, is a movie that have suspense because you want to know ho survey, in the movie someone love someone and protect each others, is very cute but on the 3 movies they are bad moments with the family, capitals, Friends, etc."	4

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Picture this: you come home one day after work and before you even enter the house, you hear music blaring from your child's room. As you step closer, you begin to hear the lyrics that go with the banging bass and you realize that that isn't just any music, it's completely unedited, expicit versions of vulgar songs. Now, who would want their child listening to songs that make it seem like drinking, doing drugs, and other various risky activities are okay? I know I sure wouldn't. Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, @CAPS1 shows, movies, on the @CAPS2, you name it. i was at this team for 5 years and the made me even better in football.I played my first match at 16 years old and i felled very special because i was 16 and i was capable of putting 3 goals. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be rented by people who are of a certain age. Just because it's bad doesn't mean that it has to completely vanish from the face of the world. As Automotive Industries are huge in market, most of the  house holders  prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time . That applies to everything that could contain offensive material. Kids are kids. There are certain things that should be absolutely off limits to them--such as explicit movies, books, music, etc.--as they do not need to know about drugs, sex, or alcohol at such a young age. I used my car every day however few a few I started to take public transport for I can to save up money But, as mentioned earlier, censorship should only be to a certain degree. Keeping childrens' minds clean for as long as possible would be a very positive thing to do for both them and our society in general"	4

"Dear @PERSON1, Advances in technology and computers is a bad thing. But in some day tow guise with quad bike and they saw some thing wrong they sad what's that , they sow dead body , they skared and run to ther camp . As a child did you spend all of your time indoors and online? Computers take time away from spending time outside, or exercising. And they affect very crucial family time. Computer advances are bad for our country and town. ""Annabelle"" is a horror movie which i am going to watch this Saturday.I am wondering if i will be scared after the movie.The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was closed in a museum from Conecticut where she is visited  by a preist  who blesses her twice a month.John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife :a beautifull colection doll dressed in a wedding dress.Unfortunatelly,in a horribble night the couple""s house was invided by a satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them.The satanists invoced an eavel entity that is capabale of the worst things...Annabelle.After Mia gives birth to her doughter Lilly,Annabelel wants to kill her.Even the preist doesn's know how to help the unhappy familly.Everyone is terryfied and find out that a demon is attached by the doll.Idon't know the end of the story but i don;t think that is a happy one... This can have a very negative affect. First of all, it is important that students see and feel nature, and last time I checked they can not do that on a computer. Children need to see animals, smell the sweet scent of flowers and feel the breeze brush against their cheeks. A second reason that going outside is important is for the sun. Even though the sun does have harmful days, it is still important for health that everyone spends some time in the sun. The computer takes times away from nature which is unhealthy and dangerous. people ,espicially grnerator's owner, start using Canaopies, using very long pipes to get rid off as possible as they can from the polution. If people spend all their time on computers, then do they exercise. positives ways for playing badminton: you can lose weight , you vision will be good etc   negatives ways for playing badminton: you right arm is more strong than you left arm , sometime,you are sprain your arm . Also, obesity numbers have increased greatly since the invention of personal computer and the internet. Obesity can make life difficult for people and can also lead to disease. Life with computers has lead to less people exercising and obesity rates increasing. Another issue computers cause is that people are spending less time with their families. Family is one of the most important things in the world and everyone should spend a few hours daily with their family. Plus with encouregement from their family, many students excel in school and sports, which gives them graet self-confidence. Computers take time away from something that should be thw most important to everyone, family. Many people are affected negatively by computers. The technology takes very important time away from children and adults. It takes time away from the outdoors, exercising, and family. Yes, computers @MONTH1 make life easier, but they have a much more negative affect than they do a positive one."	4
559	Lifetstyle: Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"According to the information donne, the most used is the car thus most of the families has one, but the public transportation is getting more and more common for those ones who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectfully with the planet. Based on the characteristic of individuals, some people prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day's work, on the other hand, some people prefer to get up later in the day and work until late at night. Although many people insist that getting up late is better, getting up early in the morning and start the day's work, that can face a morning with energy and freshness is beneficial with several reasons. First of all, the sunlight gives energy in daily life. Sun rises at about 6 A.M. in the morning, and get dark at about 6 P.M. Human's life-cycle is based on the sun rise rhythm; therefore, matching the rhythms with sun rise will give more energy in daily life. Her sons have a problem they cant see the natural light and one they Grace got up because her children were shouting and crying so she went to their bedroom and the courtins was not there so she go to the other room and the courtins also were not there so she stars getting nervous and more nervous so she go and talk to the servants, so she got very angry and she told them go out of my house and they did not care so she pick up a gun and the old lady returned her keys. In addition, it is important to spend more time with family. The social norms usually make us work at the day-time, and get rest when it gets dark. Schools, companies, and other social infrastructures follow this rule for the uniformity of society. Getting up early in the morning and start the day's work can be naturally harmonized with these social flows; however, getting up late in the day makes it difficult to interact with others. Some argue that getting up late is beneficial because it ensures the enough time to rest. However, these enough times to rest is not only given to whom get up late. Getting up early, and finishing the given tasks early can ensure the enough time to rest too. Since it is possible to spend time with family, more enjoyable leisure time can be given when get up early in the morning. To sum up, starting the day early have various benefits. From the beginning of the world till now , human wants the fast income and the easy ways of live , so he tries more and more to find a solution for  his problems by creating a new ways of liveing more easy and more convenient  for him. All the individuals have their own lifestyles. one day he got fight with her sister, even he made her cry.both of them stop talking to each other and after some day the boy need laptop of her sister sukh. However, more energetic, fresh day is waiting to whom get up early. Again, getting up early in the morning will bring positive effects to life, as well as society."	4

"I want to turn to his hobbies, when he isn't working, he is riding on a bike, every evening he takes the bike and rides across some paths for more than forty kilometers by day, so he is very good rider and its quite strong to ride with him. Whether the books relate well or poorly to each person is not something for a mass of people to decide. Every person has a different outlook on what makes a story interesting. so, i`m rely thinking left this sport.Everyday i get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends.i`m exercising more and more again to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world.i`m champion in my sport so, i`m seek to do all my effort to be the first one in the world.finally I did not find encourage of my family or my teachers. Designed with distinctly different minds, people want to read distinctly different books, written by distinctly different authors. You should knew about the prize for coming to the museum is very cheap ($15.00) for hour if you want to stay more time the prize increase in $10.00. Never, will one book bind the world. for example, lunch time travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emission of carbon mono oxide which is effected to red blood cells and irritate to breathing system. For example; reading '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' by @PERSON2 in my @CAPS3 class last year was more than appropriate, though rather boring for the majority of the class. Books of racism, religion, and sexual content intrigue a person's mind, or otherwise disgust one's. Finding satisfactory books for everyone in a community to agree simply will not ever be done. There will always be that one person who declines to agree. I will tell you a review of a thriller, the thriller is Hunger games it is about some capitals and people are choised and play on a game, you have to kill persons for they don't kill you, is a movie that have suspense because you want to know ho survey, in the movie someone love someone and protect each others, is very cute but on the 3 movies they are bad moments with the family, capitals, Friends, etc. It is a choice for each person to read what he or she wants to read. If you force something upon a society of readers, then what will they have left for their own minds' freedom? Face it, forcing an atheist to read an emotionally comprehensive novel of the @CAPS4 faith will not be stood for by the reader. Cursing, to some people, brings a book to a realistic point. To others, however, it draws them further and further away from the story. A choice should remain a person's right; especially to read a book written to be read. Finding an appropriate book is not the problem. That has yet to become the problem. The only problem is finding appropriate books that are both compelling and enthralling. I find '@CAPS5 in the @CAPS6' to be dangerously inappropriate. first we uses Internet to discover the world's news, from Internet we can check and read world's most famous newspaper such as new York times, the sun and also electronic newspaper.Internet also can be used to learn and to educate yourself, internet allow us to read books, magazines and short stories.Internet is the most effective way to start a business and to look for a job, many people uses Internet to work , and they earning money every month.Internet is a way to make new friends all over the world through social websites such as Facebook,twitter, and you tube.As a conclusion internet is making things better and easier, life now is always connected to the Internet. Others that I know choose not to read it because of the offensive content. Do I find it offensive to some? No, but I understand where others could find it offensive. There is no way to approve a book to not be offensive, because it is not offensive to every person who reads it. this situation to create many pollution for environment so we have more conscience for the planet health To sum up the full idea of this position; every person should be given the choice to read what he or she desires. Give each person the choice, and the rebellion will settle down. Removing a book from a shelf just puts the craving in the hearts of certain people to read it; sometimes completely rebelliously. Katherine Paterson is extremely correct by saying that taking a book from a shelf everytime someone wants one banned will not leave books for anyone. As a person, I am well associated with my mind, and it desires the freedom of choice. Every human mind desires the freedom to choose. Give people the choice. Remove no books from a shelf, and let the outcome draw in whoever is interested in whatever they @MONTH1 be interested in. Let readers have their freedom."	4
561	Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"Since computers were invented, there have been arguments about whether computers make life easier and more convenient, and even now, they make controversy. There are two main perspectives. One is that computers make life easier and more convenient, and the other is that computers have made life more complex and stressful because they made people work outside the workspaces and cause various of diseases especially for eyes. Though, second perspective is lso persuasive, I think computers have made easier and more convinient because they offer a lot of softwares that can entertain people, improve the productivity of people, and connect people to people. First, computers have improved our productivity in workspaces. Before the computers have invented, when people want to get statistical informations, they needed to calculate and compare all the values they got from their investigation. In contrast, after the invention of the computers and development of spreadsheet office program, all the statistical analysis have been able to do with just some mouse clicks and draggings. Therefore, people have advanced the ability to use bigger size of datasets which are more meaningful than small datasets an improved work efficiency. Second, computers have connected people more closely. After the invention of computers and distrbution of internet services, various types of online communications have been created. These new communication tools have different characteristics to other communication methods like phone call and SMS(small size message of mobile phone), for example, Facebook, one of the most popular SNS nowadays, have a simple-blog like form of communication. When people want to share somthing, then people write and upload a short post with pictures. And then other people who have access permission to that post can read it and write comments. That's how people communicate through Facebook and it is unpresented way of communication before. My advice of finding work, is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work.But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase. I have confessed that in the first time I didn´t like it very much because I was a bit shy boy and I cost a lot of effort to integrate with the other players of the team but with the passage of the time I liked more and more. However, the stress from work is not from the computers, it's from the work. Before the invention of the computers, people didn't work outside workspaces, however, they worked for more than 20 hours, in 19C. Because of the improved productivity by computer, people can go back to their home, not always work in workspaces, so working outside workspaces cannot be the bad effect of computers, reversely, it's an evidence of more comfortable life than past by computer. The computers offer people productivity-improving tools and connect people. There are many accidentally problems encountered by international students studying in Australia.It is believed that the most important one of the problem is culture barrier.Because of different culture backgrounds,the talking  style of internaional students who come from different countries are various. Her sons have a problem they cant see the natural light and one they Grace got up because her children were shouting and crying so she went to their bedroom and the courtins was not there so she go to the other room and the courtins also were not there so she stars getting nervous and more nervous so she go and talk to the servants, so she got very angry and she told them go out of my house and they did not care so she pick up a gun and the old lady returned her keys."	4
562	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"I would like to change dormitory about my university
     KAIST has many dormitories. But, Many students have complains about dormitory. KAIST is the best engineering university in Korea. Considering KAIST name value, KAIST does not have good dormitory. To our relief,she was saved and when we went to granny room,we saw smile on her face.We were also happy,but in Michael head came a lot of things.He knew that if we escape at that moment when the granny was at the ground,she would most probably die.Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. i like volei because it was part of my life and of life of my mother, is my favorite sport, but i like over sports too, same i don't play volei because I'm bad, and my friends that know, don't like of  peoples bad of volei.I'm watching they playing, they're really very good, but when play over school, they're very bad Some rooms have their own bathroom or toilet. But, many rooms do not have their own bathroom or toilet. Students who are taken these rooms use bathroom and toilet which are outside the room together with other students. This system make students uncomfortable. In KAIST community app, some students said, ""I do not want to use bathroom or toilet with other students. It is very uncomfortable for me."". So, our university should change every rooms has their own toilet and bathroom. Second, there are noise problem. In statistics, about 52% students have noise problem. Many students in the dormitory spend hard time especially at night. They want to go to sleep, but some roommates and other rooms' students make noise. There are two cases which make noise problems at night. people ,espicially grnerator's owner, start using Canaopies, using very long pipes to get rid off as possible as they can from the polution. I think one of my favorites sports of all is the atletism I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself, you have to be every day better than you where yesterday, it force you to improve every time, also is an exercise that help all your body, especially the legs because it gives them great strength, but also your hands because they have to be in a constant movement, and all the body in general because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and help you to have coordination. So, our university should change dormitory rule strict and change dormitory structure more efficient to defend noise between each rooms. To summarize, there are two reasons why we should change dormitory in KAIST. In those days almost 80% of people have assured feel preocupation about their bodies and their alimentation, for this they convidenced me that they will try improve their habitual alimentation everyday and their will do sport more frequently. Second reason is that most students are uncomfortable about noise problem especially at night. So, I hope our university change every rooms has their own toilet and bathroom, change dormitory rule strict and change dormitory structure more efficient to defend noise between each rooms quickly."	4

Nowadays, many people take for granted the knowledge that can be obtained there. Even more of the knowledge to be learned is being stripped away and cut down by censorship. Censorship can eliminate many varieties of reading materials that people can learn from and enjoy. Negaticvs about the online lerning are dat your not listening to much from ea real person and more from a Computer, if you dont have any listening things in the app you dont lern how to pronounce the words. If they offend you then do not read them. It is as simple as that. Many books offend people because they are not in agreement with their morals or beliefs. A great example of this is the @PERSON2 series. @PERSON2 @PERSON2 is a bestselling series with over a million copies that have been sold worldwide; however, it does not corrolate with many people's beliefs. Therefore those people boycott the series. I remember several years ago I attended a @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 party at the local library to celebrate the next book in the series being released. While I was at the library there was a gigantic storm brewing. We're looking for a new nice home and so we are truly interested to keep your place tide and take care about it as it were our own. They said that we were worshipping the devil and @CAPS4 brought the storm to tell us that what we were doing was wrong. I know many people do not like the @PERSON2 series because there is witchcraft and wizardry in it, but that does not mean that they should blame natural occurences on a book! as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! For a while, @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 was reading material for school, but then the 'morality police' banned it because it was about a crazy person. Books should not be required to meet everyone's personal standards. Often the evolution is return of origins however I hope that the man in the next years will be to don't forget the past. If we ban books because we do not agree with them or find them suitable, eventually there will not be any left to check out at the library. Good morning everyone,today I want to share about is my favorite sport.My favorite sport is football,why I choose it?Well,football is a international sport,people around the world will love it so much!Example like Barclay Premier League,Liga Premier,Fifa World Cup and so on.I believe that's all will delighted us.By the way,my favorite football team is Manchester United,they are brilliant,they have an amazing football players,and they are awesome. If the books with questionable content had a sticker on them telling the reader that, then it could benefit both sides. In conclusion, eliminating books is not a good idea because of how beneficial they are to us all, especially children. When I was young I would always want to be read to and when I continued to age I would always read. While I was in middle school every day I would have a book with me to read. Books allow the reader to travel to far off places or see what it would be like to walk in someone else's shoes. Books are a gateway to another world. Why take that magic away from children"	4

"How would you feel if you were forced to only enjoy the exact things that everyone else enjoys? If you were limited to only certain subjects because all of the other choices were thrown out you might begin to feel trapped. so, i`m rely thinking left this sport.Everyday i get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends.i`m exercising more and more again to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world.i`m champion in my sport so, i`m seek to do all my effort to be the first one in the world.finally I did not find encourage of my family or my teachers. So I believe that each person should be able to read any book they would like without any restrictions. Some reasons for my opinion are personal values, unique interests, and the fact that people should have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others. For my first reason goes along with personal values. For example a person of higher authority @MONTH1 find a particular book, magazine, or movie inappropriate due to their values and beliefs. So if this person is the owner of the library they would be able to throw out all books and movies pertaining to that topic. This would make it unfair for the people who do enjoy these topics. My next reason is that every single person has their own unique interests. If someone begins to dispose of books that they are not interested in the library will lose all of the visitors that do find that topic enjoyable. This can cause the library problems and be a disappointment to those who find reading about that certain topic a great way to pass time. But I think that the future is the public transport, we need preserve nature, this is an imperative for our world, then the solution have to take the point that the governments do more invest in public transport, so the people don´t need to get a car for being able to have a job and don´t need it for normal development of their lives. They should not be forced to read only the things that are selected by another person. People should also have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others. In our earth, Hunderds of millions prople living in here.Except us, There are also a large number of wildlife. If everyone did the things that every other person does our world would not accomplish anything out of the ordinary. Many people find inspiration from books and movies so if these were limited to only particular subjects people would begin to feel pressured to be the same. the development technology and Industry very fast , so the public transport no future , Must be Interesting the development transport Even fits the times. Books should be something that each person should have a choice in. If there are endless choices of books and movies a person could learn about many different things and develope a more open mind. If everyone in this world opened their mind people would become more accepting of others. television entertains as well as it will educate the people.These days are educating themselves by watching the television.Televison not only provide entertainment it will give lots of information about the happenings around the globe.Channels like national geographic and animal planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origination of species.Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people No one should be limited because of other people's values or interest. The right to read the books, magazines, and watch the movies you like should always be present."	4

"my town tries all the time to make our town more beautiful and comfortable by taking more care of the environment,they provide us by good buses which are friends to the environment and offer the tickets for this buses in a cheap price,they also trying to find the best way to make the rubbish more useful by the recycling,also the people tries all the time to find the best way for keep our village clean;they never throw the rubbish in the streets or the gardens,also they take care of the fuel in their cars to not to be bad for the environment,so,it's our duty to take care of our village and the whole environment beside the government. Would you want your children influenced by these findings? These are the question you need to ask yourself about certain materials that appear in libraries. Ferrari making one of the fastes cars on the word, but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac, how they were in the past.If sameone like cars then should go to Formula 1 race to hear the bolid engine sound, I think that is the best voice which I have ever heard in my life.Formula 1 it is also  dangerous sport, the driver are exposed to the risk of  accident at high speed. The people of my town try to plant plants in the centre or somewhere is too smoke, so they try to keep the air at recommended levels.on the morning a lot of people go on footto the work or to the school or ride a bike or they take the bus.The people try to move the local factories out of country where is less air polluted ,less smoke,less cars and more forests and plants. I believe that these materials should not be found in libraries. There are many people that still would want these materials, so my suggestion is that there should be a seperate room for the offensive materials. If there was a seperate room, we can keep these materials away from young kids. When I get older and have children, I believe that the library should be a kid friendly place. In order to make that happen we need find a place for these materials or not have them at all. Libraries need to be somewhere were anyone can go: a college kid trying to prepare for a test, a young child wanting to discover @PERSON1, or a old man wanting to enjoy the peace and quiet. The distraction of offensive materials are not needed in a library. Libraries are places to learn and explore the different sources that are inside. For young children it is the fairytale land where anything is possible and the unimaginable can become true. If there are materials that adults do not want their children to see, they @MONTH1 not be comfortable having their child there. Libraries need to be kid friendly places, so that all the ages can enjoy what it has to offer. For all the people I advise to start to play or watching football because for me it is a very good sport , but you can play a good football only if you really like it , because first football is fun . All ages should be able to enjoy what a library has to offer, and with some materials that is not possible. Please consider the following. Kind regards,         @PERSON2"	4
566	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"College students are stuck in a strange period of their lives - they are expected to behave like adults in society, and yet do not the financial prowess of one. Mired in a busy schedule of academic work, the results of which will probably have a critical bearing on the rest of their lives, college students can sometimes barely find the time to enjoy an adequate social life, much less ensure a fixed income for their ever increasing appetite for spending and consuming. My name is shousheng and live in Montreal Canada.Alrough Canada is an English country however in Montreal, the offical language is Freach. While it is certainly good to be gain some financial independence, the trade-off for such part-time jobs would be time spent on studies, on making friends and networks that can only be gotten in college, and spending time on extra-curricular activities that will develop into useful skills and interests for life. Moreover, part-time jobs usually have meager pay, and the learning opportunities for a temporary staff member is small to say the least --- the returns on such a job can far outweigh its costs, and thus students may be better off not having a part-time job. It is thus sometimes far more important to make sure one is making full use of his or her college life - a once in a lifetime occurrence - rather than spend precious time slaving away for a little bit of money."	4

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear Newspaper, ""@CAPS1 no!' I forgot the deffinition to this homework problem and I don’t have my notes. Now, in this situation a computer would be very helpful to just type in the word and get a whole bunch of results. This is why I believe having access to a computer at all times is very helpfull because you can find information that you've been needing. You can get in touch with a friend if you need to or just to talk to lostly if you are just sitting around and having nothing to do you can just go on the computer and discover things you @MONTH1 not have known. Having access to a computer is a real and very helpfull because if your just having a conversation with someone and you forget a name of an important fact you want to tell them, you can always just look it up. For me, a lot of the times I just need information about maybe a sports player of facts about a famous event. Since our technology is so up to date the computer is right there sitting with many of the helpfull facts we would like to know. Friends are a big part of my life and I love just to talk to them and see how they are doing. Again, our technology is so advanced now that there is a bunch of websites where we can talk and see how we are doing. A big reason why being able to talk to friends and family is helpful is for taking to people that are very far away and the ones you dont normally see. Firstly, the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel.Secondly, the public vehicle route are more far than usual route.Thirdly,it is also crowded and no privacy.Finally,there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker. Finally, the times I find having a computer around me most helpfull is when I am just bored with nothing to do! The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots. On the internet there are many things to keep you occupied like games or ou can even watch movies from your home onto the computer! If you have a computer around your house you should not be bored because there is many things you can be doing or even learning! Having a computer around your house is so helpfull, you can have fun but your even learning how to be good with technology at the same time. When I want studying for exams  going to the living room and sitting front of TV In addition, there is a small blackboard for my littel brother because my mother wants my prother learn Arabic and English letters. So I suggest you pick one up and just have a blast, you wont be sorry."	4
568	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Everybody has their own way of studying. Some people prefer to study alone while other people prefer to study with a group of students. Students who prefer the group studing say they can be motivated by their group members and can use a large seminar room. Pass some years  of the university and he know a girl called Kate and he get loved on here and she get loved in him. First,  students who prefer a group studying think that the group members can motivate them to study hard. It is partially true, but I think it doesn't make sense for all cases. It is because this also means we can be easily unmotivated by other group members. An day in the morning Paxton waited to Long y the writer, but he listened that called him suddenly he goes for the beach and is killed for the shadow Moreover, when we study with others, it is easy to be disturbed by their noise. In addition, to study with a group of students, we should meet at specific time. However, they have some disadvantages with a public transport, they gave many traffic jam, this is because the bus a large and difficult to control . Therefore, we cannot use our time fluently. However, in case of studying alone, we can concentrate our own work without disturbance and can use our time more fluently. Second, some people prefer to study with a group of students since they can use the school seminar room which needs 4 people to make reservation. However, this also means that it is hard for group to find a suitable studying place. In fact, it is hard to seat together with a group in library. In many cases, they have to be split. Or, they have to move another place to have a seat. In other words, studying with a group of students have some space limitation. However, when we study alone, we don't need to worry about to get a seat in library. It is more easier to get one seat in library. In conclusion, for me, studying alone is better than studying with a group of students. It is because studying alone allow us to study without interrupt with others. In addition, studying alone make us to use our time more efficiently and has less space limitation compare with studying with a group."	4

No matter what your favorite classic piece of literature was, you recall the wonderful feeling you felt when reading it. It enveloped you into its world, and you felt every sensation it offered. What is this though? The author is a @CAPS2. The author uses occassional bad words. First, Basketball is team sport when it means i need to understand expression of  members  of team and keep contact them  for example  my roll is cutter but i need to do assister, blocker and guarding when i play. This is not an acceptable excuse to miss out on everything literature offers. Censorship in pulic libraries is wrong. The @CAPS3 was a dark time. Thousands upon thousands of @CAPS4 people were killed for their religious belief, as well as homosexual people, and other minorities. Amidst all of this chaos, the @ORGANIZATION1 decided it would be a good idea to burn all books written by @CAPS4 authors. So they did. Millions of books were eradicated along with their owners all because of a religious difference. Does it even need to be asked?

A curse word, a bit of skin, a controversial idea. Sometimes these are needed for emphasis of the compilation. Imagine how much less forceful an angry character would be without a few curses every now and then. Pathetic. So is it worth it to you? Will you give up a beautiful composition because it is controversial? Will you hide your children from materials that will make them form their own opinions? One thing is certain, I will not. I will stand against censorship until it has felt the mighty blow that it has inflicted on so many beautiful works. this country are many interesting pLaces to visit,if you wantto have adventure you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza.If you want to have fun you may go to parque de la Costa there are many interesting rolercoasters.And if you want to go the best museum of art in Argentina you should go to malba.

"Let's go back around @NUM1 years ago. Those were days when it could take weeks to communicate with out of state family. Days when knowledge was only found in books, and ofen found slowly. One day a man and his wife were trying to found a place shallow and without pollution for cultivate, they were poor; they don’t have the necessary sources, but the husband work so hard because his wife had an accident it occurred one day that his wife was working in a campaign of conservation of animal in endangered, she went to a place in search of animals, she heard a sound in a dark place of the jungle so she went to investigated what was that, a creature that have never seen attack she, her partner only heard a shout and they found Lucy the wife of the man in the floor, they ask she if she is ok but he don’t answered so her partner toke it to the doctor, there the doctor said that she was ok but he will never hear again or only if she paid 1 000 dollar for a operation. Computers change all that. The first two step is to design with background color artwork and security issues and prepare metal plates with skilled machinists.Then there are some requirments for printing sheets:color on both sides, special ink and images slightly raised.The most essential and key process is manual inspections for printed sheets with three categories: good quality sheets, patially damaged sheets and bad sheets. This helicopter had humid then the helicopter star to rotate in all the island then the helicopter go sinking in the water then the hurricane finished  the engineers start to distribute the food and medicine. I can relate, with @NUM2 cousins in @LOCATION2 and @NUM2 in @LOCATION1. Without these instant messages and emails, we would more than likely talk to them once, maybe twice a year! Some people say that computers make people spend less time interacting with family and friends. For me personally, and I know many others, interaction would be impossible without these modern manuals. With all the @LOCATION1 technology out there. Nothing has me as amazed as the webcam. You, with this tool, can talk face to face with someone on the other side of the world! The world is a better place when we can have a true connection to other cultures, and what better way than to talk to them. That was me, I never liked studying, I never found myself in those subjects, but it wasn't the big deal to me, I hated is being seen as unsuccessful or a loser, as I wasn't that, I knew that I'm clever enough to study all these subjects and do well in exams so I can get high marks but they're all didn't get that, they judged me for my marks but marks don't form brains or thoughts, marks isn't the only way that makes you great now and then in the future. you must think a little bit before you talk as  one word causes a lot of pain for others for the rest they lives .you may not  actually notice that but you  will feel what am really mean if  someone tells you a painful words . These are grown ups, using the tools available to improve their lives. Internet goes beyond teenagers on @CAPS3 and @CAPS4. What you can find online still amazes me. The information you could get out of @NUM2 non-function books, you could find in turn minutes on the internet. Any question, including personal, anything, can be answered. Years ago people would have killed for this power, for the common man to be able to access all he ever needed to. I see the point people make about needing excersize and they're right. But in five minutes on the web you could have an exersize routine planned out, with modern techniques and styles. The computer has anything for anyone. Looking for some place to enjoy nature & @ORGANIZATION1 it. In seconds there will be thousands thousands of results. Missing a dictionary? There are literaly hundreds of sites to find a definition online. I notice that in supermarkets are using so much plastic just to cover a small thing or are using many plastic bags without even think how vulnerable is for the environment. The technology is there. Why not use it? I could never turn down an opportunity to talk to a distant cousin, or another kid from a different country. I couldn't pass up a chance to check up on some old buddies that moved away. Thanks to computers, I have that opportunity. I have that chance. I've been shown an open door to find out everything I could want. After preparing of metal plates by skilled machinists,it takes sheets of bank .There are three requirements fot it:colour on both sides,special ink and images slighty raised. But these days, he can find out anything. I'm not sure if the omputer has changed the direction of advancing technology, but I can tell you, it has definitly offered the course."	4

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I would like to notify your business that computers benefit society. Computers allow people to talk to friends and family, they are important resources for many jobs as well as school work, and they allow people to learn and store information. I advise any one dream to be one of the most famous teams that works on hisself a lot & and play football a lot to be profectional in this sport & show a lot of matches &followed by captain supervised on him my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long. I like to go on the computer, mostly because I'm able to speak with my friends. Often the evolution is return of origins however I hope that the man in the next years will be to don't forget the past. I'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant its name is ""Lemon"" I go there every week it has different food from any restaurants I'd like chicken crispy with garlic sauce It's Excellent choice for me and My favorite appitizer is susage and in order that desert I'd rather ""Vadge"" cake with chocolate sauce I feel I;m at ease when I go there I enjoy  classical music over having a lunch about the service It's very good and all staff are respectable I can't imagine one week without going there that drives me nuts I advise any one to go there and enjoy  a time there , also this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really It's  excellent This strikingly thing for anyone  despite all of these advantages prices are not expensive . For instance, last month I sprained my ankle and I stayed home from school for one day. So I went on facebook at around @TIME1, when everyone was home from school and my friend told me what was for homework that night. So, now because of our computers I could catch up on the work that I missed that day of school. Also, if you have family that lives far away or someone in college you can send them an email to keep in touch. My cousin is in college right now and I always talk to him on the computer to see how he is doing. For example, we always talk about sports we are involved with during that time of year. As you can see, computers are a great way to keep in touch with family and talk to friends. Secondly, computers are a big part of many peoples lives because many jobs involve computers; as well as school. Computers are a very useful piece of technology because people use computers for paying bills, jobs and more. For example, my dad tests computer programs as a job. The programs are constructed, then corrected and revised, then finally sent out all over the world. If people weren't allowed to use computers then many people would lose their jobs and many families would be in huge debt. Also, children do a lot of school work on the computer. For example, I take spanish and I earn culture points for my class by answering a question on the computer. Studies show that over @PERCENT1 of children use computers for some sort of school work. Computers are a big part of the working society today. Not only are they well-known for its long tradition but it also famous for the hospitality of inhabitants living here which attract domestics and foreign tourists come here to see the famous sights as well as shopping for souvenirs.They are closely located the local art gallery which take about 15 minutes to go by foot. The computer holds a lot of valuble information. There is facts and fasinating pictures about different countries. most of girl doesnt like this,i think that it takes us energy,we need to do exercise,reasonable diet...and so on. For instance, my uncle was on the computer one day and he was looking at places in @LOCATION1 and after a long hard thinking process him and his family moved there and they still live there to this day. Computers inspire people to learn and see different places and @MONTH1 lead them to something important one day. In conclusion, I feel very strongly about how positive computers are to society today. I know that you will feel the same way because computers have so much to offer."	4
572	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"There are lots of electronic devices and communication technologies today, so many courses in college are operated on the online. I think one of my favorites sports of all is the atletism I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself, you have to be every day better than you where yesterday, it force you to improve every time, also is an exercise that help all your body, especially the legs because it gives them great strength, but also your hands because they have to be in a constant movement, and all the body in general because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and help you to have coordination. There are many advantages of taking online courses, and students and professors can make more effective courses through online courses. I will introduce about three main reasons about those advantages. First of all, students and professors can remove limitations of time and space through online courses. As I said already, today’s electronic devices and communication technologies are very convenient, and it is effective to make remote classrooms. For example, there are many useful platforms, such as Zoom and KLMS. They can participate in the courses without the limitation of space. Also, it is able to take courses whenever. Because students do not have to try to participate in the real classroom and in real time with using of money and energy, they can focus on studying more efficiently. It gives the students the freedom to choose his major and the teachers.In addition, it has a lot of facilities that serve students like kindergarten that takes care of children these employees, university housing, hospital the student of medicine can be application in it and it serves the people too, and a big library has many books in various languages. There are many benefits if student studies by searching Internet or using other useful programs with electronic devices. In the case of real classroom, there are limitations to provide these functions based on Internet to all of students. other people prefer to travel by trains as it's faster and more comfortable than cars.Many countries like to travel by bikes in order to decrease the pollution which happened by car exhausted.to my point of view i prefer travelling by cars which is more comfortable. For instance, this type of teaching will be very helpful for courses like programming courses. the tecnology have chanched the people's life very much.in fact we can think how different is our life respect either to our parents or our grandparents life.for example my parents didn't whacth on tv, because there wasn't any tv on the world when they were young.but it isn't the alone difference:we can think at the mobilefone,the computer ed at least the internet.our grandparents woundn't imagine a strange machine like computer in their life. As I said before, it is the main reason why colleges want to operate online courses. It is not need to meet in the real classroom for online courses, so colleges can keep students’ safety. Moreover, students living in other countries are not easy to come into Korea in this serious situation. The rate of foreign students is pretty high in KAIST, so online courses are necessary. This reason may be applied for other serious accidents or disasters such as earthquake and typhoon. In short, taking online classes has three main advantages. Because of taking online classes, it is able to reduce the limitations of time and space, and make courses more flexible and active, and prevent the spreading of COVID-19. Although there are many students who want to take offline courses, but taking online courses is also good decision in the situation of COVID-19 especially. As we know public transportation has not a direct way to fulfill our all destinations then it force us to stop in many stations first, moreover we should take the other one to reach our destination so it is already obvious why using a car is better."	4

"A colossal number of significant and life-changing books can be found in the millions of libraries throughout the world. We can change  everything hurt us if we need if we have volition The reasons for  stress are more diverse perhaps because  we have an  exam period,  family proplems or because we think in negative way,  or we destroyed  ourselves  in long hours of working and canceld our needs  for enough comfortable,  and  lots of reasons to stress...   We must get  out of  the stress quickly before  lose ourself because it's very hurtful period, for example you can read a  book,  doing sport,  play music,  eating delicious food, remmeber  all the positive thing was took place with you,  talk about someone who trust for him,  take off every thing make you upset and make you life tiring,  go out and eat meal with your best joking friends,  and  there a lot of you have to do...   Remmeber the stress is not  lasting thing,  and you can avoid  it  But if you  are willing  to live in happy life. In my opinion, there are a certain number of books wasting away on the shelves of the library that need to be disposed of. That is why libraries need to discover which books are creating issues, such as books on race or religion. Although Katherine Paterson boldly argues against taking books off of the shelves, I strongly disagree and believe that libraries should remove materials that are creating tension or books wasting away on the shelves. I choose the wheel because is the most useful invention ever because thanks to it the human works make easier by example a way to move heavy objects, compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today the wheel was invented at a relatively late point of human history, he oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia. @CAPS2, there are exceptions to this proposal. For instance, books talking about the civil war and underground railroad need to be kept in libraries because they are significant historical events. Unlike fantastic books about our nation's history, there are also books about race that are of lesser importance, and they @MONTH1 offend people. In that case, libraries need to crack down on this issue and remove offensive books from the shelves! Secondly, libraries need to be extremely cautious about what music is made available to the public. In my opinion ,Volleyball must then be considered among high-risk sports according to the frequency and gravity of our surgical findings.my advice for who starts this sport you will get fresh after you play this game and makes you doing your work in relaxetion way . As Katherine Paterson mentions in her quote,' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1, that same quote can easily apply to the music on display in the libraries. By libraries exposing children to derogatory music, they are creating enormous liabilities for the children and their families. Overall, our society would benefit greatly if libraries removed derogatory and offensive music. there was also a cup in it,It said""don't give up your dream,keep doing!go!we stand by you!come on""  Tom love it ,""thanks mom,thanks dad! @CAPS2, that is a nieve comment as @CAPS1 as an exaggeration. There are millions of libraries throughout the world and thousands of items in each of those libraries. Therefore, it would benefit our society if we would dispose of the items creating the greatest amount of tension, and there is one simple but effective way of doing that. When people are at the check out desk at the library, the library could have a sheet of paper asking if the customer found a certain book offensive. Michael decided to open the door and back for her, he thought better the things he do not want to leave her again, he like her, he knows himself and he wants to know her, he have kept all his feelings for a long time. That would benefit everybody greatly because the offensive items would no longer be on the shelves, and it takes little effort from all parties involved. In conclusion, I oppose Katherine Paterson's decision and believe libraries should remove offensive materials immediately. One highly controversial topic is race, and if the book is not informing us about a historical event, it should be removed. Certain derogatory and offensive music is available in libraries, and it should be removed from the shelves as @CAPS1. A quick and efficient way of figuring out which books are offensive is to have a list available to the public where they can write down which book they find offensive. Ultimately, libraries need to take action and dispose of the offensive materials that pose a threat to our society"	4
574	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 is a lot of technology including the biggest hit, the computer. I say that computers have a more positive effect on people. Some reasons include that computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and even give you the ability to talk online with other people. Where would we be without computers? First of all, is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. People that type slower usually have poorer hand-eye coordination. Of course with faster typers, they have better hand-eye coordination. @PERCENT1 of people including teachers agree with this. Is this why @CAPS1 is typing ""lessons"" in computer classes in elementary school? The answer is most likely going to be a yes. Second of all, is that computers give people the ability to learn about far away places. Computers give you more resources than a book. Yes,I think it also can educate.As times go by,technology is rapidly improving.More and more gadgets are invented such as televisions,smartphones and so on.There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly.Using will not only gain the entertainment but also get the knowledge.For instance,there are numerous program that we can choose.It is a good time to turn to the entertaining program,when we feel bored and gaze the wall all the day.Television provides educated varieties of channels as well.Discovery channel is posture-oriented model example to educate.We can learn how do the different animals feed on themselves.Above the statements can ensure a rich and abundant live. Using these websites, people can have a higher education. One teacher said, ""using websites is so much easier for everyone. Using them for homework and having the students take notes is a lot less difficult."" And to that I agree entirely. Finally, computers give people the ability to talk to other people online. Using things like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @CAPS3-mail, and video chat. All of these, and more give you the opportunity to chat with friends living far away. That way friendships are never really lost. When printing finished,they should inspection.It the most important step.Printed sheets manually inspected.Finally,they  found good quality sheets and some partially damaged sheeets or bad sheets.They will packaging and distribution the sheets which is good in there.In that time they at fist cut into separate bank notes ,second they packed the sheets and diapatched. Losing one can be very sad. I know this from personal experience. In conclusion, this is why I think that computers are a positive effect on people. From learning to chatting, computers are a great way to chat with friends and even do homework. Hand-eye coordination included. All of these are positive effects don't you think? Sundully happanned sonething, I need to work to play my  studuies in the High  school, so the life changes anyway, I needed to stop my favourite sport, because I should need to study in that moment it was more important for me."	4

Hey my name is Joe and i´m 21 years old and i´l think i´l would compliment the summer camp very good, because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak. Others believe that freedom of speech is a universal right that should extend to any and all forms of human expression. The issue is further complicated by the concept of what is and is not appropriate for children. Are there materials that are acceptable for adults, but not kids? Questions such as this have plagued humanity for hundreds of years, and there is no simple solution. Today, so many people think of censorship as a bad word. In fact, there is nothin inherently wrong with the concept of censorship. I like to play football cause for me, as well as one hobby, is one way to stand out of the world, of the problem that every day I have to face, and at the end it makes me calm and happy. For example, many countries have restrictions on selling and owning copies of '@PERSON2,' the book that @PERSON1 wrote as a sort of mission statement for @LOCATION1. While many of the ideas contained within the book are horribly offensive, it still should not be censored. People have the right to read the book and form their own opinions on @PERSON1's teachings, it is not the government's place to decide for them. While oppressive dictatorship and mass-murder are crimes, reading about them is not. There are few materials available that should rightfully be censored and taken out of adult hands. If someone understands what they are reading, and are able to form an educated opinion on the material, then nobody has the right to stop them from expanding their knowledge, or expressing themself by creating similar material. However, the issue changes completely when one considers children. If adults want to view pornography, or read accounts of extreme violence, that is their business. Secondly, do more cooperation between countries.To illustrate, people should cooperation To intervene to bring peace to the world to stop the war in many areas like what United Nations doing.For example, United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy . Children need to be slowly and gently introduced to these concepts so they can fully understand them. In the case of children, careful censorship is necessary for healthy development. When it comes to libraries, there are very few materials that should be banned. If libraries are meant to be places of learning, then one has no right to limit the information they contain. However, that does not mean there should not be any limitations. Libraries should offer a children's section, as many do, that would contain materials only appropriate for youngsters. Secondly, if you use the car, you haven't wait much time ti catch the bus or the train, and maybe you can arrive later at your job, for this situation. This is terrible, you do not have privacy authought the society have a blame, because if they do not take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored. This system gives parents the ability to keep their children away from harmful material, without taking it out of the hands of adults. Many would argue that unsupervised children could gain access to inappropriate material, but that is really an issue that needs to be handled by parents, not the library. After all, it's better that a few kids see something they shouldn't have than all adults have to read censored material. In conclusion, censorship is a concept that has its place in society, but must be used very carefully. When the goal is to protect people, especially children, from harmful material, it can be used sparingly. However, when those in power use censorship to attack ideas they disagree with, it becomes a form of oppression. Above all else, people must be free to educate themselves, form their own opinions, and express themselves. on the other hand, public transportation takes more time to get to the required station, because already public transport taking long path to go across more places and as more as peoples take benefits from it, and public transport usually crowed and do not be on time."	4
576	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"Some people believe that as college students, we should not have part-time jobs as that will leave us less time on our studies, which is what our primary responsibility is. However, I agree that it is beneficial for college students to have a part-time job, if they have good time management. Firstly, getting a part-time job is the first step to learning how to be independent, and university is the best time to do so. As university course choices and education is more self-directed than in junior college or high school, most college students have much free time on their hands. Having a part-time job is thus a good way of making use of their time wisely, and earning their own income at the same time. Secondly, a part-time job can act as a bridge between college education and their careers in the future. Travelling by car is much more convenient but all know really there is no future for public transport.When we talk about public transport,there are many people and everyone travel but i think we do not feel relax are there and if we talk about travelling by car.It is the best or much more convenient for us.Because we can travel any where but in public transport we can not travel to any other sites Their part-time jobs will allow them to get a better understanding of how the industry/organisation really works, and thus makes their learning more meaningful. Even if their part-time jobs are different from their courses of study, students will still be able to learn universal skills like teamwork, communication skills and the importance of spending money wisely that will help them in their future. In conclusion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job."	4
577	University:Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year. Others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.	"Best Vacation Time for Student

     Vacation time for students is different in each country, some are short and some are very long. There are still lots of debates on whether students should have one long vacation or several short vacations. In my opinion, students should have one long vacation each year. Firstly, students can learn more about the long vocation. There are lots of students who improve themselves during the summer or winter vacation, such as internships or individual research projects. ""As you well know, rose's life is your hands"" she said and keep talking:""...You are the only one, that can save her life, but before you must comply with your promise"". It is hard to continue the study on the regular semester because students need to focus on the schoolwork during the regular semester, so finishing everything they initially planned throughout the vacation is very important. In addition, students can take an actual break on a long vacation. If the vacation is long, students will have enough time to spend on improving themselves and also some time to take a short break after their own project is finished. Students could not fully enjoy their vacation if it is short, because they need to spend some time on improving themselves, such as learning new languages or applying for internships, and they will never have time to take a rest and jump to the regular semester directly. Someone was calling the door while that someone was stealing in your house... By that, her sister is scared and woke up...  Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake Class in the university can be divided into intermediate and advanced, and students usually take them throughout 2 semesters because they need the basic information to take some advanced classes. In this case, the majority of students forget what they learn from last semester so that reviewing is mandatory at the start of the next semester. As long as i try to keep doing thing on a ecofriendly way i realize that i am give a little from my side and i feel careful of my environment. Studying from school is good, however the more important is that students should get to know how to apply what they learn to from the school to the real world, and having a long vacation will give the opportunity to the student to improve their ability."	4
578	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"I disagree on the idea that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Even though smoking is harmful to people who smoke, and also to people who don't smoke but are around, I think we should still respect the smokers' need. To explain it in a simple way, people gain happiness through different kinds of ways. It just happens to be a harmful way for the smokers to gain happiness. It may urge them to quit smoking if the government practices the ban, but to those who haven't succeeded in quitting, it could be a torture if they can't find any place where smoking is allowed except their homes, and further problems might be raised. There should be a substitute plan: Smoking should be banned at the common restaurants, except those with smoking areas apart from non-smoking areas. According to the problems above mentioned,various approaches that governmentshould be adopted to deal with this problem.first of all,reducing building constructure from now on,planting more trees instead.Sustainadle development should be awaness to all human and start to porteat the environment and preserve the animals. Third, any violation on the rules should be heavily-fined. Government should put more effort on educating people, to prevent the non-smokers start smoking, and providing help for the smokers to quit smoking before implementing such strict legislation. Nowadays, the transportation become more prefect,and the people'life become more convenient.Althought this change lend the life of people efficient,the problem should not be ignored.It would really be helpful if the government make tighter resrictions,in today's world ,lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission, they are destroyed the forest,farmland and wetland,charging waster water and emitting greenhouse gas,it lead to a serious enviorment problem.So the government should oversee this companies ,and if companies do not obey the rules or laws ,it will be fined and closed."	4

"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 technology majors support that the use of computers have a positive effect on people and I agree with them. I believe the use of computers are a necesity for social interaction, homework, research, and are a great source of entertainment on a rainy day. After a long day at school @CAPS1 teens go from the bus, to the front door, to their computer chair. In fact, @PERCENT1 of must teens do so. Odds are they're logging into facebook, myspace, formspring, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, and other socially interactive websites. With good time management I actually find these websites important. I think facebook and e-mail and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ( @CAPS5) are a great way to be socially interactive. It's also a great way to keep in touch with long distance family or friends. I go to @DATE1 camp and have made friends I call my family. Some of them being across the ocean in @LOCATION2. Seeing as how I can't make long distance calls which would cost way too much money, facebook is a geat alternative to keep in touch. @CAPS1 of my family also live far away. For example, my aunt, uncle and cousin in @LOCATION1. My aunt just had a baby, meaning I have a new cousin which I'm not able to see in person yet so seeing pictures on facebook instead of spending money on envolopes, stamps and picture prints is really awesome @CAPS1 homework given out in school requires a computer. Three out of five homework assignments are on the computer. Whether it be taking a twenty question test to defining a word the computer is a schoolwork necesity. In school now many projects are assigned meaning we need the computer and internet. We use powerpoint and other microsoft documents whether it be typing an essay or creating a powerpoint slideshow. We need the internet for research to get the information we need, to suceed. We the management of The Arch London Hotel received your mail and wishes to let you know that you should make known to us the position you desired to work in via return mail along with a scan copy of your signed contract of agreement to enable us make every necessary corrections.Thank you. Many people believe people are spending way too much time on the computer. In these diagrams below,the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly.The first step,the bank notes should be desinged concidering some constructions,like background color,artwork and security issues,After it was prepared,skilled machinists would make preparaation of metal plates in the second step.Then,sheets of bank notes would be printed by 50 bank notes per sheet,which have colour imagines on both sides in special ink.After printing well,these sheets would be manually inspected closely.It was the most important step during the whole processing.And then,some  sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets  which would be cut into and separated into equal ones andpacked and depatched to where they are demanded. Many people are concerned children are becoming lazy but in a recent vote @NUM1 out of @NUM2 mothers said they'd radther see their children playing and interacting on the computer then being a couch patato and watching @CAPS6. On a rainy day the computer can be a great alternative. You can slide in a @CAPS7 and watch a movie or play a game or even research something new and learn about it. @NUM3 out of @NUM2 @CAPS8 have at least two computers in the house for a reason. Firstly, Django Unchained remembered us the hard life suffered by black people in the past, due to a great introduction without dialogues, where black people were unchained while they came back to be selling to an owner farm, it being matching with an amanzing soundtrack as identity Tarantino´s films. squash sport also can be played individually as two players together or in team of 4 players.squash one of the very nice attractive sports This town is located in the central zone of the Afghanistan with 4462(km²) space, and has more than seven Million populations, the economic and security situation is not suitable and these factors have directly effect in to the carefulness of environment.

You can go there to learn and to do research if you have to write a paper. You can rent movies, music, and books at your pleasure as long as you take care of them. Also, if you're just having a hectic day and need some peace and quiet, libraries become a perfect get away. But, heres the truth. Many people find certain things in libraries to be offensive and would rather them not be on the shevles. According to the information donne, the most used is the car thus most of the families has one, but the public transportation is getting more and more common for those ones who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectfully with the planet. My opinion is to let them stay. I believe that books are too important to throw out just because they @MONTH1 contain a few vulgar words or images. this country are many interesting pLaces to visit,if you wantto have adventure you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza.If you want to have fun you may go to parque de la Costa there are many interesting rolercoasters.And if you want to go the best museum of art in Argentina you should go to malba. Also, music is changing as the years go on and many people, especially elders, don't enjoy listening to this new style of music. Just because one person my find something offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will. People have many different views when it comes to these things. Take history for example. the actions of this film took place in Alexandrie city of Egypt and it talks about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they didn't have much money to produce their own albums , that sort of bands is   famous between the youth and they call it ""under ground bands "" .their songs give a big concenet to the political and social stituation in Egypt and they become famous after the25 january revoulation , why I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society , there is no chance for the youth and if they found it , they face lot of problems to save it and they didn't find time for other activties and in sometimes they worked in thing which  they never learn or love A song, book, or movie about slavery can cause some people to be offended. Whether it's because the person opposes slavery greatly or they believe that slavery was a good thing, people have different feelings towards it. Another good example is movies. MOTASSEM is nice and lovely fiance he love his job as he is Patient will dong has jop .he is  a  hard worker he has amazing laughs     .When you started  talk with him you will be inspire by his knowledge and his way of talk he have the talent to Convinces  thought. Additionally, many things that are found offensive to one person can make something more interesting to someone else. There are many movies nowdays that can be seen as very offensive. But honestly, the offensive things happening @MONTH1 just make someone else want to know more about what's going on. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately but he forget what he had to do after thinkig he rememebred that he had to visit his grandmother as she was ill and his mother told him that his grandmother wanted to see her doctor and wanted him to take her by his car as adoctor's clinic far from her house  peter decided to go and he drove his car to his grandmother's house in the next street after he arrived, he saw his grandmother was waiting for him on the front of the street he apologized to her and asked her to come to the car, ""never mind "" she told and ride the car beside him . Most of the organizations known how is affect managemant acountant practice on them work , therefore they are chossing good programme and employee. Even though in the end, I lfind them to be exceptionally books. It just on how you view it. So, should things that are found offensive to one person be removed from a library? The answer is no. There are just too many things that can be taken offensively. If you start taking away these things, libraries are only going to become vacant. Younger people will stop coming because materials will be less interesting. You will lose artifacts and stories about the history of the world. There will also only be so many books to read, if ever a non-offensive book could even be found. My advise to libraries, keep materials that can be found extremely offensive in their own area, away from younger people who @MONTH1 react strongly. Maybe even put a sticker on the book, if possible, letting people know just what they're dealing with"	4
581	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Benefits of Learning Variously

             Recently many kinds of fields have appeared, and the relationship between the fields has become more complex. many countries are truly started to concern no environment and worried about the globe warming ,In schools teachers are doing their best  to educate children how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy,also they train them how to plant trees in public gardens of their towns ,Although  government strict so many laws and taxes in the people how do not pay their taxes to the council for cleaning of the rubbish from towns and villages,in the biggest polluted city in the world people started to use bicycles and cycling instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city,also they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive. Nowadays, many students are wondering multiple disciplines are helpful or not. I believe that students have to take classes in many subjects for some reasons. Firstly, students can learn various ideas from many kinds of subjects. Each subject like mathematics or economics requires different kinds of ideas or abilities. For example, mathematics requires rigorous proofs; however, economics requires explanations based on real life. Each idea can be useful for each situation. Therefore, students who know various ideas from different kinds of subjects have the potential to deal with various situations. First of all, thank you professor to teach in the meantime, the entire course of the learn really benefited, especially in the first meeting, for British English, I still did not really understand, it makes me frustrated, but gradually after I found the beautiful of the language in British English, I think it’s all because of the usual problem of American English, and so I really appreciate that you choose simple  textbooks and it’s easy to learn, and you really very carefully and very humorous, you're always careful in curriculum pronunciation correction for each student, using a variety of reading skills let us immerse them read. Since working together is pretty frequent nowadays, building communication skills and the relationships between many other people in various fields is important. Attending many classes of various majors gives opportunities of communicating with other students from different majors to students. Consequently, students who take classes in many subjects will be able to work with other coworkers more smoothly. I do currently master but I can devote myself to the Fellowship Especially since I finished the Pre-Masters and now I need only follow-up from time to time with my guide Academic, so I have the time for the Fellowship . Many difficult problems like human disease can be solved with help of several fields. Moreover, people who know well in several fields can know a wider range of problems in this world. That is the reason why professors with various bases can find the topics of research easily. In conclusion, students who take classes in various subjects have the potential for becoming better workers and researchers. we all know that do sport is very important to keep our life healthy and happy.My favourite sport actually is walking;and I prefer walking in the morning and before sundown.I like also walking in public street,gardens,clubs and on the shore.when i want to go anywhere;I do my best to go on foot.I like this sport since my childhood because I found that I can think about my good time when I was child and relax with myself to think carefully about my present and future.The walking can also fitness and do the knee stronger.It would be interesting to accompain your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time.I advice my guys who suffer from laziness and overweight,try to walk one hour at least and after that they will like this sport. Hence, students should take classes in many subjects."	4

Moreover also simple things are changed, for example the food we eat: some times ago everythingh was natural, healthy... but now everyone eat always ""junk food"" and thinghs like that, which are completely unhealthy ! In fact, not only can someone download innapropriate content right onto their screen, they can also be inflicted upon with graphic words or view a website that involves videos with drug use. criminal acts, vulgar language and more. A recent study on internet use from the @ORGANIZATION1 for internet use includes that ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" has a history of a result to suicides or depression in teens. @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is a form of @CAPS5 where someone can chat or instant message someone and hurt their feelings. Not only is @CAPS4 @CAPS5 an issue, however, people can now talk to strangers on the internet. Think about how awful it would be if your child had given out their private information online and a man who said they were the same age as your child received it and lied about their age, sex, apperance, and age. Now that man can track your child down and possibly kidnap or hurt them. Secondly, the internet can also be very unhealthy and can create you to become less social. According to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of children or teenagers that result to internet use can create a weak relationship with friends and family members if they use the computer too much. It can be very unhealthy for someone, and not just teenagers, to use the computer for an extended amount of time than they should. People can gain the effects of laziness, little brain effort, and lose interaction with the outside world. And to day is necessary because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversation with their you need to now more than your foreign language, because in the rest of the world and particularly in Europe people now more than two language and that great. From my own experience, I used to stay up late for hours using websites such as @CAPS9 because everyone else was using it. Sure, it can be entertaining and fun but using the internet won't be so much ""fun"" when your academic grades are at risk and you stop communicating with the outside world. Adiction can draw anyone in against their willpower. Also, just for young children that are in process of growth and development, physical exercise is essential to do it, because they can have a healthier life.Young children try to effort, and wants to win at this age, and if they train results were better and encourages to keep training.In psychic way, if you are adapated forms relations and create new friends. You can get addicted to one subject until you lose everything else you have. In conclusion, we are assisting to a new tend in transport, every time, they are faster and more developer, with the latest technology included but at the oppossite case, we find also a contradiction, as we found an other trend for the tradictional transport which avoid the pollution in order to respect the Earth If technology becomes too powerful in our civilization, how can we learn to interact with our humanity. More and more peole become involved with technology and frankly it can be quite horrendous in my oppinnion."	4
583	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Taking Risks or Chances are Costs of Success
Nowadays, success in life can be achieved in two ways. Some claim that success can be achieved from taking risks or chances, while others claim that success results from careful planning. In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life, but majority of ones is totally utopic. First of all, prediction does not work these days. No one can predict precisely the world after 10 years or even 2 years. Even if some jobs seem promising, there is no guarantee that they are still symbol of success in the future. But now I really enjoyed, and me best friend both for me ticket for a theatre to see the musical show ,which was amazing, for cuople of hours I didn't move, was a brilliant present. In addition to impossibility of prediction, taking risks or chances can result in huge success. Being a pioneer or a leader of some department is easier with taking risks; moreover, taking risks is easier way to follow new trends. Apple bet their future in a smartphone, which is new invention, and became one of the biggest IT companies in the world. first we uses Internet to discover the world's news, from Internet we can check and read world's most famous newspaper such as new York times, the sun and also electronic newspaper.Internet also can be used to learn and to educate yourself, internet allow us to read books, magazines and short stories.Internet is the most effective way to start a business and to look for a job, many people uses Internet to work , and they earning money every month.Internet is a way to make new friends all over the world through social websites such as Facebook,twitter, and you tube.As a conclusion internet is making things better and easier, life now is always connected to the Internet. Some argue that planning can help people what to do exactly; however, that can make people caught by plan. Sometimes, the plan can be written by overestimation. For example, some decided to start drawing and then make 12 artworks per year, but they can be impatient if working speed is not fast enough. It is not only harmful for health but also the quality of the works. If people just trying new method of drawing, they are more likely to success. To sum up, taking risks or chances is a qualification of success in life. Because the prediction has low precision, it is better to take risks and invest in new part that no one has considered. Not fearing the failure is the key word for the success nowadays."	4
584	Government: Some people think that governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology. Other people disagree and think that this money should be spent on more basic needs. Which of these opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"As the modern technology has developed from 20th century, the importance of computer technology also has been increased. many countries are truly started to concern no environment and worried about the globe warming ,In schools teachers are doing their best  to educate children how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy,also they train them how to plant trees in public gardens of their towns ,Although  government strict so many laws and taxes in the people how do not pay their taxes to the council for cleaning of the rubbish from towns and villages,in the biggest polluted city in the world people started to use bicycles and cycling instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city,also they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive. Even some claim that government should spend as much money as possible for it. However, the government should not spend a lot for computer technology for three reasons. First of all, there are lots of basic science fields which must be developed; for example, physics and chemistry. Those fields need more budget, and people who have studied in the basic science fields have claimed that the government should spend more money on basic science. According to the statistics from OECD, the investment of the Korean government for the basic science is 56th out of 150 conturies. Considering that Korea is an advanced contury, that result is too nonsense. Even the basic sciences are the necessary ones for developing computer technology. Instead of spending much money only for computer science, making investment to the basic science would show much better results. In addition to the investment for basic sciences, securing a budgeet for welfare also necessary. Recently, the gap between rich and poor is more and more increasing. It is not the only welfare problem and there exist too many problem in Korean society such as the price of real estimate, education fee, and employment difficulties. Even though do not everyone doing that,so how much public office is care of environment is important and this town is care of that a lot.Every morning some peasons are coming park and cleaned that makes feel really thanksgratitude. My advice of finding work, is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work.But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase. The computer is not the main soure of trade profit. Also, even if the government tries to develop computer science, it would be difficult to profit because there already exist too strong computer enterprises like Intel, Microsoft, and Google. To sum up, the government should not spend a lot for computer technology. The reasons are simple. Firstly, staff and Personnel design the background colour , the artwork and the scuriity issues on the bank notes,which is also  done in process of other card,such as notes for supermarket.Then in the preparation process, skilled machinists prepare of metal plates for printing.After that sheets of bank notes are printed,there are differences and specials for it, it use special ink ,and print colors on both side,images are slightly rised. Ultimately, it is too difficult to make money with computer technology since that filed already became a red ocean a few decades before. What it means is that it is time to consider and solve the basic needs."	4
585	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"To: The @ORGANIZATION1 can be a big part mof people's lives, however, some don't realize the negative effect these pieces of technology have. Secondly, it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting a time in waiting a specific time to move or even waste a time in waiting a public transportation to reach all point it should get it , but in the other side when  you have your own transport or a private transport is get a right to choose time of trip or when you want to move or stay, and nowadays we cannot waste our time in taking public transport. Secondly, anyone can post information on a website, therefore, it can be inaccurate. Lastly, people tend rely on computers too much. Computers are negatively impacting our society! most of girl doesnt like this,i think that it takes us energy,we need to do exercise,reasonable diet...and so on. For example, if you are playing games on the computer for hours, it can strain your eyes. This can cause you to feel tired and drowsy after being on the computer. Also, statistics show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own computers. Could this be the cause of obesity in @LOCATION1? Computers could very well be restricting people from wanting to go outside and excercising to maintain a healthy lifestyle and weight. Computers are obviously unfit for our bodies in many ways. Have you ever wondered if the information on a website is completely accurate and true? I know I have. Anyone who has access to a computer can post information on a blog, website, or communication site (such as twitter, facebook, or myspace). Not everyone who posts articles is an expert on that topic; the information could very well be false! More and more @CAPS1 use computers to get the information they need, which could, in the long run, be hurting them. Books are much more accurate! They have to be revised by editord, and are written by people who definitely know what they're talking about! If you are living in big town or small It does matter but one thing should be taking care by the people and organiser of the town, is environment.Global warming  is huge issue in today's date. Lastly, computers have a negative effect because we rely on them too much! For example let's say you are writing a paper on the computer that is due tomorrow. You save it, and then close down the computer because you have to go eat dinnder. Later, you come back to the laptop to find that your paper isn't there anymore! You look all over your folders; but it's gone. Computers always have technical glitenes, but you don''t always have time to go to the tech help store to fix it. However, if you had written out the paper, it wouldn't have randomly disappeared! @CAPS4 people depend on computers too much, it can backfire and cause a @CAPS3 problem for you. This book made me interesting and I begging reading more and more while I read the more I love it  this time everything  did not matter to me I want to finish the book  as soon as possible I do not know the end but I want the end of the book was amazing but the same time I do not finish the book because the mystery to open up finished in. I worked hard all night to get it done. so, on my opinion, even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers But I think that the future is the public transport, we need preserve nature, this is an imperative for our world, then the solution have to take the point that the governments do more invest in public transport, so the people don´t need to get a car for being able to have a job and don´t need it for normal development of their lives. Computers have a big negative effect on society because we tend to depend on them too much. In conclusion, computers are hurting our society, clearly, they are unhealthy for our bodies. Also, the information on the computers internet might be naccurate. But I think that the future is the public transport, we need preserve nature, this is an imperative for our world, then the solution have to take the point that the governments do more invest in public transport, so the people don´t need to get a car for being able to have a job and don´t need it for normal development of their lives. I strongly believe we should recluce our dependence on computers!"	4

I firmly believe that computers are necessary in our society. @CAPS2, @CAPS3! I miss you!"" are the words @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1-year-old @PERSON1. @PERSON1 has been working overseas for two years in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3. One @ORGANIZATION1 the only ways she can contact her father is through @ORGANIZATION3. Communication is extremely important in our society; it brings families and friends closer together. Computers provide a variety @ORGANIZATION1 forms @ORGANIZATION1 communication, such as @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS5, and instant messaging. ""@ORGANIZATION3"" allows people to have what can be called a ""visual phone conversation."" A teary-eyed @PERSON2 says, ""@CAPS4 since @CAPS7 wife died, @CAPS7 daughter has been @CAPS7 only companion. With @ORGANIZATION3, I can not only hear her voice every day but see her face, too. One day I visit my friend Jimmy in New York city, he was a young man who was specialist on trains and tourism, he talked about how the citizens and the commuters move from one place to another, he told me that the grand central terminal was the largest terminal of the city,he show me were the landmarks of the big apple were so sightseers could go,he show me the city and we went to different parts first he took me to Columbus circle in the south west corner of central park were there were the most expensive apartments then we went to the lake were the jogging tracks that circle the lake area popular with early morning visitors,then we went to the museum of natural history that was located near the metropolitan museum of art then I got focal on the subway trains so we went to Grand central terminal when we arrive I was amazed to see many people going to work so he told me that it was conveniently for people to use the train because is very fastest and for the government it was a grat economic business then he told me that one of the characteristics of @CAPS5 and instant messaging also give out society fast, easy communication with others. This is terrible, you do not have privacy authought the society have a blame, because if they do not take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored. Therefore, computers are very important for communication in our society. While I were in ANDRAPRADESH every year we have Christmas function in December although we are not interested to attend Drama they were not leave us without participation even simple character.They gave me a character like THE GOD .Firstly I never aware about how act and do this particular character.And from October to till December we practise everyday after our study hour up to eleven ""O""CLOCK.DAY BY DAY  I learn and finally I did my role well.Then I think myself why I wasted all my school days . Computers provide an excellent variety @ORGANIZATION1 education in our society. For example, toddlers and children can use programs such as @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS6). @CAPS6 programs teach reading, writing, and speaking to children. This afirmation: travelling by car is so much more convenient say everything, for example if we think a lot of time we spent on wait bus to arrive our destiny, the traffic is a lot of things that everyone prefer  buy car it more practical and fast. I couldn't be more proud."" Computers don't only teach children; they teach adults, too! Did you know that adults learn @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 their knowledge about the environment, politics, and other basic information from the computer? Computers are needed to help people learn in our society. Finally, computers teach balance. A @LOCATION1 mom says, ""@CAPS7 teenager @PERSON4 has learned how to balance computer and life, and I can definitely see how it connects to other areas @ORGANIZATION1 balance as well."" @CAPS10 teenagers learn to balance their computer time, they also learn how to balance, extra-curricular activities in school. This shows, as a result, that students actually learn responsibility from computers. I hope that our society will consider the fact that computers are necessary. @CAPS10 they provide commonication, teach education, and help kids learn how to balance, what do we have to lose? Computers can most certainly improve our society."""	4

"Letter to the @CAPS1 I disagree with the so-called ""experts"" that claim that computers could have negative effects on people. The idea that you socialize less with family and friends is a pathetic arguement. The future of public transport in developed countries is very different, because most people have a car, in   the people who live in poor countries, most people take public transport, because people doesn´t have a car and is cheaper take public transport, the pollution of public transport is huge and is growing third world countries should have, eco friendly transport. Twiter is good when you just want to say something quick like ""@CAPS5 to @LOCATION1"". @CAPS18 allows you to talk to friends, comment on their videos, and subscribe to them, plus it provides hours of entertainment without a fee. Computers also can provide fun games and entertain users. There are many free games, like @PERSON1, that have endless possibilities. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 (made by @CAPS6) claims to be the most popular @CAPS7 (@CAPS8 @CAPS9 Online @CAPS10-playing @CAPS11) on the web. We're looking for a new nice home and so we are truly interested to keep your place tide and take care about it as it were our own. Or you can level up skills like wood cutting, prayer, farming, fishing, mining, and cooking. @PERSON1, like most @CAPS4, has quests, with varying difficulties. For example, for one quest you have to kill a demon, but for another, just find a missing cat. There are over @NUM1 quests, and there are never fewer than @NUM2 people playing at a time. Some other notable @CAPS13 games are @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS14: @CAPS15, @CAPS16 of @CAPS17, @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION2, and @ORGANIZATION1. As you can see, the computer has an impressive list of entertaining @CAPS11 for all ages, not to mention sites like @CAPS18 or addicting games. Computers don't really affect exercising. That's a personal choice, so you have to choose between @CAPS2 or the basketball court. It's like saying that before we had computers or video @CAPS11 consoles, that a @CAPS20 board stopped kids from exercising. The computer doesn't actually stop us from exercising. It's our minds that do, and our judgement. If you have bad judgement, you'd stay inside all day tweeting and @CAPS21. The most important step is inspect the notes which are good quality sheets and which are bad sheets.If the sheets are good,those sheets are then cut into separately and packed into cars in order to dispatach all over the city.If the sheets are bad,those sheets are then destroyed through burning. All it takes is good judgement. Just to recap what I've said, @CAPS22 is plenty on computers and there are many choices on how to do it. And the strengths and weaknesses in both of segmental and suprasegmental, I think it’s maybe the learning habit, when I heard a sentences, I would use many varieties of tone and manner to say the sentences again, therefore,I can easily be interpreted illustrations instructions the emotions and feelings. Not to mention you can buy games like @CAPS16 of @CAPS17 or @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS14: @CAPS15 for your @CAPS13! This experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister (I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money."	4

"Dear Readers' @ORGANIZATION1 the Local Newspaper, I am almost certain you interact daily with computer. You use computers to write, play games, look at pictures, and print work out. There are dozens @ORGANIZATION1 practical for computers but nowadays, many people, especially children, are using computers excessively. This unnecessary usage @ORGANIZATION1 computers can cause obesity, expose children to mappropriate things & destroy family time. Readers, hear my arguement and by the end @ORGANIZATION1 the paper you will surely agree with me that computers are detrimental to society. Have you ever made a @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to lose weight? It's not uncommon for one to make such a goal. According to the @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 adults make their @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to get in shape, exercise nore or just lose weight. We've all seen the commercials on @CAPS4 that encourage you to ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 you too can ""lose weight in just one week""! There are also plenty @ORGANIZATION1 entrepenuers out there that want to convince you to buy their exercise product @CAPS7 you can develop outrageously large muscles in ""no time at all"". Most importantly,manually inspected on each printed sheet in case that there would exist damaged sheets.Once damaged sheets are discovered, partically separate them into good and bad ones and them burn the bad notes,making sure that the remaining sheets are of good quality . I love to work in the summer camp job to make the exercise every shop in usa should make the summer camp job , I am the right person to work because I'm very exercise and I' love to work in the kitchen, because i am the right chief in the summer camp job. The students at @LOCATION1 had one group @ORGANIZATION1 people try a regular commercial diet plan & another group @ORGANIZATION1 people do exactly what they've been doing... Except their computers. They found that the group who from computer use lost nearly @PERCENT2 more weight on average them the group on the comercial diet! Nothing is causing obesity in @LOCATION2 them computer. A familier day for an average child in @LOCATION2 goes like this: go to school, home on the bus, use computer eat dinner, do homework, go to bed. I like to play football cause for me, as well as one hobby, is one way to stand out of the world, of the problem that every day I have to face, and at the end it makes me calm and happy. Readers please, try avoiding you computers for just one week, and you can forget those jet plane. Another negative @ORGANIZATION1 computers is that it not only affects an individual but possildy an entire family! Many children can go an entire day without sitting down & talking to their parents. My friend @PERSON1 often hope from school and goes straight up to to use his laptop without even saying hello to his parents. Computers have become nearly an addiction to most teenagers. @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION1 teens in @LOCATION2 say they use computers daily & @PERCENT4 say they have trouble communication with their parents. There is a direct connection between the lack @ORGANIZATION1 communication at home for teens & computer usage. firstly, that private transport provide a comfortable mean to travelling from one place to another without sharing stranger people a way and by using this kind of transport also comfortable in free with choosing time of a trip. What they don't notize is that they're totally forgetting about their families! Recently when I was in youtube I saw a movie trailer, the film appeared so good and days later my friends told me if I wanted to go them to the cinema, so I decided to go and luckily they had decided to see the film that days before I had seen. Some teens don't have that luxury. Computers have the ability to destroy parent-child relationships, don't let that happen to you. However,the family is near you since the day you were born until forever.The members follow you,and can based on them.You can tell whatever you want to them.For example,if you are in a bad mood the first person that will come next to you,to make you smile is your mom or dad.Mom and dad spent their life to grow up their children,to feed them,to love them! From the time they were your children probably had a keyboard at their fingertips. Do parents ever realize what they're getting their children into when they teach them how to use a computer though. Children as young as @NUM2 or @NUM3 years old are exposed to profamily, & vulgar pictures on the web on supposed ""safe sides"". Do you even realize who your child's talking to on the computer? With all the @CAPS8's & emails flying around, you could be talking to a complete stranger without-even knowing. An enormous part @ORGANIZATION1 who your child become & the values they hold is a product @ORGANIZATION1 what they were exposed to @ORGANIZATION1 a young age. Bring a computer to your kindergartrer & you can probably guess what they'll grow up with. No matter how much you think or believe on the safety @ORGANIZATION1 computer, you cannot argue with the fact that computer expose children to adult content very early in their lives. @CAPS7 do you look at your computer differently @CAPS6? Recently when I was in youtube I saw a movie trailer, the film appeared so good and days later my friends told me if I wanted to go them to the cinema, so I decided to go and luckily they had decided to see the film that days before I had seen. Think a head @NUM4 years from @CAPS6. However if this situation not change and if our government not take providence about this important subject will be the end of the transport public and will more convenient to use car. In the end, the choice is really up to you."	4
589	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Smoking in all restaurants in the country should really be banned. If you are living in big town or small It does matter but one thing should be taking care by the people and organiser of the town, is environment.Global warming  is huge issue in today's date. Some smokers smoke in restaurants because it is their habit to smoke after meals. Some customers just smoke and smoke and do not care about the other customers. Negaticvs about the online lerning are dat your not listening to much from ea real person and more from a Computer, if you dont have any listening things in the app you dont lern how to pronounce the words. We can get different kind of diseases in it. If one smoke in a restaurant, the smoke can spread there thus people will breathe and smell it. The chemicals in the smoke can also be breathed. With that, many types of diseases can be spread by this second hand smoke. It may cause lung cancer, heart disease and other respiratory diseases. Some people also get dizzy when they smell cigarette smoke. Cigarettes may also cause fire when not disposed properly. Restaurants should make a law regarding smoking cigarette. Travelling by car is much more convenient but all know really there is no future for public transport.When we talk about public transport,there are many people and everyone travel but i think we do not feel relax are there and if we talk about travelling by car.It is the best or much more convenient for us.Because we can travel any where but in public transport we can not travel to any other sites They should put no smoking signs inside so that smoking customers will not smoke. Restaurants can also build smoking area so that smokers can have a place for smoking. A fine may also be an effective way to avoid customer dissatisfaction."	4
590	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?

"The library is meant to be a place that is filled with materials of all different genres and types. Obesity and other thins about help, is a topic very important because the people is dying for this problem.For example, the form to prepare the food, is gonna be dangerous because a lot food have artificial thing that is no good for us. Although some materials that people need to research at the library @MONTH1 be considered inapproproate for certain audiences, it still serves as a useful resource for others. This @MONTH1 include getting information for a research paper, renting a movie that needs to be watched for school, or looking for a certain type of book to read. By taking certain books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves, we are limiting the amount of materials for people to borrow. At many schools, students are asked to write research papers. What is considered a valid subject for a high school research paper @MONTH1 include information that is not suitable for all groups of people. A student @MONTH1 write a research paper on the effects a certain drug has on an individual. Just because the student chooses this topic, does not mean that he or she supports it. Some adults @MONTH1 say that information on drugs should not be on the shelves in a library because it @MONTH1 include material that they consider graphic, but a student looks at this material only as a resource for an educational purpose. In modern life,we rely on traffic to work or travel to everywhere.It is conveninet to travel by private cars .The price of private cars which every one can afford it,so that everyone has the private car nowadays .Some people point out private cars are going to replace the public transport . We also watched the movie to get a better understanding of the differences between our time periods. There is death and violence in the movie, along with a brief flash of nudity. Many would consider even this great literary work as a movie inappropriate. The movie helped us to get a real life picture of how things were back then. We were mature enough to look past the graphic scences and see the movie for what it really was. While I were in ANDRAPRADESH every year we have Christmas function in December although we are not interested to attend Drama they were not leave us without participation even simple character.They gave me a character like THE GOD .Firstly I never aware about how act and do this particular character.And from October to till December we practise everyday after our study hour up to eleven ""O""CLOCK.DAY BY DAY  I learn and finally I did my role well.Then I think myself why I wasted all my school days . Sometimes, we just want a good book to read. Many teens gravitate to the young adult section because it includes age-related material. Many books in this section @MONTH1 include works that have a dark or graphic theme with subjects that are inappropriate for younger children. If we eliminated books from this section because they are being censored, we will end up with even less teens that read. Certain books provide an escape for some teens, and @MONTH1 even help them to confront or deal with problems in their own lives. If libraries start censoring books we @MONTH1 end up with less and less readers as the years go on. Instead of censoring the books, we should censor the people reading the books. I strongly believe that grammar is not the most important element to speak English, if you know grammar you only know certain rules to write, but I think that speaking is most important than writing, because when you go to anyplace in the world, you have to be prepared to talk and understand whatever they say to you; in this part you may notice that if you don't know vocabulary, you wouldn't unsderstand anything; but here is another topic, whether you understand or not, you have to notice the way that people talk to you, and try to realize what the person is trying to say. Libraries can put age approval marks on certain books to permit only certain age groups to read them.

No matter what a person's purpose for reading is, they should have a choice of what kind of material the book contains."	4

"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do people benefit from the use of computers. Some say that using computers rather than exercising and being outside is a bad thing. I personally believe that the use of computer technology is a good thing. The gym has many problems that we are gouing to explain : the first problem is that we don´t have enough aparatous for all of the students  the second problem is about that same aparatous are not working well because the school didn´t the manteinace long time ago For the first problem in my opinion , the school have to buy some others aparatus because there are not enough for all of the students For the second problem the solution for me is to hire someone to do the maintenance and say to all of the students to take care of the machines of the school I hope my proposal wiil be useful for you I look forward to hearing from you soon Sebastián Ferrari The use of computers teach hand-eye cordination and reaction time. Some say that being outside and exercising is better than using a computer but many computer games help hand-eye cordination. Alter playing computer games more and more the time it takes for you to react to the game you are playing and hit the mouse button is very important. These skills could help you in the activities you take part in and every - day life, personally, I play a lot of @CAPS3 @NUM1, a computer gaming system. @CAPS3 has helped ny hand-eye cordination greatly and it has shown in the four sports that I play. Clearly, Computers can be very helpful and can help your hand - eye cordination. Computers can also help people learn in many ways. Today, we have more item to recycle as long as we clean properly and put in a proper bin, which will be use it by specialized factory in another item. The ability to learn about foreign countries is a big part in learning as a student. I use the internet nearily every night to type my papers and find the information that I need. It has helped one as a student. Also, typing papers on computers is becoming the new @CAPS4 of hand writting. Teachers are beginning to require that school work is typed on a computer and printed. But, on the other hand, because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable; cars are so many; very noisy, unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth. Following your letter , I want to tell you about The apartment is very Beautiful not big or small medium-sized left inside two rooms, a bathroom and a dining hall and an external director categorize overlooking a beautiful view I am sure he will like it  to come and Tri condo b soon ,n the end, I would say that I miss you too much and I hope to see you soon. Many people have calenders in their computers that send you reminders on your schedule. Your computer is also where your data like music and pictures can be saved. Computers are also very useful for learning and organizational purposes. The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots. People use computer technology to communicate everyday through @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and I-chat. If I need to know what our homework is or when practic is I use my computer to ask someone for the answer. Before I began communicating with my computer talking to others was much harder to do. Although many disagree with using computer technology, computers are often the way we communicate with foreign countries. When something happens overseas the first way we found out about it is a computer. It is essential for us to use computers to communicate with other nations. Clearly computers are importan for communication purposes, we must continue to use computers for multiple reasons. Although many disagree with the use of computers, there hand - eye, communications, and learning purposes are very important. However, compared to the line of indoor swimming pool,the difference of seasonal achievement of ice cream van is considerably large.Overall,the achievement of ice cream van is better than the indoor swimming pool,from about 1100 to 5500. It is up to you to continue using computers."	4
592	"Government: Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.        "	"Investing Space Industry in Government

Space industry has kept developing since mankind first stepped on the moon. Various countries still invest massive amount of money on space industry; for example, U.S. spent 10 billion dollars for exploring outer space on 2020. (ref I) Despite the opinion that the budget for exploring outer space is a waste of money, governments should keep investing on space industry for two reasons. Most of the organizations known how is affect managemant acountant practice on them work , therefore they are chossing good programme and employee. The technology for exploring outer space has widely applied to daily life. Actually, we have a lot of problem with traffic: lots of cars in the railway and it don't running; the number of cars in the street cause a dirty pollution;  crawded railways causes a later destination. By allocating the budget for outer space, the life on Earth can be improved efficiently. In addition to advanced technology, the space industry enables alternative dwelling options for future. Total population has increased exponentially, and it is reported to exceed 500,000,000 in ten years. (ref III) Outer space can be good alternatives for Earth to afford massive populations; for example, Mars are planned to be developed for future residence in SpaceX. (ref IV)
Although the space industry gives various benefits, some argues that the space industry is waste of money. In conclusion, the governments spend plenty of money on space industry to improve the life in present and future. The technologies in space industry are not only useful for outer space, but also necessary for daily life. The investment of governments should be increased gradually to lead the technology."	4

     My university KAIST is known as a school which has a brilliant student and an academic system. In fact, most students in KAIST that are including me are satisfied with an overall life of the university. Most people may think that there are nothing for KAIST to change. My advice of finding work, is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work.But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase. In my opinion, if I could change one important thing about KAIST, then I want to change things about the school cafeteria. There are three reasons why I hope to change the school cafeteria. First of all, the qualities of food are low. But she is boyfriend live upstate and hasn’t got a airport he’s of city because of that she was need choose by train. Despite the price, the tastes are not so good. For example, the fried food is too greasy, and for some cases, meals are not cooked well. Second, there are too many restaurants related to snacks, not meals. Most of the KAIST students live in dormitories, so they often eat lunch at a school cafeteria. However, there are a variety of cafeteria about salad, hamburger, or sandwiches. Foods of these stores are just simple snacks, so students who want to eat meal and to feel full should go to a specific cafeteria. Then the places are so crowded, and they have to be waiting for lunch for a long time. Third, the condition of school cafeteria is not clean as much. For example, when I ate lunch at a school cafeteria, the hair and some unsatisfied things are found. These things make students feel worse, and even cause them to have a stomachache. This book made me interesting and I begging reading more and more while I read the more I love it  this time everything  did not matter to me I want to finish the book  as soon as possible I do not know the end but I want the end of the book was amazing but the same time I do not finish the book because the mystery to open up finished in. I think that it would be better if KAIST changes the overall cafeteria system."	4

"I think that the  public  transport always going to be so important in our life  because  not all the people have the possibility to buy a car because the public transport is more expensive than a car, so for that reason the public transport in the future  could be exist, because public transport is a necesity in all the world not only for the money but too for the facility to take a bus or any other public transport People who reach 18 have to complete military service is an issue, the supporters suggest that is helpful for the 18 to train the physical fitness and psychological quality, whilst opponents point out that is harmful for the human right and affect development of the country. Let me explain my reasons, when you drive your car you can take it from your garage or in the main door of your house and it gets you whatever you want, but on the other hand if you take public transport it will be much more uncomfortable because you must catch the bus in the bus stop... where is your nearest bus stop? As we are fully depending on the indivitual generators ,that are causing multiple problems in he weather dueto it's smoke, the oil and gass left behind , in addition to sound offcourse that are themain source for the 18 countinous hours noise. In todays society computers are vital and getting rid of them would be like stopping oxygen from making its way to the body, being accompanied by multiple severe consequences. First and foremost, about @PERCENT1 of all modern companies require their employees to work on computers. These works of art aren't just handy-dandy toys , rather @CAPS5 essential to the working class @CAPS5 a # @NUM1 pencil to a student taking a cut. Espesialy there are a lot of greens these makes good health.However someone have to take care of them.The town have to do that and I think in England there are so many greens all around,so a lot of people take care of these that makes good environment.After I have been to live in England with my family I have goton the feel very much indeed. ""@CAPS2 company designs software and uses computers @NUM2. Many of @CAPS2 employees work from home and have to own computers."" The growth of computers is not something to be frowned upon, rather an achievement in technology enhancing the lives of others. By ripping our computers from lives of workers chaos would be created with many unappealing consequences. Adults aren't the only ones whose jobs consists of computers. Nowadays students' homework is mostly online, computers decrease the amout of time needed to write an essay and are glare to students of all ages, @PERSON4, an eighth grades at @ORGANIZATION1, is an example of this dilema. Every night she has at least three hours of homework and usually one hour be @CAPS1 requires a computer, however, this isn't a problem because @CAPS1 cuts back the time @CAPS1 takes for @PERSON4 to do her homework. She can quickly type up an @CAPS3 essay or research a science topic instead of doing @CAPS1 painstakingly slow using an old fashion method. Moreover, computers are doors into the real world, especially for residents of @LOCATION1. Whether some people like to believe @CAPS1 or not, @LOCATION1 is a bit of a sicludded area where people aren't aware of what is going on outside of their closed off town. Computers cause news to spread like electricity and open @LOCATION1 residents eyes to national and global problems @PERSON2, another student at @ORGANIZATION5, states, "" @CAPS4 the earthquake took place in @LOCATION3 @CAPS2 friends and I were all at lunch, @CAPS5 we came back to class @CAPS2 teacher was projecting the news via her computer onto the white board"" @CAPS6 computers were taken away a stream of knowledge would be cut off from adults and children. Most importantly, computers create communication between friends and family calling up to talk to someone isn't always an option, so computers are the better choice. Families can connect with each other no matter @CAPS6 they have cell phone reception or what area of the world they are in, @PERSON1 is a senior at @LOCATION1 @CAPS7 @ORGANIZATION1 who agrees. ""@CAPS4 I go to college next year I am going all the way to @LOCATION2 and want to be able to talk to @CAPS2 family, via email and instant message I can contact them even @CAPS6 its inconvenient because they don't have to respond right away."" @PERSON1 brings up a good point computers serve the luxury of communication, which is vital to keep @PERCENT2 of healthy relationships, @CAPS5 shows a study at @ORGANIZATION4. In conclusion, computers are an incredible piece of equipment that should be valued and not taken away. The are vital to workers and students and bring news to residents of any corner of the world. Computers also are how friends and family are able to stay connected and communicate. Therefore, I urge you, readers of the @ORGANIZATION2, to raise your voice about the benefits of computers, so they aren't taken away from our society."	4

"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a huge thing now adays. Almost everyone has one that they use. But why do some people think that it is hurting our society. This isn't right because you need it for education, people aren't on all day, and a job. So how could those things be harmful to society. Your right they can't. Every single person has had some type of education. But how can you have an education with out a computer. If you rae working and you need to get another degree for your job. You can't go during the day so you can find a school that has online schooling, for at night. I just finish my lunch time, and before prepare everything to go to work I was thinking of you and I wanted to give you a small surprise with this fantastic photos, I hope you like it. Another reason why is that a school project or essay. You might need the computer to search up things for a project. Or cite your sorces. In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that doesn't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used,so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground. No computers no education and you will go and works at @CAPS1 or something. Where you don't need an education. In addition, stress is a clear disadvantage of compete because competitiors are trying to win and this can frustrates.But, some people do not think this like this and take it more simply Finally, I think that to compete in sports has some benefits and disadvantages, but when is controlated there are some benefits that help you to whole you life. Nothing at all. Every month Huang Ji Huang always make a special offer from their cutomer , and for this month Huang Ji Huang will give 20% discount for customer who spend 500 IDR above, for a complete  informatioj you can check it on the website or call the restaurant. They go on the computer to check e-mails, play games, look at facebooks/myspaces. But they have enough responcibility to go out and get fresh air. And if they sit in side then it isn't your problem because it is their life and they want to live it their way. Not the way everyone else wants them to. They can make choices for thier self and don't need others, to do it for them. So it really shouldn't effect you at all. What if at you job you need the internet. Most office people have a computer to talk to others by e-mail or to fix problems. People who work at about need the computer to access your account to get your money. Someone was calling the door while that someone was stealing in your house... By that, her sister is scared and woke up...  Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake The video games are a perfect example because the programers use a computer to porgram what you want to happening the game and thet takes hours to complete. I like going to the cinema, get out with my friends,  to playing the counter strike, walking to the park, going the shopping and can't stand watching the blood. Education, people aren't on all day and a job are really good reason that computers should becept. So everyone I strongly encourage you to reconsider what could happen without computers."	4

"IN my country peole do alot of mistake and have alot of of bad habits concerning their attitude towards the rubbish ,they are always throwing their old things and rubbish in public place ,the governement also cannot do their role towards their people and their bad behaviour Coat of arms of the city of Rybinsk is a scarlet heraldic shield,over which - green with golden beach pier for which the output is black rebelling bear holding in the left leg on the left shoulder golden ax, undertwo silver starlet I do believe that it benefits society even though many people dont. Nine out of @NUM1 schools use computers on a daily basis and their community is still fine. I know you think its taking away real social time but it really is improving the community. I used my car every day however few a few I started to take public transport for I can to save up money Travelling by using any transport has become in one of our needs, in the past people used to take hours waiting for the public transport, now, we can afford any of those modern car at the agency. There are many coordination games on the internet, like pinball of @CAPS1, that help build that up. When you play those games you keep your hand on the mouse or keyboard and your eyes on the screen. It helps you to not look down. When you play basketball, you can catch the ball and still throw it if you have good coordination. out of @NUM1 people keep in touch with family or friends online. Its the greatest feeling when you talk to someone you haven't seen in awhile because you know that they still remember you. When you talk to people online, you get to know them better and they tell you things that they dont want others to know. Also, when you meet up with them, you have more things to talk about. What would happen if you were to go to a location that you thought was nice, but it turned out to be the worst place ever? It would be terrible, but if you looked it up on the internet, you would know the truth about it. other people prefer to travel by trains as it's faster and more comfortable than cars.Many countries like to travel by bikes in order to decrease the pollution which happened by car exhausted.to my point of view i prefer travelling by cars which is more comfortable. when am in the court other side participants are fear take off my service ball and am very at my position to cover the entire court. I do agree with you on one thing. Society is losing its communication skills. Being on the computer all the time isn't doning anyone good. Nobodys picking up the phone and calling their friends to talk. They are distancing themselves from everyone but their computer. We dont want out society to stay this way. The people who spend their day on the computer need to change. I think computers are an asset to the community. Many people believe that computers are ruining everything, but they really aren't. Computers are good for learning about people and places. The question is, do you want people to refrain from using computers? Now is the time to decide, do you want us to use computers to furter our education or not?"	4

A library where there are no books to lose one's self in the pages. Good day, My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport, Volleyball one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to practise  this sport 3 times a week since 1980,  the reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as follows : 1- make me fit and healthy  2- classy game no friction between players  3- it exercise all muscles of your body Regarding the above I advice all rookies to start practise this sport and they will get many benefits. A library where works of literature such as @ORGANIZATION1, To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, and @PERSON1 are not on the shelves awaiting students to dive into their pages. Some of the greatest books ever written are respected for their controversy and mind blowing ideas. Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice which is being taken over by modern technology. A number of children in the @LOCATION1 are unable to read at their appropriate grade level. This number is greatly increasing due to poor education opportunities, lack of interest in education, and lack of resources in the @LOCATION1. Reading is the fundamental basis for each and every school subject. It is proven that children who are successful readers are five times more likely to be overall more successful students. However, by censoring what books are allowed in a classroom and library we are taking away a child's chance to broaden their minds. We are also taking away books that @MONTH1 interest a child. Children are @PERCENT1 more likely to read a book that they are interested in. Allowing a child not to read a book, such as '@CAPS3 @CAPS4' is unpractical and harmful to the child. Transportation is very important in cities,villages as well as in sub-lines.Many people has no vehicles,they only depends on public transport due to some reasons.Any way in some cases,car is very useful to reach the destination very fast. A person not only has the right to the best education one can receive, they also have the right to read whatever they want. Books open up a child's mind to new places and adventures that they @MONTH1 not ever be able to experience in their lifetime. Books have the ability to broaden people's minds. Some of the most interesting and controversial books that challenge an individuals beliefs and thoughts are being taken off the shelves and no longer readily available to people. @LOCATION2 was founded on the basis of freedoms; freedom of speech, freedom of thought. Why should this freedom not apply to books? Why should any person be allowed to tell another person what you can and can not read? And why should these books be available to everyone through public libraries? Michael is a good boy and he always listen to his mother .on time Michael was very angry as he got a bad score in his test .when he was home his mother was cooking she asked him what is the wrong ? No one should be allowed to tell another person what they can and can not read. FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY´S all begins in 1981 when freddy fazbear's pizza open, the establishment it's a pizza restaurant but this pizza restaurant in had robots, in 1981 there were four animatronics and their names are Chica , Foxy, Bonnie and Freddy. No one should be denied the chance to learn. By censoring books in libraries throughout @LOCATION2, millions of children are being denied the chance to learn. We live in a world where televisions, computers, iPods, and cell phones can be found in most homes and in everyone's hands. Books are thought of as 'a thing of the past' and not up to speed with today's technology. for carreer has 80% under 26 years old students are taken it, for the age over 49 years old only has 20%people are taken; but if you counper interest, it is totoly different; for under 26 years old have only 10%; but for over 49 years old it has 70%. Censoring libraries discourage kids to read even more than they already are discouraged to reading. Kids do not want to be told what they can and can not read and by taking away the books they want we are supressing their minds. Censoring will only make them want to read less, and play on the computer more. Censoring in libraries is also a pointless and non effective method. Kids with internet access can look up almost anything on their home computers. The things they find on the internet will be more controversial then the majority of books that are being censored. A favorite book of many kids is the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series. I suggested to other people  first to understand yourself such as  what do you like, which is possible and than practice after every success However a child could go home and watch the movies or search the internet for something more controversial. Censoring is pointless because children have other ways of viewing things that would be censored in a library. Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice that is being taken over by modern technology. The service is very bad the drivers are very angry and stressed out these do not lead with cauition, in Toluca exist report of high rates of accidents by buses. the citizens in the town must participate in this , the citizen will take the responsibility for specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish into correct place and clean tree and plant more of it . Books can help a child overcome poverty, mental challenges, and violence everyday. The pages of books fill them with hope and give them courage to create a better future for themselves. The inspirational stories in books have inspired millions to achieve more then they thought possible. Censoring would take away the chances for our future generations to become inspired by these books. Censoring would only hurt our youth and the greatness that they can accomplish."	4

"@ORGANIZATION1, ore and more people use computers @DATE1, but this is not necessarily a good thing. This experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister (I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money. Also. Negaticvs about the online lerning are dat your not listening to much from ea real person and more from a Computer, if you dont have any listening things in the app you dont lern how to pronounce the words. Finally, spending too much time on the computer decrease the amount of time spent with friends and family. Firstly, spending too much time on the computer affects your activity level. The more time spent has on a computer, the less time a person has to do something active, like exercising @PERCENT1 of people spend more than @NUM1 @NUM2 hours on the computer per day, if @NUM3 or so hours were used to exercise or play a sport that number would decrease to @PERCENT2 according to a recent study. At first and important change is about eating prepared food that isn't healthy usually,its reason probably woman's life stile that is going to big change in the way that they don't like staying at home and spend their time to making food ,now they prefer to buy prepared good. The amount of spent on the computer has been shown to decrease activity level and effect the number of overweight and obese people everywhere. Let me explain my reasons, when you drive your car you can take it from your garage or in the main door of your house and it gets you whatever you want, but on the other hand if you take public transport it will be much more uncomfortable because you must catch the bus in the bus stop... where is your nearest bus stop? Also kids now stay up later on computers and lower then grades @CAPS5 doing so. More time spent on @CAPS1 or anywhere on the @CAPS2 means less time studying, which means lower grades. Kids in spent an average of @NUM3 @NUM2 hours on the computer each day, while kids spend @NUM6 @NUM2 hours each day. A student in @PERSON2 saw their grades improve from a @CAPS3+ to a @CAPS4+ just @CAPS5 spending less time on the computer and more. That studnet also felt more because they get more computer. This tests and quizzes. Computers clearly negative effect on grades and school work. I start this sport since I was 10 years old.where my father was playing this sport also,but he started it when he was more greater than me,He was about 30 years old.where squash is one of the games that can be played in any age,I love this game because I find it making exercise to all the body in the same time , we are running in small place moving hands in stretched and different ways in the same time you are working your mind in the same time so it need caring and quik thinkink, as much exercise you will find down the road . A student, @PERSON1, said that she, spent more time going out with friends now that computer isn't up all my time, @CAPS5 doing this, i have a better friendshhip with all my friends than before. ""A kid that uses the computer during all of the free time spends @PERCENT4 less time with friends than someone who usues it in moderation. Afmilies also suffer from this a swell. If a family member spends all their time on the computer, the other family members will have less of a relationship with them because they don't talk or do anything together an dwill likely not know what is going on i their life or if something is wrong. As you can tell, computers also have a negative effect on relationships with family and friends. The overuse of computers does nnot benefit society.

"I like to play football cause for me, as well as one hobby, is one way to stand out of the world, of the problem that every day I have to face, and at the end it makes me calm and happy. Some are even unfit for young eyes. There are many reasons that some will come up with for removing these books from their shelves, but I believe that no one, politician or artist alike, should have the right to put down someone else's work. There are definitely books in libraries that wouldn't be dreamt of being checked out by the ordinary person, but these books should not be put down. I don't believe that a person's work, which is instilled with hope, money, beliefs, and elbow grease should be removed from public. The people of my town try to plant plants in the centre or somewhere is too smoke, so they try to keep the air at recommended levels.on the morning a lot of people go on footto the work or to the school or ride a bike or they take the bus.The people try to move the local factories out of country where is less air polluted ,less smoke,less cars and more forests and plants. It is the truth that this has been done in the past to keep down rebellions and shifts in power, but nevertheless, I still disagree. For example, even today @PERSON1's @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is illegal to even have in @LOCATION1. Nowadays public transportation is included almost all around the planet, We can admit that the transport revolution has been plave  in the last century but due to the globalization and technological development, the transport sector is always in a continuos transformation: In the other hand we must remarque how the plane sector has been grown, currently is the most common way of transport for going away and that's also means than the shipping factory has decreaced deeply, in order to let the plane market blomm. As it has been for many centuries, the ability to publish a book means the ability to be remembered forever, and many people put their soul into the book they write. These books represent the ability to think freely, and if one is to remove books from society, then one is to remove free will and free thinking from society as well. This is accentuated especially in the dark psychological science fiction novel by @PERSON2, @CAPS3 @NUM1. This book is almost prophetic in the descriptions of future society from the perspective of a person from the @DATE1's, and almost totally accurate as to what would happen if one was to take books out of society, and was even censored itself for a long time. Of course, it conveys the extremist view of censorship, and probably won't happen in the near future, at least. It is, however, a dark omen of what is to come is censorship is freely given power. There are many views that one can have on a single topic, book, or idea. That doesn't mean, however, that if it is viewed as wrong it should be put down. This applies to music, movies, magazines, websites, and books alike. If one removes these from society in any form, then at a raw standpoint, they are removing a piece of flavor and individuality from society. If censorship is given free reign, even if it is simply over the 'extremist' or 'radical' ideals, then people will never have the full ability to learn from their mistakes and know what to do about the future, which will simply be history that will be repeating itself. Of course, it is not my viewpoint that governments should simply let terrorists and radicals spread their ideals as they please. Once one is proven to be a threat or menace to the public, then they should most definitely be taken into custody and convicted of their wrongs.There is no doubt in my mind that the law should be upheld, but it should not overextend its boundaries. Censorship, as a whole, is a helpful process for the benefit of the public, but all in all it removes the ability to see the raw, cold truths of life. This keeps some from ever learning how to be safe truly, and how to think and believe in their ideals. pain and gain  This movie is bases quote on quote on a ""true story"" buts obviously director michael bay know for the transformers franchise puts a lot of hollywood into this movie, its about a bodybuilder named daniel lugo who decides to kidnap a rich guy and make him sign away all of his properties, which obviously its not a great plan that backfires on him, and eventualy police get him. I'm not inciting a rebellion, but I truly do not believe that politics should rule over the artistic soul of the average man. That in itself is how society becomes self-destructive and loses its concern and connection with the world"	4
600	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Smoking is the act of inhaling and puffing out visible finely divided matter or vapor formed during combustion of dried tobacco leaves. Smoking just a single cigarette can cause hundreds of toxins to enter the body. Some of the toxins which are present in a cigarette stick are nicotine which is addictive and increases the level of cholesterol in the body; carbon monoxide which reduces the oxygen in the body and; tar is a carcinogen which is a substance that causes cancer which gets accumulated in lung air passages. If these are the toxins that enter your body, imagine what will happen if you smoke in a restaurant where there are families bringing their kinds, pregnant mothers and someone who has asthma. In this type of environment, if you smoke, there will be a lot of second hand smokers who will also inhale the toxins that is present in the fume of a cigarette. If a person in the restaurant has asthma, there is a high possibility that inhaling a cigarette's fume may trigger that person's asthma. Aside from that, if you smoke in a restaurant, it can also cause the second hand smokers ' cancer especially in the lungs, cardiovascular diseases, emphysema, vascular diseases and other obstructive lung diseases. This process involves five main stages.First,it should take some considerations in design,including background colour,artwork,security issues.Next,skilled machinists is prepared ,in which there are metal plates.Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet).Subsequently, the technical must be used specially for distinction,for example the colour printed on both sides,Special ink is used and imges slightly raised.After this,printed sheets will be inspected carefully.According to the quality of sheets,it will be two results.if the quality is good or the bank notes is partially damaged which can be used,it would cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and disoatched.while those bad sheets will be securely destroyed. As a conclusion, if you smoke inside a restaurant, not only the smoker will get the bad effects of smoking but also the people who are inside the restaurant. This attitude reduced enromous amount of smoke pollution from the pipes.Government policy changes help a lot for water preservation.Many factories follwing the regulations and not draining the harmful wastage in the water."	4
601	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you belive that the advances in our technology are not good for our society you must be misunderstanding computers have a positive affect on the people in our community by giving us well hand and eye coordination and giving us the ability to seek and find information to learn. The other matter is about our habit to eating food together with our family that were a custom in humanity life not just in our culture,but now because of hard and busy life ,we had to eat our meal  mostly days of a week. Hand and eye coordination is an important thing that helps us everyday. @CAPS2 new technology such as computers, can help us with that skill, we should use it. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""Computers do help us a lot; almost @PERCENT1 of active computer users do improve their hand and eye coordination just by using the computers for a small amount of time everyday."" after two days poleas sow some boody in crime scene the poles man ask them what did you do hear ? With this new technology, you can earn degrees and learn in a short period of time. My aunt got her @CAPS4 online about six months ago, and just because of that, got promoted at her job. Gaining valuable @CAPS3 online doesn't just go for adults but children as well. @CAPS2 they have a report on @CAPS5 or need some help on their homework, these new technologies are one of the most effective, fastest ways to learn and find information. @PERSON2, a doctor that specializes in @CAPS6 emotions/feelings says in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 last month that, ""in this new millenium, preteens and teenagers simply love the new advances in technology, and @CAPS2 we want them to learn, then we can take this tool and have them use it."" Computers are also a great way to communciate it's fast and easy. I have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, and we rarely get to see each other due to the distance, som we catch up by messaging each other by social netwroks or emails. It's even free, unlike the costly long distance calls. The communication is also great for businesses. A company can reach out and contact their customers to reschedule an appointment, give receipts, advertist and many other things. Computers are essential and effective techorlogy that are use by people around the country and world. They improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to gain @CAPS3 and education, and gives people opportunity to communicate with others. this is another great and useful step in our communities around the world."	4
602	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"That I want to say, is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb's in Spanish Languaje, just Imaging you the same but not in your native lenguaje. Firstly, he or she is able to earn some money using his or her own effort. Secondly, it does not take up too much responsibility nor time, and in ideal situations will not distract the too much from his or her main occupation as a student. Moreover, one is able to make friends in his or her working circle, and understand how to navigate the working world after graduation. Many students take up tuition assignments which are ad-hoc and easy to manage around their time-table, while others seek jobs during the week-ends or at night, after their lessons. Part-time jobs are usually popular with people who have other more serious commitments, but have some spare time in which they would like a change in environment, or earn some money. Personally, I have worked as a packer at a florist's packing hampers during the Chinese New Year holidays. Although I was required to work overtime and was given minimal wages, I look back on those days with fondness now remembering my friendly co-workers and my pride in my first (albeit low) salary. I would highly encourage students to try out a variety of part-time jobs, so as to be able to try out different experiences, rather than opting for higher-paying, but boring jobs."	4
603	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"I think it is a good regulation that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Of course, there are pros and cons for smoking. As we know public transportation has not a direct way to fulfill our all destinations then it force us to stop in many stations first, moreover we should take the other one to reach our destination so it is already obvious why using a car is better. People who smoke will trigger chemical reaction in their brain which makes them feel good, happy, and comfortable, but they will have to get more cigarettes to achieve the same level of happiness. Thus, the first disadvantage is that people will gradually spend more money on smoking. Second, the most serious problem resulted from smoking is health damage. he jump from his bed to the street and walk to his way to see what he did every morning.when he walk after the stranger man  he notice that he stopped in every trash in the street to take a look and go to the next one, and guess what he saw Michael and run away also Michael was afraid. Smokers can't breathe as well as normal ones. They can't be good athletes. Health issues may influence their life qualities, too. Besides, smoking increase the risk of suffering from cancer. in modern day there is very little public transpotr are used,ganeral public prefer much faster and conveninece  ways of traveling  around.though the pulic transport are used in mager citys to avoied traffic conjustion,it is wlidly reconizge that public transport are eco friendly. That's the main reason I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. When someone smokes in a restaurant, it does not only influence others at that time but also people who come in the future. Because those furniture and walls may absorb the bad things come from the cigarettes, and then impact future customers. Thus, I think smoking ought to be prohibited at all the restaurants in the country."	4
604	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Just like almost everyone else, we see people smoking everyday in almost all places imaginable. Born and raised in the Philippines, a third-world developing nation, a country where the impoverished resort to smoking to suppress their hunger, I am no stranger to it. Whether it is outside our homes, near our schools, along the road, in the malls, and even outside hospitals, people smoke. Recently, however, smoking has begun to take flak. There have been clamors for banning smoking in public areas, specifically restaurants, as it is hazardous to public health – and therefore public interest. Blessed with the opportunity of education, we have learned from a very young age the risks and perils of smoking and equally important – second-hand smoke. I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens.So I do not agree with this afirmation, in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport. People patronize restaurants despite their higher prices to convenience stores, fast foods, and cafeterias not only because of the usually better tasting food options but also because of the ambiance – the environment. In addition, we will adjust company’s management direction in each department depend on market’s reaction and environment Like retailer, We have sold our products to KA system for few years, however, the products that we sold were usually popular consumer goods, it means cheat and have no enter obstacles for other supplier. This is why I believe that it is in the interest of the majority and therefore the public that smoking be generally banned in restaurants across the country, but with a few reservations. We cannot impede the smokers ' own rights. Therefore, I also believe that smoking should be allowed in select food institutions that cater primarily to smokers."	4

"@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the effects of computers are not good. Although the public transport is slow but it also do not take a long time of people to reach their destination because public transport nowadays are developed more fast and enough. People are on their computers so much that they dont enjoy nature anymore. In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life, but majority of ones is totally utopic. I think that computers are becoming an issue. he took the money the second day , he finished the registration and started in writing the story after long time spending in writing and did good job he went to give his story to the international student magazine office ,he found out there are a notice on the door say that the competition has canceled, he came back vey sad and told me what happened .Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake . For example, @NUM3 year old @CAPS1 used to go to the gym everyday before she got her own computer. Now every afternoon she finds herself in front of the computer monitor. If it wasn't for computers, I'm sure kids would be outside getting exersize. Computers are a serious issue. Have you ever found yourself in front of the computer screen, on a beautiful day outside? We were all excited, those from Lala Band minunate.Their voices have positive vibration through their musical and give you a good feeling.On the scene moves very well and know how to take pleasure to the public.I am feeling wonderful and my promise is that when going to have a special occasion to go to a concert supported by Lala Band, you will be with me.As like this in all my heart.I hope as those recounted by me in this mail and you feel a slight vibration from the concert. I think it would be best if you unplugged those computers for a day and just went outside and got some fresh air! If everybody keeps this habit of staying on your computers all day and not going outside, we might turn into a world of couch potatos! Im sure you dont want that. Lastly, I remember multiple times I said I would do something with my dad but I didnt because I was on the computer. Many people can agree with me. Instead of going out to interact with your friends many are just instant messaging them. The internet is amazing, but I think everyone forgot the joy of going out with friends and family. So get off those computers and call a friend. In conclusion, the effects of computers are bad. Many people are spending too much time on their computers and have less time exersising. They are on so much they dont enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with friends and family. I think after reading this you can see computers arent good."	4
606	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"Having a part-time job is an important and necessary element for college students. As long as one can organize his/her schedule well and use the time efficiently, a part-time job is a helpful experience and a good training for the future career. Several key benefits of a part-time job will be shed light on in the following. First, from a part-time job, a college student can get the real experiences related to his/her majoring subject, which helps one understand more and apply what he/she has learned. Environmental changes really need in the current situation.People contribuation is very important in this matter.The report explains how my town people taking care of my surroundings and to preserve this planet in a betterway. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately but he forget what he had to do after thinkig he rememebred that he had to visit his grandmother as she was ill and his mother told him that his grandmother wanted to see her doctor and wanted him to take her by his car as adoctor's clinic far from her house  peter decided to go and he drove his car to his grandmother's house in the next street after he arrived, he saw his grandmother was waiting for him on the front of the street he apologized to her and asked her to come to the car, ""never mind "" she told and ride the car beside him . Moreover, working outside of the school may gain the chance of meeting various people, which can further broaden one's horizon and enrich the knowledge. Besides, it is a good chance of practicing the way of dealing with people and business, e. g. cultivating the patience and toughness, or forming the habit of efficiency and punctuality, and this does well to one's survival in the society when going into the future career. The last but not least, part-time job is a help for reducing the financial burden or just a resource for earning more allowance. Comparing to stealing or cheating for money, a legal part-time job is a safe way for gaining money. All in all, a part-time job is helpful for a college student, and thus having ever experienced part-time jobs is important in a college life."	4

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Has a computer helped you ever answerd hard question or type up an essay for school for work? I know a computer has helped me far years so why would I teminate it or want it gone. Heres the controversy, many experts believe computers don't benefit society but people, such as myself, believe the exact oppositte. Their are many benefits to oconing a computer such as they're always a source of information, allow you to talk online with others, and they can help people with their school and job loans. No matter what the problem, don't you believe a computer is always a source of information that could help? Obesity and other thins about help, is a topic very important because the people is dying for this problem.For example, the form to prepare the food, is gonna be dangerous because a lot food have artificial thing that is no good for us. This is because everyone, from the most to the least intelligent people, have their opinions, ideas, and hard facts in a computer on the web. I once watched a movie of a man who despised computers and new technology. Thus, for most of his life he wondered the world with no hint or clue as where to @CAPS4 in search of a rare artifact called the @CAPS1 diamon. He never found the diamond but his son who searched it on the internet found out the root geo from @CAPS1 meant underground in ancient @CAPS2 culture. due to a computer he found the diamond underground, beneath the ancient @CAPS2 temples. Therefore, I believe if people would embrace technology such as computers they would find many things that they never thought of. My favourit sport is football i love it so much when i was young i used to watch football and my favorite team is Barcelona i was play with my friends at the street and we was happy with that so much and after that we played at playground like really football i love Cristiano Ronaldo so much he is the best player at the world a few people telling me that messi is the best player but i feel angry when i hear that because that is not true so i looking forward to meet my best player one day its like a dream to me . Many people use computers to stay in touch when they have no available phones, with a computer you could chat with your friend down the street or your family member on vacation in another country. But we don't have forgotten the cotamination by cars, We can use more the bicycle or public transportetion. for example, the only way many of our soldiers fighting wars stay in touch with their loved ones back home is by talking to them online with a computer. One thing I know is no matter how old to probably about @NUM1, if you have a job or go to school you have used a computer to help you with @CAPS4. Whether it was getting an answer to a homework question or researching a person for a project, we all use computers. Computers even have the ability to help you make brochures or pamphlets. This can greatly help you advertise if that is something you do at work. Also, many people don't have the neatest handwriting so they type their essay or letter to their boss, you can even choose what type of handwriting it types. No matter the case, with work a computer always helps. Yes, I do believe computers benefit the society. More environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of themthere is to that we have a center of care and, other more institutions, we also make environmental protection centers were people can visit and learn about this to sum up our village is very concentrated on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us Still take my suggestions seriously and continue to use your computer. Remember, it is always a source of info., you can chat online, and it helps with work."	4
608	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"A lot of students hold part-time jobs, even when they are not on their school holidays. Sure, part-time jobs give us extra money to spend because as youths, we seem to always want more things than we can afford. We do not want to burden our parents further by giving us more money, so we get jobs. However, some students get too obsessed with the idea of making money that they sometimes forget that their top priority as a student should be to concentrate on their academics. They take up more shifts, sacrificing valuable and limited time that they should ideally be using for their schoolwork or to study. If the need to make money is so strong because they need to buy so many things, then perhaps it is time to let go of a materialistic lifestyle and learn to be happy with what they already have instead. Part-time jobs teach us responsibility, but it should not be the case that it affects our performance in school. most of girl doesnt like this,i think that it takes us energy,we need to do exercise,reasonable diet...and so on. By then, we will regret that we did not spend the time we had busying ourselves with school instead."	4

"Hour after hour of gaming online and posting blogs on social networking sights is all one sees. Unaware at there surroundings, many people zone to their computer screens and only break @CAPS4 absolutely necessary. That is not what the world should become but that is what is society is creating. If the public transport will be by higher quality, faster and fewer rates, majority of citizens will be prefer: is more calm to relax and read a newpaper or a magazine during the way in a collective transport than an indiivdual one; moreover, the time spend up to go and came back will be reduced, because it promotes less car in the railway. Because of all the time spent on the computer, people's bodies are taking the negative effects. There is also less and less face-to-face interactions with family and friends. Another huge issue is cyber bulling. These are all problems that should be addressed. With all the time spend on a computer in a stuffy, dark room, how will our bodies be maintained properly? in my personal obinionits better to lern froma teacher not only dat you lern to pronounce the words correctly you also lern from a personwhat is in my opinion way better i thin k we spend enougth time on smart phones so i dont think its the best if we use them to lern as well. It is like trying to make bread without flour, without that necessity the bread will not rise its full potential. It is the same with the health and functions at our bodies. Exercise must be took part in to burn fat and calories, but it is also needed to build and maintain muscles. In fact, muscles start it is recommended to get in at least one hour of exercise of outside play a days. Not many succeed with this goal, which brings up another negative effect to the body. First of all, although travelling by car  become more convenient,   the growing population which cause personal vehicle is hard to manage.The traffic jam  becomes more and more serious as far. To get the recommended dose of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 a day you only need to absorb @NUM1 minutes of sunlight a day. It doesn't seem like a lot but @PERCENT1 of our population is not outside to recieve it. Instead, they are inside on their computers. Let me explain my reasons, when you drive your car you can take it from your garage or in the main door of your house and it gets you whatever you want, but on the other hand if you take public transport it will be much more uncomfortable because you must catch the bus in the bus stop... where is your nearest bus stop? But, what if one day you decided you were going to skip your lunch break with friends and instead spend time posting a daily blog. This is social time lost. If this habit continues you might soon see yourself drifting away from your friends because you don't make the time to spend lunch break with them. Even @CAPS4 a child interactions @CAPS4 chatting with friends on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6, anything could be said. Children wont learn at a young age how to think on there fact language. This will effect their later years @CAPS4 interviewing for things such as colleges or even jobs. Social skills are the difference between success and failure. Spending life on a computer is equivalent to being a caterpillar in their while at least attempting to be an extreme will turn you @CAPS7 and @CAPS7 are all created with the ominous cyberbulling. One simple way to prevent this is spending less time in the computer. The effects of cyber bulling can be brutal. A recent study showed that @PERCENT2 of kids would rather be bullied in face then over the internet. in modern day there is very little public transpotr are used,ganeral public prefer much faster and conveninece  ways of traveling  around.though the pulic transport are used in mager citys to avoied traffic conjustion,it is wlidly reconizge that public transport are eco friendly. Such cyberbulling has even led to suicides. In fact, a girl in committed suicide due to cyber bulling just @NUM2 weeks ago. Another ones which were bad sheets and bad bank notes from damaged apparently,would be destroyed securely.This was the whole working process of the bank notes and it was consist of 7 steps. A lack of exercise and proper body maintenance results. Reduced social interacting and skills also result. And maybe most importantly cyberbulling which takes lives occurs. In our earth, Hunderds of millions prople living in here.Except us, There are also a large number of wildlife."	4

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1; Technology seems to have a positive effect on people. But could it be a bad thing. The computer is one of the top uses by @CAPS2, but I think we spend a little to much time on it. My reasons are, kids and adults spend to much time on it, cant interact with friends or family and you cant enjoy nature. In England where I live, in Bedford, we use a lot the train to go in the most important town of UK, but the train are very expensive, me and my family stay careful if we go off pick because the price are to high. But when are you going to get your exercis of your on it for @NUM1 hours? But she is boyfriend live upstate and hasn’t got a airport he’s of city because of that she was need choose by train. As for food, you sit and eat junk food. You cant get a healthy meal if you eat chips & candy for hours. Negaticvs about the online lerning are dat your not listening to much from ea real person and more from a Computer, if you dont have any listening things in the app you dont lern how to pronounce the words. Its a great way to get fit, rather than typing and clicking away at your @CAPS3. Another way of getting fit, (than to sit) is going out for a run. Kids need about @NUM2 mins of cardio, so why not run your legs than your newest download? You work out your arms & your legs! My next reason why spending time on the computer too much is bad is because you wont have time for your friends or family. Are kids just going to sit at the computer all day while your family is having fun? Also, when you have chores to do, what will happen to them? The dishies will be dirty and your room will be a mess. Most of all wont you miss your friends? At this age kids/teens should be partying with friends and not gossiping online. Other reason for my opinión is that almost all the people preffer use the visual sense and ear to other person more than write and listen for understand new things. Lastly, my final reason is the most simplest; enjoy nature explore the outside instead of living on the inside. Its good to go out once in a while and get a breathe of fresh air. my father  my father name is Zaheer arat.he is very loving and caring.they gives us all the facilities one should have and dream of these things.he provides all the facilities to us of internet and books so that we can learn better and can be good students and get good marks in the examination.he always encouraged us and said don't afraid of anything because you are braver than anything else.my brothers and me proud of my father.he is very hard working and brave.he has the smiley face.he always tries to laugh other people with their jokes.he always listens to us what we want.he never ever ignore us. Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real. Then take a nice walk or stroll in the park. Your getting exercise & exploring nature too. While your at it, plant some flowers in your garden. This shows instead of buying games online, your buying seeds to help the environment. In conclusion, spending time on the computer is not bad, just dont spend hours-upon-hours on it. Kids will be kids, as well, adults will be adults. So take the considerations in hand. So try to get exercise, hang out with your friends & family, and enjoy nature!"	4
611	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"In these days, most universities in Korea are executing 100% online classes, non-face-to-face lectures. Using real-time lecture by ZOOM session and non-real-time lecture by KLMS is included in online courses. Actually, this type of lectures is very useful and necessary for universities. They should be executed for several reasons, and let me show two of them. after that the celebration was began and a lot of their friends have attended each one presented a gift for Sara , she was very delighted and suddenly the doorbell been rang  she was her old friend Tia . Students are able to take lectures at any time or anywhere you want Instructors can cut or edit the unnecessary parts of the lectures. Moreover, the students adjust the fast of lecture, and they use pausing to make their notes. Especially, this feature is very effective for Mathematics and Science lectures that the connects of formula are very important. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately but he forget what he had to do after thinkig he rememebred that he had to visit his grandmother as she was ill and his mother told him that his grandmother wanted to see her doctor and wanted him to take her by his car as adoctor's clinic far from her house  peter decided to go and he drove his car to his grandmother's house in the next street after he arrived, he saw his grandmother was waiting for him on the front of the street he apologized to her and asked her to come to the car, ""never mind "" she told and ride the car beside him . According to my friend, Minhan Gang, “The lecture is very helpful for me, because I can find many unknown words in lectures.”
Second, online classes are fundamental methods to prevent virus. The fundamental reason why we are doing 100% non-face-to-face classes is on the COVID-19 situation. If we participate offline classes, it is necessary for the pandemic situation to consist. Although the benefits of offline classes are very high, the effect of online classes for preventing the corona virus today overwhelms these benefits. Moreover, if we participate the offline classes, we have to use a hand cleaner, wear a mask, and participate several activities for preventing. These will be harmful for study. For these reasons, online classes are necessary for these days. Using online courses removes limitation for time-space, and they are a fundamental way to prevent COVID-19. in a car accident , when she her what happened with her brother she was so nervous then the miracle happened she found a big suitcase in the train she decided to open the bag because no one was in the train so she opened the bag she surprised when she saw  a lot of money inside the bag  .

Some students just need to get over grade than the grade that university said to, but  for some other student, this exam is totally their life. From this, there are some students who didn't get satisfied grade, and take exam again and again. This can be a great stress for many students. Nowadays, public transport is used for many people in the cities, we can find different types of them, such as bus tube and train, but is there a future for it or not?, I am going to respond this question giving disadvantanges and advantages and  finally I give my personal opinion. So, if I can change one thing from Korea, I want to downgrade the important of this exam, or loosen the ratio of course that choosing student just by this exam in university. For first reason, it can loosen stress of the students from one cause, and it can leads to two good effects. If the importance of this exam is downgraded, students can study in less forced environment. Now, teachers and parents around the students force their student strongly to study to get a good grade on this exam, but if it is not that important, they don't need to force their students. My favourite sport is playing tennis.I play it three times a week (on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays) in the club of tui.I had been playing tennis from 2 years ago with two of my best friends.I enjoy playing tennis because it is a sport that requires skills, concentration and speed.I am not very good at all but I like to play it with my friends and do matches on Saturdays . One of the things that make student hard to study is a stress. Students always have a stress of exam, and it always makes student hard to study. But, without stress, students can study what they want to, and it can improve the efficiency of study. Next, students can live at least happier life. Because of the huge stress from the exam, some students have a bad mind of their life and this world, and can suddenly lose the control and do some bad things. But, if we can make a less-stressful environment, some of this can be reduced. Next, downgrading the importance of exam can distribute chance equally to students from one cause, and it has some effects on student. From downgrading the importance of exam, university can not just see the score of the exam, but can see the students theirselves. University can see all students talent, and then can choose from the students. i dont think the public transport does not have future, there are a lot of people who can not buy a car and has to use the communite transport. Equal chance of going to university can lead students to do what they want to do. Students can make their effort to find their talent, not just studying hard. It can trully lead a talent from the students. In conclusion, I want to change Korea's final exam of going to university, by downgrading it's importance and loosening the ratio of course at university. This has two advantages: loosen students' stress, and distribute chance equally to students. Students can study more efficiently what they want to do, and can make at least happier life than these days. One night,as usual,I slept.In a flash,I rolled down from a mountain and I didn't know where I was.It just a very long tunnel where was dark and strange,After,I felt my body ache.I began to yell that hoped someone could  save me to leave from here."	4

"I choose the wheel because is the most useful invention ever because thanks to it the human works make easier by example a way to move heavy objects, compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today the wheel was invented at a relatively late point of human history, he oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia. But, to pick one of them, it is ""Academic English courses"". I think current courses for Academic English is not so effective. English ability that each students need is different in details. For example, students that hope to go academic course for research need ability for reading and writing, rather than listening and speaking. Because they have to interpret papers written English. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately.He had to buy a present for his girlfriend´s birthday but it was Sunday and all stores were closed so he had to found a solution.A few hours,he was walking by a garden,and suddenly,he saw the most beautiful flowers that he has ever seen,so he picked them up.However,flowers weren´t enough so he decided to think in anything else.Several hours later,he found an open sweet shop and he bought some bonbons for her.Finally,he had found the present and before the end of the day he ran quickly to his girlfriend's house.If you don't want to pass this situation,you must always do things with time. Because they have to speak with other people in same business, and present using English for many people. Students need different ability for English in details, as I mentioned above. So I want to change current English course in KAIST. For details, I want to make selective system for English courses. The ""selective system"" means the system that students can choose the English class that they need. For example, students who trying to strengthen writing ability can take the English class about writing skills. I think it can reduce stress from English for students. First, students don't have to study the parts of English that they don't need to strengthen. For example, ""students in intermediate level of English listening and don't need to improve it"" have no more duty for taking ""Academic listening"" class in this system. It can reduce stress of students. But today, Things are getting change and technology marked a significant role in our life, Automobile segment increased its vertical and having a car becomes a need from luxory. I think it will make the participation of students in class. And, students can improve the ability that they need, or they lake of. In conclusion, it will be good"	4

People how can go on to their computers to communicate with peers, get information on any topic for a school paper, or just because the internet to watch videos and stories. Magazine and newspaper articles, books and even movies and shows sre available on today's computer! This advancement in technology has made the @NUM1 century the most modern era this world has ever seen, and is beneficial to society. The ""computer age"" has given people in today's society the incredible opportunity to broaden their imaginations through technology. You can, in less than one minute go on the internet type in to @ORGANIZATION1 whatever movie or book you want and start watching instantly. People have always said that books can take you anywhere you want. Well, the computers can do the same thing, expect with greater efficiency and with more places to choosen from. You can, instead of buying a book, go online and read of the faraway city of @LOCATION1, or of the eruption of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and you can do it with mind-blowing speed. MEASURES IN FAVOUR OF TAKING CARE THE ENVIRONMENT The council is carrying out a project in order to erradicate the rubbish in my town.This project is focused on separating the rubbish in each green points of the city and also they have to maintain their neighbourhood as clear as are possible. Howeer, any information needed to your knowledge on a topic can be found on the internet. And if you want to spent time with your family, you can even look your computer up to a tv and watch a free movie with the family! The computer age is here and it is exactly. What society needs. Picture this: you're doing a school project on the you know nothing about it. Would you rather drive minutes going and thirty minutes looking withb everything you need, or do you think it's more to spend five minutes looking for the website you need on the internet? Obviously, the later of the is much more reasonable. The computer makes getting research for school or work substantially easier. The television is one of the most important AV media in the world.You can use it for many purposes, according  to your needs .There are a lot of channels in many roles,for instance , education , movies, songs ,sports,news and so on .The television is not only for entertainment but also for education .The television can entertain you through it's entertained channels, and the television can educate you through it's educational channels. Being an eighth grade student, I dont know I would ever do woithout the internet. But, in this moment the people think different, is to start to help the world and  Contamination is big problem for us and the planet. The computer is the likes of all the hard working students and adults much, much easier. People's lives have not only been made easier in the field of research; computer make communicating with friends and familyeasier as well! When I was young , I enjoyed playing basketball.I thought that it's the best sport ever.It made me fit and strong.It taught me the meanings of teamwork and leadership.I Kept playing basketball 4 years continuously till I joined the secondary school.My advice to anyone starting basketball is to never giving up and always keep playing till the last minute. With some computers, you can even see and talk to any person you wish. First, Basketball is team sport when it means i need to understand expression of  members  of team and keep contact them  for example  my roll is cutter but i need to do assister, blocker and guarding when i play. Computers have enhanced communication chill likes so graetly that it's foolish to say their not beneficial to society. How can a machine with so many abilities be for see the computer as a brooden research for school and we want! Bottom line the computer age is here and its amazing."	4

In our modern day society computers are crucial tools that help organize files, do reasearch, and pleasurable online networking. Computers teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and allow people to socialize online. Without computers wouldn't life be difficult?

First of all,we should thinking out a design and dicide the background colour and artwork,or even security issues.And then for the preparation of metal plates ,the skilled and machinists is considerate.Nect,printing,sheets of bank notes printed (50 bank notes per sheet)colour on both sides,and specWell,the most important step is inspection,we should printed sheets manually inspected. hello, i want the job for the summer camp i'm looking for children between 8-12 years old i will help to organise sports and evening activities and if you want i could work in the kitchen if i have the job write soon                                                                   victoria In our bustling university life, full of struggles and challenges, we would not want any more complicated situation at least in our dorm room. Therefore, we should be comfortable with our roommate and thus we need the opportunity to choose. Moreover, if we share a room with our friends, we may receive the comfort and support we need during our hardships. Secondly, choosing our roommate with purpose can lead to a fun life on campus. Everyone has their own preference and hobbies. If we select our roommates based on our similar tastes in music, favorite food, or hobby, we would have a higher chance to match with them. We will have more topics to have a conversation about and more activities to do together. Moreover, for some people, the roommate's age may affect whether they can be comfortable throughout the stay. In such cases, the university assigning a roommate limits the option. Some people say that a tripp by car is more convenient that by the public transportation, but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations.It is true that travel to a nearby place from your city, it  is more comfortable getting there by car, and the ease of have your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time paying  cabs. They may think that meeting new people will help students improve their social skills. However, we will have enough chances to improve our social skills during classes since professors focus on communication and teamwork nowadays. In summary, students should have the chance to choose their roommates because they will be more comfortable with them. Although having an unfamiliar roommate may sound fun, it has risks to be otherwise. Therefore, I hope you choose. your roommate wisely for your own better life on campus."	4

"Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 a world filled with gargantuan people seated at a moniter, their eyes staring at it blankly. Outside the city streets are deserted, save for the squirils running along fence posts. This is what will happen if people spend to much time on the computers. People will spend less time exercising, less time outdoors enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. This is why computers have a drastic negative affect on people. This major involves all, always we have to consider the all possibilities to resolve  homework , you have to know the most possible information for can resolve it. In a recent poll done by @ORGANIZATION3 magazine, it stated that @PERCENT1 of people between the ages of @NUM1 and @NUM2 prefer to be online rather than outside exercising. That article also states that since @DATE3, child obesity has increased by @PERCENT2! @PERSON2 of @ORGANIZATION1 at @ORGANIZATION4 states that “ the reason child obesity has increased so much is because children spend so much time in front of the computer and less time outdoors. Do you want this rate to increase in the next ten years? Secondly, spending so much time inside decreases the time you spend outside enjoying nature. Bird watches monthly has had a decrease in subscriptions the @DATE1 because people are not interested in nature anymore. In a study done by @PERSON1 and his collegues at @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 spend almost @PERCENT3 more time indoors infront of electronic devices, most frequently computers, then they do out doors. @PERSON3 says, “@CAPS4 to the new advancements in technology, people are to spend more time indoors than outdoors and that percentage will most likely increase as the decade proceeds”. Finally, spending so much time in front of the computer leaves you less time to interact with family and friends. In @DATE4 more than @PERCENT4 of family ate dinner together now, only @PERCENT5 eat together usually because they are in separate rooms in front of a moniter. This also leads to higher crime rate, believe it or not. Because young children and adolescents don’t have the person to support and guide them because they don’t spend time together @CAPS4 to the frequent use of computers, there is a @PERCENT6 chance that child will commit a crime compared to the @PERCENT7 chance a child would in @DATE5. Do you want that for our youth? I believe that the people in a future they will begin to travelling shared car more time and they use less the public transport as the train, the bus, underground, etc. As the joggers proceed, they come to a pavilion and see a big family celebrating the @DATE2 of a family member. This happy thought won’t become a reality if people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising ,enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. So, local newspaper I encourage you, to encourage others, to get outside and spend less time infront of the computer. You have the power to make a difference in your real lives. But the question is, will you?"	4.5

"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people. With a computer you could do so many things! They provide plenty of information, communication, and even entertainment. The only reason some find it to be unhealthy or negative is because some people abuse their ""computer-time"". Ever used the popular website ww.google.com? Sites like this, and many more, are great when you need information. Your practically just type in a word and automatically have hundreds or thousands of links, containing information on that word, to choose from! football is a fameous sport you can whatch it on tv or yo can see it on direct.there ara a lot of  level categories, the most fameous categorie is the first. Computers have dictionaries, references, translators, encyclopedias, or even history pages that hold massive informatiion. So go ahead and expand your knowledge! If you log onto one of the most famous and well-used social networking websites, such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, you will find a new way to communicate with friends and family. I went to a  awesome concert of points of view and I know that I look forward to telling you how it was.But let me tell you it was a concert that the  performed Lala Band and I have taken and I especially, I was the cameraman.It was an excellent night.The concert was evening began at 20:00 and came a lot of persoane. Again, many people abuse those websites, putting up harmful words, inappropriate things, but that problem can be easily solved if you ""report' them to the website manager or to an adult. You just have to know how to be safe online, if not, the computer can be a very negative object for you. When i was arrived at home, i was started to read the news paper, so i found from there The International Student Magazine have to organize a short story competition, and I decide to call Michael to tell him about this contest. There is a wide variety of entertainment on your computer. From video-sharing websites like www.youtube.com. to gaming websites like www.onemorelevel.com. These sites provide games and many videos, or even learning aids. There are sites where you can purchase music ang movies, or even clothes and furniature. Many stores have online websites wher you can purchase items and have them shipped to your front door. How could that possibly be regroup? Also, there are video games that are specially created for the computer, that you can buy, and have installed for isntant entetainment. I mean, who doesn't like to play games or shop, without having to go through the trouble of finding time to go out and do it? I know my aunts do. So you see, computers aren't negative, unless you abuse your ""computer-time"" and waste countless hours for no reason. You need to have a limit. Without it, it's just plain weird spending all day on a computer. So have fun! Learn, communicate, entertain youself."	4.5
619	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Nowadays, some people take smoking as a method release the stress, but I strongly oppose smoking. There are several reasons presented as follows. First of all, it is in terms of health that smoking is very bad to body at all. Online Lerning Positiv things about the online lernign are dat you are more mobile with your smartphone and you dont have to carry so much paper with you, also your on your own and in your own lerning speed what makes it more spesific on the user it selfs. According to studies that smoking has higher percent to suffer from lung cancer, laryngo-carcinoma, and oral cavity cancer and so on. What is more, it is not only smokers themselves but also others who don't smoke that would be harmed by cigarettes. That is, experts believe that secondhand smoke do much more damage to people. Besides, they say that a secondhand smoker is smoking six cigarettes while a smoker is smoking only one cigarette. Therefore, stopping smoking is not simply for smokers themselves but also others nearby them. Last but not the least; it is smoking itself that would build a negative appearance of smoker. Most people don't like the smell of cigarettes. Therefore, many people believe that the action of smoking would make them obscene and disliked by others. In a result, we would try our best to prevent people from smoking."	4.5
620	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Libraries are a source of information. They provide us with valuable research, entertainment, and cold hard facts. Therefore, I do not believe that libraries should have to censor the books that are supplied for the citizens to check out. Everyone is faced with choices in life. Some are more difficult than others and will have a greater impact on your life. We decide if we want to wear the black shirt or the grey shirt, the blue shorts or the brown shorts. Everyday we have choices. We also have choices at a library. If we see a book with a title that sounds like @CAPS2 might be offensive, then we should just walk past @CAPS2. Most libraries are organized and the book sections are clearly stated. Common sense would tell us that this section might contain offensive material. We have the choice on whether or not we check out a book that might offend us or not. If @CAPS2 does offend us, then @CAPS2's our own fault. The second reason libraries should not censor what books they provide goes right along with the choices we make in life. No one forces us to check out this book or that book. @CAPS2's a choice. The sport is very importatnt of our body it has many benefits to emprove our selves and give us self confedant so we should practice any sport we love because it can change our mind to the better. @CAPS2 just doesn't happen like that. No one forces us to @CAPS1 something we don't want to. @CAPS2's all up to you and how you feel about the book. Different subjects offend different people. I'm not offended by a curse word here or there, however; I am offended by sex related instances that often occur in movies or books. I make my own choice to not watch or @CAPS1 those kinds of materials. Since everyone is different, the sex related instances might not offend another group of people and they might see @CAPS2 as perfectly fine to watch or @CAPS1. Different subjects offend different people and taking away a book or movie because @CAPS2 offends one person should not happen. If libraries were to start censoring what materials they put on the shelf, I believe many people would be upset. Who would decide what is offensive and not offensive? @CAPS2 would upset too many customers and the use of libraries would probably dwindle. When you are in charge of censoring what goes on the shelf many problems come into play. Do you count different religions offensive because they blaspheme another religion's god? Do you count a certain work of fiction offensive because @CAPS2 contains one curse word in the whole book? There is no way to properly censor all your books without upsetting customers. I'm not saying that libraries should be allowed to show every magazine known to man. Ferrari making one of the fastes cars on the word, but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac, how they were in the past.If sameone like cars then should go to Formula 1 race to hear the bolid engine sound, I think that is the best voice which I have ever heard in my life.Formula 1 it is also  dangerous sport, the driver are exposed to the risk of  accident at high speed. There are too many people in this world to try and censor the materials libraries display. Libraries should not censor the materials they display"	4.5
621	Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Many students are studying hard for success and getting nice jobs. Sometimes, we hate the studying because it is so boring and difficult. According to statistics from Nelson, 88% of Korean high school students have experienced the feeling of stop studying during exam period. Accordingly, we should consider most effective way to study and concentrate for learning. Although some argue that they prefer to study alone, I believe that studying with a group is the better choice. First of all, many have argued that the surrounding study environment of students should be quite for concentrating. They believe that just quite condition is the best for students. However, according to research, some noise is helpful to concentrating on something(Choi). For example, many students find the cafe because they can feel more comfortable in the condition of enough noise. If you study with your friends, you can talk with them in the rest time, so it may encourage you for keep studying. Next, some argue that students will not study because they just chat with each other. However, there are several benefit of group studying that overcome the risk of chatting each other. The group member may be able to help you to solve the assignment. For example, in the case of KAIST, the assignment problems are usually difficult, and many students may not solve them alone. If you study with your department friends, they can share the solutions or ideas, and they will solve the problems together. Also, according to research, students who study with a group make more advanced and creative solution for social problem(Bai). Therefore, we can expect the great effect of group study. And to day is necessary because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversation with their you need to now more than your foreign language, because in the rest of the world and particularly in Europe people now more than two language and that great. If you meet your friends and study together, you can also learn the social relationship. You will discuss, share the idea, and make decision with agreement of all group member. Sources:

622	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"A Small Number of Students
Recently, the debate on the form of giving college education is rising. Some claim that every student should have the opportunity, on the other side, others declare that it should focus on the outstanding students. Despite the claims that a college or university education should be available to all students, it should be available only to good students. First of all, it is economically efficient to manage a small number of students. Fdi can play important role in it.It give competition to national companies .By virtue of which they  work properly mannerly and give better option to policy holders.people can always buy nominal premium we should aware them about the types of insurance as well as benefits of the insurancce. Given that the expenditure on laptops and food is very high, it is natural that additional college financial support for students is made so that students can focus solely on learning. By considering the limited financing of school is distributed samely among the students, supporting a small number of students can provide sufficient or more support. In addition to economic efficiency, focusing on small numbers can cultivate elite leaders. The momentous person in the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution is a great leader, who leads the society. Usually, one of the factors related to the quality of learning is the number of students per professor. For example, in the case of general liberal arts lectures, as many as 300 students are taught by one professor; thus, the quality is naturally lower than that of one professor teaching to five students. Hence, teaching a small number of students, these situations will overlap, and in the end, individual students will have outstanding competencies. Some argue that everyone has freedom of education, so they insist college or university education should be available to all students. It may be true that if no other form of education was considered. University is a place to create good talent, but it is not the only place to gain expert knowledge. Anyone can listen to public lectures such as K-mook, for example, and anyone with the will can obtain specialized knowledge of the university through educational services. It gives the students the freedom to choose his major and the teachers.In addition, it has a lot of facilities that serve students like kindergarten that takes care of children these employees, university housing, hospital the student of medicine can be application in it and it serves the people too, and a big library has many books in various languages. This approach is more economically efficient than the way of educating everyone, and it can create strong talent. In addition to the university, there is also a window for the general public to listen to education, which prevents worry about when this method is implemented. Therefore, all university facilities will have to seriously consider the policy of raising a small number of elite students."	4.5
623	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Nowadays, there still exist many uncivilized behaviors in the public such as smoking, spitting, littering. Especially, I believe that smoking recklessly in the public both does harm to the health of people and to the environment. So, I support the initiative that smoking should be completely banned in the public. The following reasons can be figured out to support the argument. Undoubtedly, banning of public smoking is not only beneficial to others but also to the smoker's health. If smoking is banned, smokers may smoke less, there are less second hand smoking released into the air, so people have less chance to be exposed to the polluted air. Furthermore, no smoking environment will bring us fresh air and good mood. One day a man and his wife were trying to found a place shallow and without pollution for cultivate, they were poor; they don’t have the necessary sources, but the husband work so hard because his wife had an accident it occurred one day that his wife was working in a campaign of conservation of animal in endangered, she went to a place in search of animals, she heard a sound in a dark place of the jungle so she went to investigated what was that, a creature that have never seen attack she, her partner only heard a shout and they found Lucy the wife of the man in the floor, they ask she if she is ok but he don’t answered so her partner toke it to the doctor, there the doctor said that she was ok but he will never hear again or only if she paid 1 000 dollar for a operation. In addition, it is a reminder that we should improve our awareness of caring others. Since it is not only beneficial to the smokers themselves but also to the society, why not take it?All mentioned above tell us the advantages of the banning.

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"The topic that is on many minds in our country is, ""Are computers beneficial, or harmful to our students?"" @CAPS1 have evolved from dosktop computers, and before that, type writers, but have they gone too far? Currently we have got more than six different types of banks in our streets but as far as I know it is not sufficient to meet the needs of the environment because nowadays we do produce a lot of different materials, all of them overproduced and we do only learn this education in our home in our childhood, accordingly I am one of the few worried teenagers in the world about it so I really do help the environments as far as I can. Being able to have faster research, easier communicating and computers in wartime are great capabilitys of the modern computer. Also, due to advancement in technology, computers are very helpful because they help @LOCATION4 with our daily lifes. Many doubts about the computer exist, but the computer can surpass all of them. In a time crunch situation like college or high school, speed is everything. Computers allow students to research faster, and with more accuracy by being able to search for key words. Before, students would have to do the painstaking process of searching in books. More times than not, they wouldn't find what they were looking for, but with the modern age, students can get the information they need fast. subsequently,this step is most important.bank note should be inspected.bank notes separated into good and bad if get good quality sheets,the next stage is packaging and distribution.at this stage sheets should be cut into separate bank notes,packed,and dispatched. If speed is what you need, then you will look for a computer. Besides speed, computers also give you another great thing, communication. With emails, @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and blogs, knowing what your friends are doing later is just a click away! This is much easier than calling the person. Also having this access to friends can help when one moves away. If you miss a long lost friend or cousin, just search their name, and you can talk to them! Having friends so close by you can really make every life great. Out in @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION1, solgiers rely on computers for valueable information; such as radar, or robots. Having computers do the ""dirty work"" can help in times of war, and can save valuable lives. Not having these computers would mean certain death for some people in the @LOCATION4 armed forces. Computers some times take the place of humans in things such as @ORGANIZATION1's, or unmaned airieal vehical and some many lifes too. Weather it be facebook or bombings, computers help in a vital way. It was @DATE1 and @PERSON1's communist regime was ruling new @LOCATION2. One man stood in front of a tank, resisting to move, showing courage and wanting a democracy. Pass some years  of the university and he know a girl called Kate and he get loved on here and she get loved in him. How was it broadcasted to the world? Using the computer, and internet. Today many people are able to learn about that due to computers. In many ways computers help @LOCATION4 with our daily lives and for most of @LOCATION4, without them, we would be lost."	4.5
625	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"   Nowadays, entering in an university is not as hard as before. I am now studying in the university called Korea Advanced Institute Science Technology (KAIST), which is one of the most famous universities in Korea. Even though I like my university and it considered as a good university in Korea, I want to change one important thing of it, which is the location. Followings are my specific reasons about why I want to change the location of my university. First of all, Daejeon does not have many entertainments to enjoy the college life. As far as we know, Daejeon is a big city, but it is really peaceful. To be compared with Seoul, which is the capital of Korea, Daejoen does not have some places that can play like ""lotte world"" in Seoul. KAIST students always have much stress and it is important to rest and get out of stress sometimes. However, KAIST students only can go to eat delicious dinner or go shopping while Seoul National University students are going to lotte world and play extremely. In my opinion, studying hard in the university is important, but enjoying college life is also as important as academy. Therefore, if I could change one important thing in my university, it would be the location of the university. Furthermore, Daejeon does not have many opportunities to internships. Since Daejeon is a bit far from Seoul, there are not big companies in Daejeon. During the university, it is quite important to go to internships and get some social experiences. To begin with,the format of the bank notes needs to be designed,factors of considerations including the background colour,the artwork and the security issues.Sencondly,equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps.Thirdly,print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink,where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes. Most of students want to do internships in big company and big companies are always located around Seoul. Moreover, if we do internships in Seoul, we should find a place to live during the internship, since it is too far from our dormitory. To sum up, my university is good for academy, but since it is far from Seoul, it is uncomfortable for enjoying college life and doing internships. Therefore, if my university were located in Seoul or around Seoul, it would be much better."	4.5

     Many KAIST students live at the westside dormitories such as Huimang-Hall and Dasom-Hall. There are two ways to go Westside dormitory. One is from North through the Endless-load, and the other one is from South through KISTI. Some students who live in Westside dormitories, especially Huimang-Hall, ask to make a tunnel which through Eoun-Mountain. the citizens in the town must participate in this , the citizen will take the responsibility for specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish into correct place and clean tree and plant more of it . First of all, the time to go to the most KAIST campus building from the Westside decrease. Many students who live in the Westside dormytories walk around the mountain to go to the campus buildings that are rocated at the Northside and Eastside of KASIT. However, if there is the tunnel through the mountain, the walk time is surprisingly decrease. For example, when a student walk from W8 to Huimang-Hall, it takes about more than 10 minutes, but if the tunnel is rocated to connect W8 to Huimang-Hall, it decrease to about less than 2 minutes. Second, the tunnel can be the landmark of the KAIST. There are no university that has own tunnel in its campus in Korea. If the tunnel is made, KAIST become the first university which has the own underground civil engineering structure. It raises the honor of the Civil and Environmental Engineering department and can be the chance to be famous. Finally, the usage of tunnel is various. The tunnel work not only as the walkway, but also as the place of convergence. SInce the tunnel do not need the viechel road, students can use the large place like busking place. In the Korea regulation, the width of tunnel is about 6m, and the two way walkroad is about 2m. The 2m from the edge can be used freely, and creative students in KAIST can use it creatively. To sum up, making the tunnel through the Eoun-Mountain decrease movetimes of students who live is the Westside dormitories, it can be the landmark of KAIST, and sudents can use is various."	4.5
627	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"Some people think that teenagers have part-time job is bad. Because they think part-time job is a cause of their low grade. And they even think that the teenagers who do the part-time job are a delinquent student. But I think they are prejudiced. They can learn about economic strength. Besides, part time job has some benefits for teenager. So, in my opinion, teenagers having a job when they are still students are a good way of learning about society. Here are some reasons that why I agree for the teenagers having their jobs. 1 First, teenagers can know the value of money is worth as they earn money themselves. Nevertheless the journalists stay all the time having a photo,all the time,when they eaten, drinking, happy, sad,how is your love life and with whoever stay, if stay with something important our what buy. But they do anything in order to have money. hello, i want the job for the summer camp i'm looking for children between 8-12 years old i will help to organise sports and evening activities and if you want i could work in the kitchen if i have the job write soon                                                                   victoria If they have part-time jobs, they can know about it. So, part-time jobs can help the teenagers to take care of their money. Second, they can learn about many people and economic. For example, teens working in some place like'Starbucks', they can see a lot of kinds of people. Some people are younger than them, but many other people are older than them. They can learn saying, ideas, and attitudes. By doing this, they can be established right values. There are many good places where teenagers can work: convenience stores, fast food restaurants, parking assistants, etc. Teenagers can learn worthwhile things through their part-time jobs in a way they cannot through textbooks, doing assignments. Therefore, I agree with teenagers' job."	4.5
628	University: Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Various Major than One Subject

     World-leading celebrities do not stay in just one field. In addition to one's main major, a wide range of knowledge in various fields is needed. In order to grow into a successful talent, various educational curricula are emerging, but universities still remain in the past even though they are the last gateway just before talent heads to society. Now that complex developments in various fields take place, it is necessary to keep up with the trend of the times. In order for students to experience various career-related fields from college, universities should encourage students to take various courses for the following reasons. First, each student should be given the right choice for design. Reviews of subjects other than major requirements vary widely because each student has a different depth in dealing with major. For example, even with the same major, majors that are not related to their careers may feel unnecessary depending on the student. Rather, some majors can be efficiently approached in other subjects. It is necessary to lift restrictions on majors that allow them to make various choices depending on their circumstances. Next, it helps students get a job. Since various companies gradually prefer convergence talent, it is advantageous to get a job to show excellence in various subjects. In addition, since one's career path is constantly changing in life, increasing interest in various fields will help one develop one's career path. Universities also have different reputations depending on the employment rate of students. This will soon affect the quality of the class, so it will be able to start advantageously. Some argue that taking other subjects can lead to a decline in students' expertise. In fact, taking other related courses will be of greater help to your career than taking major courses for credit restrictions. Most subjects require knowledge in various fields as well as majors. In order to use this efficiently, experience in the subject is essential. In an era where various complex fields are in the spotlight, experience in various fields becomes a great competitive edge. television entertains as well as it will educate the people.These days are educating themselves by watching the television.Televison not only provide entertainment it will give lots of information about the happenings around the globe.Channels like national geographic and animal planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origination of species.Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people Unnecessary restrictions on required credits for majors should be lowered, and classes that can be linked to other subjects should be increased. Through this, students will be able to follow the right curriculum in relation to their own careers. The sport is very importatnt of our body it has many benefits to emprove our selves and give us self confedant so we should practice any sport we love because it can change our mind to the better. Talent is born by mixing various knowledge in free exploration and play."	4.5
629	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"All authors write for a purpose, whether it be to teach, entertain, or persuade an audience. With a great effort sate down on the grass, he feels tired, and has a little sensation of pain in his boson, site there with many sounds on air, he star recall...his face is changing is dark, he has now a clear image of all, when opened the door of the house his girlfriend is there dying on the floor, Michael remember all, the fight, the lays, the screams, the knife...the blood; but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. So, if every author wants to express something through their writing, then why should we not let them be heard. We all have the freedom of speech, right? So, why not the freedom of writing? Libraries should not remove a book, music, movie, or magazine from the shelf just because they found it offensive. Everyone will read a book that they don't like, its natural, but that doesn't mean that no one will like it. Authors write for an audience, but maybe you are not in that audience; so, it doesn't appeal to you and might even seem offensive. Not everyone believes in the same ideas. You could think about an issue one way and your neighbor think about it a totally different way. Like for instance, you're reading a book about a young girl that is going through many problems in her life. She told me not good at all, but my was good and she also added that you may got the chance and finally I got it.After three days later our result has been published and I got the chance but the girl didn't. Some of these situations you read about are so awful that you wouldn't want anyone else to read it. But, did you ever think that maybe there's another girl that is or has gone through some of these same situations. Maybe this girl comes to a library and finds this book; suddenly she finds guidence in it. She finds something she can depend on in her life that she's never had before. She feels like she has a friend in this book that can handle the situations with her. So, would you really want to take that book off of the shelf and not let that girl ever find her guidence? Situations happen like this all of the time. People find something special in what they read that other people might not find. When a librarian takes a book off of that shelf, an opportunity is forever gone. No one will ever be able to learn of what was to become of that writing and of those ideas. We all have a right to learn, to explore new ideas, and to expand our minds. No one should have the right to take that away"	4.5

"Dear @PERSON4, I strongly believe that use of computer is beneficial to the community. One reason I feel this way is that computers can improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. These computers provide access to games helpful in @ORGANIZATION2 training. In fact, @ORGANIZATION2, in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, just began using these games as part of their training this @DATE1. Instructors report that @ORGANIZATION2 skills in trainees and students are far better than in years past. Additionally, computer games can improve reflexes. Two years ago, a man named @PERSON3, @NUM1 years old, fell onto the train tracks just as a train was coming by. Through extra-ordinary reflexes he managed to leap out of the way, saving his life. When asked how he did @CAPS5, he said he had been playing computer games since he was @NUM2 years old. He seems different, she never imagined that Jason can be like that, she fantasy with someone, brave and strong, and she never foresees something like this, but she feel something for him, maybe she is in love with this guy . I believe that the people in a future they will begin to travelling shared car more time and they use less the public transport as the train, the bus, underground, etc. The researchers achieved this data by attaching electrolytes to the patient's brain both before and after using the computer. @CAPS5 is for these reasons that computers improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. last year I saw a movie called ''side by side'' , and talked a little of life in old history  , and coincidence I was having this matter in school, then it helped me a lot. They even allow you to communicate with your family who live far away, strengthening your relationships. I recently got back in touch with my cousin who moved to @LOCATION3. Letters were too expensive and took too long, but email and skype provide us with a great alternative. These computers also improve social skills. @PERSON1, resident here in town, says, ""I love using computers because I can talk to my friends whenever I want, and I feel like @CAPS5 really helps us communicate."" Who wouldn't love a machine that provides a service like that? These computers can even improve your mood. In a test done by @ORGANIZATION3 in @DATE3, @NUM3 people were put in seperate rooms with personal computers for @NUM4 hour. Afterwards, @PERCENT2 said they felt an improvement in their mood. Computers are great because they allow you to talk online. Finally, computers allow you to learn about other places. Virtual tours are becoming more and more common today. Infact, at @CAPS2.org, you can take virtual tours of over @NUM5 different countries, including @LOCATION5, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION6. You can also learn about other cultures and their traditions through online videos at youtube.com and articles at wikipedia.org, the free encyclopedia. You can even learn new recipes. Celebrity chef extraordinare @PERSON2 not only posts all her recipes online at mstewart.com, but she even finds some of them! In a recent interview by @CAPS3 magazine, when asked where she's found some of her best recipes, including her famous @CAPS4 chocolate cake, @PERSON2 admits she found most of them online, saying, ""@CAPS5's a powerful resource that more people should use. Al @CAPS6 currently owns the world's best cookbook!"" @CAPS5 is because of this that computers allow you to learn about other place. Thank you for your time, and I hope you take what I have said into consideration. @CAPS5 is for all of these reasons I strongly believe computers are beneficial to the community."	4.5
631	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"It is very important for college students to have a job while in college because it goes a long way to equip a student with enough job experience while still in college, and by the time the student graduates, he then stand a better chance of getting a job than other applicants with little experience. He had taken on a job while in college. It also goes along way by helping the student have a practical work of what he/she is being taught in school. It also gets us equipped with new knowledge of professional ethics and code of conduct at our working place having a part time job during your college life would also be an experience that may come in handy later in life. A part-time job can help you pay for living expenses, including housing, food, books, gas, and clothes. Since you will eventually have to pay off any school-related loans that you take out, it is best to take out as little as possible. Lastly, it is always good to have money. While money may not be the most important thing in life, it does buy things such as food, heat and a roof. Does why, is easy to believe that if things continue with this rhythm and transforming everything, in a closer future of 50 years everything is gonna be completely knew and different. All college students should attempt to get a job while in college and they should earn their own money to support themselves."	4.5

Travelling by car is convenient but there are dis advantage as well.As our population growing fast in a family both husband and wife working and children at university able to drive, so you are looking per house least 3 cars, so imagine how busy our roads will be.As now fuel price coming down that does not mean that it will stay like that for ever, price go up and down. Computers! Computers seem to be the talk of the year. Many people believe that computers are needed for everyday life, but I would have to disagree. In my opinion we do not need computers. The effects computers have on kids and adults are astonishing. Humans today are not spending as much time in nature and excirsising for a healthy body and a healthy planet. Also, as us kids are growing up, we have too many advantages because of computers. Thirdly, so much money is being used towards computers and not whats truely important! As you can see these three reasons alone should persuade anyone to believe that computers are harmful to all areas of life. First off, as we continue to use computers our natural environment is going to waste. The effects on nature and people are horrible. Polution is being spread all over the planet! People are becoming addicted to computers. I know it will surprise you when I tell you that the average person spends about ten hours on a computer a day! This is about half the day! This is a terrifying effect on people, because now these computers are brain washing us! Instead of going on the computer all day, we should be going outside to enjoy fresh air and the sun. Sometimes, some tv shows are so great that helps you in determinate class,for example, Animal Plante can help you in biology, The History can help in history, etc... In my opinion the television can be good as books, and can also be a form of learning as good as only reads books, because TV is something fun, so you can learn and have fun at the same time. Consiquently, banning computers would have a positive effect. Today, many are loosing their ability to write card forgetting about the simple things life has to offer would writing an essay with a pencil and paper be so bad? This @MONTH1 be old fashioned, but there are an enormous amount of great effects for using pen and paper. Maybe, the @ORGANIZATION2 states would become smarter and contain more knowledge. By writing everything out is proven to help remember important facts easier and for a longer amount of time, writing on paper is like writing it in you brain. Therefore, students, children and adults would benefit by having better handwriting. Since most information is typed on the computer people are forgetting how to write neatly, clearly, and resonsibly. As well, we have to promote that the people get jobs close their accommodation or get the accommodation close to the jobs, because we have too much pollution and we could reward the companies that hire staff close to the place of job, maybe in a circle of 4 kilometres, as well we could reward the people that turn their accommodation for live near to the job or for going  there by a bicycle. @PERSON1 told me, ""@CAPS1, students are completely absorbed in computers and have no life, energy, or reativeness in them anymore! Kids have too many advantages with computers and not taking the time. Last, but most definetley not least is my third reason as to computers are effecting humans negetively. Humans are sending huge amounts of money on getting the latest computer technology. Most of people pay chedes are being used for their computers. These fancey computers are very expensive, but also very useless. Suddenly we heard the sound of running footsteps.Then there was a cry and the footsteps stopped.Nervously,we walked back.Perhaps someone had been killed,or kidnapped in the street We were going to see what happened ,and we had something to see.There was one old granny who was beat up.We try to gave her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that.Than we were trying to find help ,but nobody was opening doors.On our luck I had a mobile phone ,but Michael was saying that we need to escape because we did not know are those bullies near the corner.My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I've done that. Instead, the money can be spent on schools, and especially the wars! Do you hear the humming of the computer the clicking of the buttons? Realize that these sounds are not what you should be spending! To wrap it up, computers effect people. There are many reasons to support this, but here are three. One is that people are not spending any time in nature! Another is that people of all ages are becoming brainwashed by this electronic and not spending the time to learn things in quality. Thirdly, people are using all there money on those computers! I know some people think computers are very usefull,but I know now, after you have read this article, you know how unuseful computers really are."	4.5

"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1, Computers have advanced our world so far into the future that practically everything is just a click away. Experts are awed that over the years, computers have helped billions of people get jobs done foster and smoother than ever before. Technology has helped doctors find new cures for patients, and diagnose their sicknesses in a more advanced way. Thousands of professions require the limitless knowledge of the internet, and computers continue to advance and redefine our way of living. Furthermore, kids of all ages benefit from modern computers. First,the bank notes are designed by consider,thinking from background colour,artwork,security issues.Then,the metal plates are preparated by skilled machinists.And then, the sheets are printed,operator should pay attention to the colour on both sides,special ink,and images slightly raised. As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I have found that computers are vital in everyday assignments. Essays are now typed and not handwritten and projects are displayed on flash drives, not posterboard. Those advances have shaped our lives, and made everything much easier. Volleyball its my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I were in another world, in which I can be free and happy, apart of this, when I am bad, this is a distration of the university. With modern technology, the world is better connected and united. In addition to students, doctors also greatly benefit from computers. Technology has re-shaped the medical world dramatically with x-rays, @CAPS2's, surgeries and medicines. Amazingly, computers allow doctors and nurses to look at patients in a whole new way. Hospitals organize all records digitally to help give the right treatments patients. @PERSON1, the head surgean at @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""@CAPS3 technology, our @ORGANIZATION2 would be useless. We wouldn't be able to do anything."" @CAPS4 @PERSON1 is well-spoken, he makes a very important point. Computers are the building blocks of our medical world. Scientific studies have shown that the internet has brought people closer than ever before. Families separated by thousands of miles now have the ability to email, chat or even video chat with far away relatives and friends. Email has especially played a huge roll in our society, so as to help millions of people communicate when needed. Infact, over @NUM1 million jobs rely on email to communicate important business information. @CAPS3 the aid of technology, our economy would rapidly as communication countries failed to exist. Computers are essential to our culture. I strongly urge you to consider my opinion on the benefits of modern technology and think of all the people computers have helped. Our culture is now bigger, better, faster and stronger, thanks to the help of technology today. Knowing this, I vehimently suggest you educate others in the benefit of technology and play your part in advancing our way of living."	4.5
634	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Smoking is extremely harmful to health. It is harmful to not only the smokers, but also the people around them. Because of this, smoking is banned at most of the restaurants in Taiwan now. I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens.So I do not agree with this afirmation, in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport. They can welcome the customers who smoke, or they can put a ban on smoking. However, restaurants should have a post on the door to let the customers know whether they can smoke here. If a person who doesn't smoke sees the post that smoking is permitted in a restaurant, he would not go in and have a meal. Reversely, if a person doesn't care the smell of smoke, even if smoking is permitted in a restaurant, he can still have a meal there. Besides, restaurants can be parted into smoking area and nonsmoking area. To sum up, the most important thing is that restaurants should mark clearly whether customers can smoke in the restaurant. Then customers can decide where they want to go. If a restaurant loss their customers by letting people smoke, they would afterward put a ban on smoking. Hence I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."	4.5
635	"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"Laughter--as we all know @CAPS4--is a visual expression of happiness, or in inward feeling of joy. Nowadays, public transport is used for many people in the cities, we can find different types of them, such as bus tube and train, but is there a future for it or not?, I am going to respond this question giving disadvantanges and advantages and  finally I give my personal opinion. @CAPS4 is in most cases, a very pleasant sensation. By that means, laughing has an enormous impact on each and every one of us throughout our everyday lives. Laughter tends to enlighten our emotions by expressing them in many good, cheerful, and lastly, positive ways. However, @CAPS4 is proven that laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze.When laughter is shared, @CAPS4 binds people together and increases the intimacy and happiness. Around @TIME1--which happens to be exactly when my third period class begins, I was supposed to be in my @CAPS1 class at the time, but with my luck--I wasn't. You are probably thinking, ""@CAPS2, if she is not in her third period class, then where is she?"" I actually ended up in the computer lab, beginning my state writing test once again. I defiantly wasn't too thrilled about taking the writing test over again, but in my heart, I knew deep down inside that I could pass the state writing test this time without any if, and, or buts, which are also known as the worst things ever--excuses. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that I was going to walk out of the room, realizing that I could of done better--that's for sure. My self confidence was set to an exceedingly high standard with absolutely no negatives thoughts to think of. Our Mistakes mistake made us better than before if in life we had't got any mistake  we wouldn't succeed that's why  the mistakes are very important in life and I believe  our mistake improve us so but in another way there just one mistake and you could not come back or arranged your mistake As soon as I entered the computer lab, I almost nearly sat down as fast as a fly trying to dodge a fly swatter. I took an immense deep breath--like usual, and began to log into the computer. In between the time I was waiting for my computer to get logged in, I sat there gazing around the room, with nothing more to do, then to visualize what I was going to type my state writing test about. Once the teacher approved my log-in, I started typing all of my private information into the blank squares, so that I could begin my next steps.Within seconds I was ready to begin my test. On the screen appeared several topics that were listed below to choose from, but there was only one of them that I felt most satisfied with, and that I felt I could score exceedingly high in. The topic was, ""We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was on element or part."" The minute I selected that subject, I honestly had no idea what I was going to write about because during my childhood life I had numerous laughter moments that had occurred, and nearly every story that I could remember had to of been more than @NUM1 words. So, I quietly sat there thinking-- just how I knew I would be. When I want studying for exams  going to the living room and sitting front of TV In addition, there is a small blackboard for my littel brother because my mother wants my prother learn Arabic and English letters. @CAPS4 was very obvious that the students understood their topic quite @CAPS2--unlike me. Minutes had flew by so quickly, and yet, still nothing. Not a single story to share about laughter. By then, I was very upset with myself, because if you really think about @CAPS4, who does not have a story to write about that deals with laughter? I knew I had some sort or kind of story to share, @CAPS4 was just harder for me to summarize one up and type about @CAPS4. Just then, as I was going to begin my essay, a younger student, (that had been taking a state reading test), loudly shouted, ""@CAPS3!"" The little kid not only caught myself, but the rest of the class as @CAPS2. I honestly swear @CAPS4 was a ""had to of been there moments."" @CAPS4 wasn't just for the fact that he said @CAPS3 exceedingly loud, but the expression that was on his face, and the way he announced @CAPS4 to everyone in the computer lab--@CAPS4 nearly killed me inside. The little boy was so thrilled and proud of himself that he had passed. Obviously he was very eager to let the entire class know--which is probably something I would have done as @CAPS2. Almost as quickly as he announced @CAPS4, I knew this was a laughing moment to not only remember, but to share with others as @CAPS2. In fact, if truth be told, this short story just so happened to not only make my day, but he had made my state writing assessment topic many times less stressing for me. Clearly as you can see, laughing indeed does seem to have an enormous impact on each and everyone of us throughout our everyday lives, and sometimes those moments are meant to be shared."	4.5
636	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Friends’ Influence on Young Adult Age
When people graduate high school and become young adults, they go through lots of psychological changes. They want to get out of the shadows of their parents and try to do things by themselves. Some people say that family is the most important influence on young adults; however, others say that friends are the most important influence. In my opinion, in the age of young adults, friends have the greatest influence on them for several reasons. First of all,  young adults spend most of their study time with friends. They were talking about their lives and  he remembered like he knew her on the bus, maybe  she have always been the woman of his live he looked at eyes and smile he wants to ask her whether now is not late to satart to know her but he decided leave the pub he walked to exit. Therefore, although they graduated high school, they still have to spend a lot of time studying. They study in classrooms, libraries, and dormitories, so they are always with their friends. By spending lots of time together, they naturally have a lot of influence on each other. In addition to studying, young adults give and take advice from their friends. Generally, friends have similar age with them; therefore, they have similar worries. By talking and sharing their thoughts with friends, young adults can find answers of their worries. For example, most of male young adults in Korea have worries about military. Some of them go to military at the age of 20 and others go to military at the age about 30. Sharing their experiences and thoughts about military can make them have better choice. Lastly, young adults enjoy leisure with friends a lot. Some say, as young adults, people should spend lots of time with their parents and siblings. They think spending time with family is most valuable; however, nowadays, most of young adults enjoy leisure time with friends. Since, friends have similar mindsets and similar physical abilities, it is more fun to play with friends. Accordingly, friends give more entertaining leisure time for them. To sum up, friends have the most important influence on young adults. They study with friends, give and take advice with friends, and enjoy leisure time with friends. To my mind our lives has been improved in these years by smarphone, satnav, digital TV, Internet.. Let's suppose a teenager of twenty-first century during the Middle ages.. don't get out alive without Wi-fii! Therefore, friends, who have similar values and thoughts, can be the best companion. When becoming young adults, they should spend as much time as possible with their frie"	4.5

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Censorship in libraries is a very controversial topic that has conflicting views. One side, in favor of censorship, believes that some literary material contained within a library could be offensive to some, and that it should be removed or censored. The other side, in favor of free speech, believes that all literary material in a library should be kept, whether it is seen as offensive or not. Of these two sides of such a controversial issue, it is evident that censorship should not be instilled within libraries, because of the right to free speech, the true meanings and expressions must be upheld, and it would take the oppurtunity to read such a work truly from an interested reader. The first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because of the right to free speech. Second advantage is Internet by website, such as twiter, facebook... You allow speak with your quick friend, or you can meet ith them by website, therefore you do not call by telephone, so internet is too much cheap. I have observed that many people will often attempt to steal this right from people, and this instillation of censorship will do just that to the authors. This is the first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor. In later time, society feel the need for change about iniquities that pass in the country and the Mexican Revolution explotes, the building is abandoned because the government and country dont have money for construction, to the point the building  metal estructure was used as weapons. An example of a story that would suffer from censorship is the famous 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1.' Such a novel, though containing offensive language at times, would not read the same if such language was omitted and removed. Instead, @PERSON1's expressions within the story would be dulled down immensely and be nearly silenced. This is the next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor. The last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because it removes the availability of the book from an interested reader. Many times I have seen people blatantly have a tantrum over an offensive literary work. I have been offended by things that I have read before, and instead of demanding its removal and crying for a less offensive substitute, I simply either stopped reading the work or read through it anyways. A person must know that the use of offensive language within literary works rarely is intended to attack the reader, but rather to strongly get a point across. If a person finds the material too offensive to read, then they should simply stop and find a more suitable work. By remaining calm and passive about these things, it keeps the literary work on the shelves in its true form for other people who wish to read it.This is the last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor. It is clearly evident that the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is a bad idea as a whole. The decision to censor literary works would be bad because it would strip the author's right to free speech, it would dull down the author's true meanings and expressions, and it would remove the oppurtunity to read such a work from an interested person. The removal or censorship of literary works would be a terrible decision that all would regret in the years to come. This is why the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is an unjust endeavor."	4.5
638	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Recently, there has been debate about whether or not computers benefit society. Although each side has its own reasons, computers do have a positive effect on people and on society. Computers are beneficial in several ways. With the use of computers, you have the ability to research and learn about foreign and local places you are able to communicate with others and the help people complete everyday tasks. At one point in everyone's lives, you need to know about local or even foreign places. It is completely unrealistic for someone to travel to every place they need to know about. This is where computers come in. Over the internet, you can research everything from the main staple of the diet in @LOCATION3 all the way to the day the new year in @LOCATION1. You learn about things in the comfort of your home, or of your home town. I rember once in @NUM1 grade I had to do a research project on @LOCATION2. By going on the computer, I learned all I needed to know and they some. The project was a breeze, and I got a perfect score. Also, you can learn about local upcoming events, and about the world around you. During childhood, every kid has many questions, some their parents might not be able to answer. Using the computer is a quick and easy way to get these answers. Computers help educate the minds of people and without them, we might not know anything. I'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant its name is ""Lemon"" I go there every week it has different food from any restaurants I'd like chicken crispy with garlic sauce It's Excellent choice for me and My favorite appitizer is susage and in order that desert I'd rather ""Vadge"" cake with chocolate sauce I feel I;m at ease when I go there I enjoy  classical music over having a lunch about the service It's very good and all staff are respectable I can't imagine one week without going there that drives me nuts I advise any one to go there and enjoy  a time there , also this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really It's  excellent This strikingly thing for anyone  despite all of these advantages prices are not expensive . Mailing a letter could take weeks to reach the recipiant. Computers provide us with a imediate method of communicating with others whether they are local or far away. Last year, my uncle moved to @LOCATION3 for work. I never got to see him.We communicated with each other over computers, and when he came home for christmas, we were as close to each other as we were before he work. Computers kept our relationship healthy and I do not think it would have been that way without them. Scientists say that about @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS1 have communicated with someone at least once through computers. They also say that @PERCENT2 of these people regurally use this method of communicating. Although we still use phones and ""shall mail"", I do not believe that our society would be able to function socially without the availiable use of computers. Everyday, computers are helping people get through their days with minimal problems. People get things done quicker, giving people more time to do what matters most, interacting with their families. Without computers, everyday business would take about twice as long leaving less time for the fun things in life. @PERSON1, my neighboor, said ""@CAPS2 and banking are so time consuming. I do not know that I would be able to handle it without the ability to do my banking online."" In addition to takes and hancing, computers help with everything from shopping to woking for the perfect phone company to use for your new business. Having the ability to shop and browse online takes away ariving, walking and checkout line time letting you relax and take your time throughout the rest of your day. Typing also gives you hand-eye coordination without it, you wouldn't be able to do everyday things such as opening the door to playing sports outside with your children using computers helps people get through their lives easier and more efficiently, I could not even imagine life without them. Computers benefit the people of society in every possible way. Negaticvs about the online lerning are dat your not listening to much from ea real person and more from a Computer, if you dont have any listening things in the app you dont lern how to pronounce the words. Computers have a great effect on people and should continue to be used in everyday society."	4.5

"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 it has been brought to my attention that why on a nice sunny day like this somebody would want to be inside. The sad truth is that too many people are wasting their time inside on their computers, rather than enjoying the day. Computers are negatively affecting the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 population. We are getting to a point where our whole world might be absolutley crazy if nothing is done about this. For one the @LOCATION1 has the most obese children in the world. Generally children should be running around burning off their calories; even some people in their teen years should. Instead kids are sitting in front of computer screens on their virtual games and emails and such. Even doing chores around the house could bring down the obesity rate a lot more then sitting on your butt staring at a screen all day. The whole screen thing brings me to my next point. Staring at those bright flashy lights for too long is not good for your brain, what computers cause @NUM1 out of @NUM2 child ceizures a year. The radioactivity in a computer could also mess you up a lot by giving you cancer, with no cure for any cancer yet you have to figure that everytime you are on that computer for too long you are putting your life at risk. The longer youre on the more and more and more radiation is going to youre brain. Do you really want to cut your life short knowing you are the one that did it to yourself, it could almost be called suicide because if youre reading this than you've been warned. I reduce use of innecesary power at home, in other words,I turn on light that I need for the while i use it;I take less warm shower; I hit only neccesary rooms. The computer can also effect you mentally and socially. When @DATE1 comes along you will have all the time in the world to be on the computer but did you know over vacation you lose @PERCENT1 of everything you learned in school. Its been proven that computers cause memory loss. So what if you get back to school and you can't keep up with what's going on, frustrating isn't it? If you would've just read a book during the time you were on the computer maybe you could've gained knowledge rather than using it. Computers can affect you socially because not everybody wants to sit inside on the computer so while people are out having fun, you will be all alone, by yourself with nobody to talk to but a computer, would you like a computer to be your only friend? The debate about this topic could rage on and on for days and still have no winner but in all honesty when you go to turn on that computer think to yourself, is it really worth it? Think of everything you would lose, everything you could never get back, or would you rather do something that you would gain from in the future. More environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of themthere is to that we have a center of care and, other more institutions, we also make environmental protection centers were people can visit and learn about this to sum up our village is very concentrated on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us"	4.5
640	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"As the computers being propagated to most of the people from the very first of 21st century, the argument on whether the computers have made our life easier or more complex is rising. Some argue that computers have made life more complex and stressful, yet some others oppose to that opinion. I believe that computers have made our life easier and more convenient for couple of reasons. ; it is available to do complex works, it is easy to record, and it people must follow the development of technology. Firstly, the computers have made it available to do complex works that cannot be done by human. Works such as making charts, calculating and solving complex problems, and editing pictures and videos are the complex works that cannot be conducted or too hard to do without computers. For example, nowadays computers calculate the infinite number 'pi' to the tremendous number of digits. Additionally, it is easy to justify this reason even not looking at the history before the computer has been invented. By comparing the capability between the computer of 2000 and 2020, the complex works mentioned above are now done in much less time. The village I live, there is a lot of vegetation for that reason we try to protect environment, some of the things we do is to give mantainance every week to the vagetation zone checking if there is any garbage, to avoid this we teach the younger´s enviromentalist actions so they don´t throw cans,paper,or,candies to the floor they also can help the older people, there are cases which a person throws garbage to the street´s,floor or to the vegetation to avoid that happening again we have a punishment that is to pay some money if the don´t they wont be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again, unless they were visitors, in that case we told him or her the way we live in the village and, we give him or her advises to keep a beautiful place without garbage. Before the computers were invented, people needed to record everything by writing on a paper with a pen or by using typing machine and print on a paper right away. In this method, people should have made copies by repeating the same work in order to save the document safely. However, data on the computer do not get ripped, burnt, or wet and vanish. In some cases, the data can be destroyed by some possibilities; the possibilities are situations like light out or error of the computer itself. Nevertheless, using the internet network through computer will help to save the data in the cloud service which is safe from it. Even there are advantages of computers such as things mentioned before, some argue that people who didn't learn computer cannot do anything. However, following the flow of technology development is inevitable in modern society: Learning computers are thing that must be done in this society. To sum up, computers have made people's life more convenient in the stance of works that can be done with computers and the stability of saving the data. People can travel through the city easily and safely.For instance Melbourn,the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area.Therefore people don't need to drive cars for travelling in the city.The last point is people go for long journey by public transport.Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive. For these reasons, I think that there are more advantages given by computers than disadvantages."	4.5
641	University: Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Only good students should attend college
These days, many people think that graduating from university is necessary, so they talk about what level of students should be allowed to attend college. Some people believe that a college education should be available to all students. We separated paper from glass and also to plastic.The garbage picks up paper once a week,plastic two times at month and undiferretiated three times a week to all people who live in my country.My district makes clean my village and it usually tries to make attractive with new social initiatives for the community. First of all, a class is more suitable for students. If the college is open to all students, there will be students of various levels. Their level of knowledge and understanding will vary widely, so it will be difficult to set the level of the class and proceed. When the student’s levels are somewhat high and constant, they will be able to have a more appropriate education and improve their knowledge. In addition to suitable education, student’s knowledge can be improved through competition. If students have similar knowledge level and when they are all study hard, they will compete among themselves. Through competition, students will study harder and concentrate on their studies to fill their shortcomings. Some people argue that allowing only good students to attend college is unfair. While it is true that everyone should have the same opportunity. However, the quality of education and atmosphere of class should be guaranteed because students pay tuition fees. When only good students attend to college, the atmosphere of the class is even better because students who want to study hard gathered. To sum up, limiting the level of students who can attend college is important for students. Students can take classes that fit their levels, and they can compete each other and develop themselves. Therefore, higher education should be available only to good students."	4.5
642	"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"As I waited in the car, anxious to meet my best friend and man I'm in love with, I started to laugh. Not because something my mother or brother said was funny, or because I saw something funny, but I was nervous. I'd talked to him countless times on the phone, many many text messages, and countless emails. But I was still nervous. I knew him better than I knew most people, yet my anxiety seemed to be making me lose my sanity. As our black rental sedan pulled up to where he was waiting outside of where his family lived, I got more nervous. @CAPS6 if he wasn't actually the way I thought he was? @CAPS6 if he didn't like me? @CAPS6 if I didn't like him? As soon as he stepped into the car, smiling brightly at me, my nervous laughter and my anxiety all melted away. I smiled back. ""@CAPS1, @PERSON1,"" he said. ""@CAPS1 @PERSON2,"" I said, butterflies in my stomach. I was smiling broadly still, he reached out and cautiously took my hand. ""@CAPS3 was the drive?"" he asked, lightly squeezing my hand. ""@CAPS4, and nerve wracking,"" I replied, nervous laughter bubbling up again. ""@CAPS5 your here now, and I'm very happy @CAPS7 are,"" he said, smiling. And for the rest of the car ride to the restaurant our conversation flowed so smoothly I thought I was dreaming. Here him and I were two guys in love with one another, a new thing for both of us, and we were happy as can be. The whole car ride we held hands ad talked, I felt like I'd known him my whole life. Not just the year and a half I'd known him. We arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 all too fast and all of us got out of the car, I was famished and so was he. But we had to wait for a table for a half-hour before we sat down. Once at the dinner table my mother, who was very happy I found someone I loved so much and knew of our love, started regaling us with tales of my childhood. Fortunately  Kabul structured  by Mountains and have mountainous climate, approximately this town  have 15 (mm) Raining per year the remarkable Agricultural area and forestry all around the town have a positive effect for the Kabul city environment and producing  Fresh air for the citizens of the mentioned town I was bright red for almost the entire time she told these stories. Some of which I remembered, others I did not. @PERSON2 laughed and joked wth me about all of them. Which made my nervous laughter come out as actual laughter. So I do not have opptunity to practical English Because most of my colleagues speak French.They speak French in the meeting, in the gearm, and in the shopping After we ate dinner and dessert we went to the nearby mall for some shopping and to just hang out. My mom and brother went one way, and @PERSON2 and I went another. We bought some clothes together and finally ended up in a book store. My favorite book store, @ORGANIZATION3's. Back in my favorite section, young adult fiction, I noticed @PERSON2 staring at me. ""@CAPS6?"" I asked stupidly. He smiled deviously. ""@CAPS7 just look very... In your element,"" he smirked. ""@CAPS8?"" I said, in mock confusion. He just smiled and took my hand in his again. ""@CAPS9 problem,"" he said, squeezing my hand. He pulled me closer to him, we were the only people in this area of the store. ""@CAPS10 if I'm a little forward?"" he asked. I shook my head @CAPS9. He leaned in and kissed me very gently on the lips, I blushed a bright red and started to giggle after our lips parted. He quirked an eyebrow, I knew @CAPS6 he was thinking just by the look on his face. ""That felt fantastic,"" I said, putting my fingers on my lips. I had a silly grin on my face. ""@CAPS11,"" he simply said, kissing me again. ""I love your laugh, love,"" he told me, I was on cloud nine, I was truly in love with somebody and I felt great! However if this situation not change and if our government not take providence about this important subject will be the end of the transport public and will more convenient to use car. So,my favourite sport in the present time it is street workout.I have been exercising this sport already long time.I like to exercise on the street even in the season when the temperature outside below zero.Of course, in summer I like to exercise more than in winter but this don't stop me.I don't know myself why,but I almost every day go on the street in order to exercise.If  It is very coldly and windily outside,I don't worry about it and I'm exsercising at home.For those people, who want to start to exercise the street workout I'm advising to start with basic exerscises such as pull ups,push ups,dips and squats.That everything basic exercises and they will help you will do a good start up.After some time when you will be feeling that you are ready for more, you can start to study more difficult exercises. But this was definitely better, because it could last much longer. Which it has, since we've been together ever since. The diabetes is the increasing  of the glucosa in the blood, The have two types, first the Diabetes Type 1 that is predent in childrens, pacient needs insuline every day, also this diabetes is caused by the destruction of the insuline realized by the person´s immuny siste. Now whenever I remember that I was start to giggle happily to myself. Yes I get a stare every once in a while, but I don't care. Laughter is the thing that helped bridge the gap between him and I. It was a cold day at night when I was at home watching my favourite programme on my telly called ""dare to win"", I was with my brother, when we decided to call, The programme is about questions for the contestants that must be answer in correct time, and there is a different things for the winner."	4.5

"finally ,a public transport need more costs , because public transport (such a buses , train ) fees every year is increasing, and this problem we do not face it by private transport , That is why, I honestly believe computers do not benefit my community. For instance, computers can be very dangerous and people these days just seem to spend too much time using them! Not to mention, computers cost way too much money. To begin, my mom and dad always say, ""don't talk to strangers,"" when I go out. I think they should say the same when I go to use my computer. Computers can truly be dangerous for someone who isn't careful. For example, online predators often depict themselves as someone they aren't. Therefore, you can't ever really trust someone you simply met in a chat room. Also, cyber bullying is another problem computers put people at risk for. Another danger computers have, is anything posted on the internet can be accessed by almost anyone. This includes pictures, blogs, comments and. I believe society would be better off without the constant worry of a computer! Secondly, people, especially the younger generation, spend excessive amounts of time on computers. Some people spend hours each day using a computer when they could be doing an activity that actually benefited them. So for finish competition with pleasure I needed work out plan witch is diary day by day about our jogging distance, time, mood during work out. Not to mention, it would bring people closer to one another. Computers seem to control peoples' lives and that just isn't healthy. I think people should spend more time living and less time with their faces glued to a computer screen! Lastly, computers are like vampires, sucking away your money. In @DATE1's economy people need to be saving their money for college or even simpler things like a new pair of shoes! Additionaly, at the rate that technology is advances, even the most high-tech computers are out of date in a year or two and a new one is needed. Also, computers' prices are constantly rising. It is very hard to keep up! I strongly believe computers are a waste of money and bring society down. All in all, computers just are a negative attribute in communities across the @LOCATION1. First off they can be dangerous. Secondly, they are too time consuming and, thirdly, computers are too expensive. Computers just simply are a hassle in @DATE1's world."	4.5

"For example, the planetarium in a navigate room for learnt about the position of star, four small boats use for practiced the leadership and navigation in Pontevedra  river, or even the simulation for maked the situations which are seldom happen. Deajeon is peaceful and quiet city. In addition, Daejeon is called science capital city since many research centers, including KAIST, are located in Daejeon. Therefore, it is the best city for research or study. However, even Daejeon is great city to study, if I could change one important thing about KAIST, I want to change the location to Seoul. I will give two reasons. First, it is hard to communicate with other university students. Last year, I tried to join badminton club. I wanted to join united club that students from many universities participate. However, I could not find any club that I could join. Because most of universities and clubs are concentrated in Seoul, and there was no club for KAIST students who live in Daejeon. That shows that KAIST students are hard to communicate with others. Second, it is hard to make girl friend. 80% of KAIST student is male. Hence, it is so hard to make girl friend in KAIST. I had many girl friends before I came to KAIST. However, after I came to KAIST, I faced serious problems with making girl friend. Once, I asked my friend about how Seoul students make girl friend even most of students are male in his school. He said, they can meet outside of the school because there are many people and many place to meet outside of the school. There are less places and universities than Seoul that we can meet others in Daejeon. Thus, it is so hard to make girl friend for KAIST students. In conclusion, I would change the location of the KAIST to Seoul because of the two reasons. The first reason is communication with other university students and the second reason is making a girl friend. However, it is almost impossible to change the location. I used my car every day however few a few I started to take public transport for I can to save up money"	4.5

While libraries @MONTH1 seem to be the most unusual place to have access to these materials, many young children can checkout books that are simply not appropriate for their age. Censorship of materials, such as books, movies, and music, that are found offensive or inappropriate are a way to teach young children that life isn't all about what the media portrayes it to be. One very important reason to allow censorship of materials in libraries is that you might not know what type of book you're looking at. Many children, and adults too, walk into the library and look among the books until they see a cover or a title that grabs their attention. While most of the books in a library are age appropriate a child can still grab a book that isn't something they should be reading. There are mass amounts of influential materials from the media and also from peers that a child is subject to. Censorship in a library will make it a safer place for children to go and pick up any book in the proper section for them and will also allow the @CAPS1 to not have to worry about what their child has selected. he took the money the second day , he finished the registration and started in writing the story after long time spending in writing and did good job he went to give his story to the international student magazine office ,he found out there are a notice on the door say that the competition has canceled, he came back vey sad and told me what happened .Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake . @CAPS1 should never have to worry about what their child can get ahold of in a public library. A second reason to allow censorship in libraries is that video stores already have censorship in their shops, along with ratings on all their movies and video games. Most video stores have a seperate section of movies that are deemed to have 'adult content' in them. A minor cannot walk into a movie store and go to the section of movies deemed for adults, or someone over the age of eighteen. A minor can't rent an @CAPS2-rated movie without proving that they are seventeen, or they have an adult to rent it for them. The same thing occurs with video games, for example a video game with a rating of @CAPS3, or mature, cannot be rented or bought by anyone under the age of eighteen. @CAPS5 censorship should be applied to libraries. Having seperate sections based on adult content allow movies and books to be set in a seperate location so that no child can possibly rent something that they have no intention of watching or reading. @CAPS5 type of censorship also allows for a parent to choose if their child can see it. An example of @CAPS5 would be for a sixteen year old boy. While he cannot go and rent the @CAPS2-rated movie, if his @CAPS1 deem it acceptable for him to see, then they can rent it for him. @CAPS5 gives the parent control of what their child sees, instead of the child having full control. It is a time when children must choose, which people are good or bad, which way they will go to difficult situation for example they will be drink alcohol or they will have fun without any suplements. Perhaps the most important reason for censorship in libraries is the early exposure the materials give to the children. Many young children have been watching television shows or hearing things on the news that make it seem acceptable in our society to drink at parties when you're not of age, do illegal drugs for the feeling, and have sex at an extremely young age because it's what 'everyone's doing.' @CAPS5 is a very risky path to let the young children in our society take. Allowing our culture to become @CAPS5 way can lead to various sorts of problems, as we have seen all to well. Many young kids, some as young as fourteen or fifteen years old, go to parties and drink. When it comes to getting a ride home they go with their seventeen-year-old friend who has a license, and who has also been drinking at the party. Now hopefully the story ends that all of the children make it home safely, but that is not how it works in many cases. There have been so many drunk driving crashes recently in our nation with children who should not have even been drinking. @CAPS5 ties back to censorship because of the way these kids were pressured into drinking. Many adults in the society blame it on peer pressure; but where do the peers get the idea that @CAPS5 is acceptable? These ideas come from the influences that the society's children are susceptable to. Censorship in libraries is one way of restricting the ideas children are exposed to, and hopefully allowing them lead safer and healtheir lives. While there are so many other factors in the exposure to children of these materials, stopping the exposure in libraries is one way of eradicating early exposure. Young children in today's society and culture are exposed to excessive amounts of inappropriate materials. These three factors, the inability to know what you might be checking out at the library, the fact that video stores already have censorship, and the unecessary exposure to young children, all lead to the need for censorship in libraries. And to day is necessary because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversation with their you need to now more than your foreign language, because in the rest of the world and particularly in Europe people now more than two language and that great. While some @MONTH1 see these books or movies as their own freedom to speech the truth is that it is harming the society, hence the need for censorship in libraries and other places where children have access to movies, books, magazines, music, and video games. Removing the offensive books, magazines, and movies from shelves in libraries around the country will lead to a safer culture for children to grow up in, and a society where things such as drugs, alcohol, and sex aren't condoned near as often"	4.5
646	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @CAPS1 news editors, @CAPS2, my name is @PERSON1, and I would like you to write an article on the effects computers have on people. Computers have been the technological item to have over the past @NUM1 or so years. They allow people to learn many new skills, get important work done, and even socialize! Life is unpredictable and unforseen.The immense possibilities of life  give us opportunity to explore life but some times   it lead to threat and dangers to our life.We surely pray for the best life of our dear and near ones.But insurance is also necessity and invetable for peace of mind .It gives us surety to live life securely.It just not only to save our life but also secure assets like houses cars etc. Everyone wants to be healthy. While computers are fun and useful, could they have a negative effect on society? @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are employed as of @DATE1, and with that number dropping people need to get more work done to keep their jobs, or even keep their businesses open. With computers available at work (or school) much more work can be done, with programs like @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 people can type reports, and with programs like @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2, and iCalculator, workers can calculate taxes faster, so they have more time to work. Some people are working with stocks, and these days, the stocks could be good or bad, so you need to keep up! You can go to the stock websites and control what you buy and sell, without raising you phone bill from calling the brokers. Laptops make work possible on the go to! Computers teach many skills you need to know for jobs, and other skills you @MONTH1 need times in life. You can learn typing, work programs, and programing which are all needed in some lines of work. Computers increase math skills and hand eye coordination to! FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY´S all begins in 1981 when freddy fazbear's pizza open, the establishment it's a pizza restaurant but this pizza restaurant in had robots, in 1981 there were four animatronics and their names are Chica , Foxy, Bonnie and Freddy. Well, you can’t online scans, and some are free! Not only do computers teach skills and work, they are very fun too! Between @CAPS6, twitter, email, googleBUZZ, mySpace, ooVoo, skype and gamesradar, there are lots of ways to talk to friends and meet new people. On @CAPS6 I can have up to @NUM2 people talk to whenever I want! Why not talk to real people? you ask, well the answer is simple, maybe it is a lazy @DATE2 and nobody wants to go out anywhere, or maybe your friends want to talk right before bed time. Talking to real people is important, but can’t be done all the time! Online gaming has become an sensation!, and not only an @NUM3, @NUM4 and @CAPS8, @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 can “game” too! Good morning everyone,today I want to share about is my favorite sport.My favorite sport is football,why I choose it?Well,football is a international sport,people around the world will love it so much!Example like Barclay Premier League,Liga Premier,Fifa World Cup and so on.I believe that's all will delighted us.By the way,my favorite football team is Manchester United,they are brilliant,they have an amazing football players,and they are awesome. Some people think gaming is a waste of time, but the same can be said for any indoor leisure activity, everybody needs a fun activity they can do anytime! Besides everybody likes having fun! Some people believe the ludicrous notion that technology is making @LOCATION1 into fat, lifeless losers, but, it is opposite, you can socialize online and meet new people. People (like myself) can balance computers and games, with exercize and sports. With computers you can efficently complete work and learn new skills! Computers are posotive if used correctly. I hope you like this artice, thanks for reading."	4.5
647	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"There are things in this world that are relative. Censorship is one of them. Relative means that one person has a different view than that of another. The future for the public transport shouldn't be  taken lightly,  in my opinion, the public transport is the best option for ending the problems with the traffic jam because when we use a bus or subway , a lot of people is travelling from one place at other in only one transport or vehicle. One phrase that is very important to censorship is 'things that they believe.' @CAPS1 is inappropriate to one person could be deemed viewable to another. This should not be decided by one person or even one group that believes they know @CAPS1 is socially acceptable or politically correct. Censorship in libraries are not a good thing. @PERSON3 and @CAPS2 walk into a library, and there is a magazine on the rack that depicts a person standing over a two hundred pound, twenty four point, state record, whitetail deer with with a gun in their hand. @PERSON3 is a firm believer in providing for his family and the rights given to an individual in the second ammendment of the @LOCATION1 constitution. cell phone I chose this invention that I think that helped to humanity to communicate more easily,  Motorola It was the first doing something to a mobile phone  was on 3 April 1973 the first to do so was an employee of Martin Cooper Cooper made mobile phone history in April 1973 when he made the first ever call on a handheld mobile phone After that, with the new technology they could invent new and better dispositives for the needs of users  ""taken from https://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/guides/history-of-mobile-phones/"" For some there is pride in harvesting an animal and knowing that they provided that meat. @PERSON3 will see the magazine as an opportunity. He might learn tips from the magazine, or find some new gear that he thinks could be useful. @CAPS2 on the other hand is a conservative. She believes killing is wrong and inhumane. She goes to the store and buys her meat from the freezer section. But i know that a lot of joung people play tennis, i hope that the italian tennis player in a few years  will be very famous all over the world , then you don't wait you sign up in a tennis club and you will become a famous tennis player! She will view this magazine as inappropriate. Again, censorship is relative to the person looking over the material. Does that mean that just because @CAPS2 thinks the magazine is inappropriate, it should be taken off of the shelf so that someone like @PERSON3 can not read it, appreciate it, and gain knowledge from it? That choice is up to @CAPS2 not to read the magazine, not to the librarian. @CAPS2 is responsible for her own views and choices. She is entitled to them. @PERSON3 is entitled as well. Leave the choice to the reader. Over in the book section there are @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. @PERSON1 is a fanatic for science and history. as I worked in restaurant kitchen as a part-time job,how I gathered knowledge of basic cooking methods, hope it may helpful for now! At the end of the row, on top of the shelf sits a book on the topic of evolution. @PERSON1 belives this theory and sees the book as interesting. @PERSON2 looks at the book and thinks to himself, 'That stuff is not true. Why would anyone waste their time reading it.' Does that mean that the book should be taken off the shelf because @PERSON2 will not read it. @PERSON2 should just walk away from it. If he chooses not to, that is up to @PERSON2. Leave that choice to @PERSON2. Up at the desk there are the librarians.They have their views and opinions and are entitled to them as well. But the books, music, movies, and magazines that are displayed  for checking out should not be chosen because he or she likes them or opposes them, but because someone might be looking for the information in that material. If the choice is left to them that material might not be available to the reader that needs it. Censorship is a terrible thing for libraries. It takes material away from people that can be useful. Censorship, along with many other things is relative. @CAPS1 one person @MONTH1 deem inappropriate could be viewed as totally fine with another person. Based on moral values, character, and opinions developed with progression of life, people have made judgements on @CAPS1 is appropriate or unacceptable. That choice to look at that magazine, read that book, or listen to that song should be left up to them, not made for them."	4.5

"Imagine standing outside, the warm sun dancing on your back, jumping into the pool and feeling the cool water flow around you. But no, that won't happen. Because children and their parents are spending way to much time on their computers. People aren't getting enough excercise, it can be very dangerous and families are spending less time with each other without computers, so its worse with them. I think people need to realize that computers are over the humans. In all over the world people always need advices to keep looking after their environments .First ,the municipal should do workshops in schools and universities providing students by tips that should help us to make our environment clean .Second ,they should make awareness campaigns about environment ;for example , telling people to put their rubbish in waste papre basket which helping workers to recycling it easily .Finally ,to stay healthy we need a healthy environment . But with computers that isn't really possible. More and more children are becoming obese by the year. Computers are making that happen quicker. Instead of sitting at the computer eating potato chips, children should be outside on their bikes, or swimming, or playing sports with their friends. If it is winter, the least kids could do is go sledding. Children need to expirience nature, not the screen of a computer. Some people say that a tripp by car is more convenient that by the public transportation, but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations.It is true that travel to a nearby place from your city, it  is more comfortable getting there by car, and the ease of have your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time paying  cabs. @NUM1 year olds are making facebooks! You can find @NUM2 year old on the internet now. Naive teenagers go find ""friends"" in chatrooms or on @CAPS2, and their ""friends"" lie to them, about their age, another indentity. Many teenagers go and meet someone they met online and end up getting raped or killed. There are many sick people in the world, and many of them use the internet to find people. Lots of teenagers give out personal information like their last name, cellphone number, or where they live, and thats an easy way for predators to find them. It puts them, and their whole family in danger. Computers are breaking up families, and friends. Things like @CAPS1, @CAPS2,@CAPS3, farmpring, @CAPS4, etc. are turning people against each other. Some families even eat dinner at the computer. When friends go over other friend's houses, they just sit on the computer. Why is it so fun to just look at the computer screen? Families need to do something together like eat dinner together, go out for ice cream, go shopping, something, anything but going on the computer all day. I'll admit, I am a little addicted to the computer. But I don't go on it @NUM3, like some people. Them they drink a cafe that give them many energy to construct faster the building, this café has a combination for the people can to live all the night. Instead of online shopping, go shopping with your friends. It isn't hard to at back @NUM4 or @NUM5 hours of going on the computer. Am I the only teenager who thinks this? Maybe. But I know that I am benefitting myself by cutting back on the computer. We don't get enough exercise, it can become really dangerous, and family and friends should start spending more time together. Computers can do everything more than humans can, and we need to stop it."	4.5
649	"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"Many people love to laugh and others just don't like it as much. But in some day tow guise with quad bike and they saw some thing wrong they sad what's that , they sow dead body , they skared and run to ther camp . I believe that it's important to laugh because it just feels good, it makes you feel that everything is going okay. With the people that you can laugh the most with are obviously your @CAPS1. When you are feeling down who is there to support you, your @CAPS1 are, and what they try to do is to make you laugh. My best friend @PERSON3 and I have the tendency to always laugh, especially if we have a class together it's all about laughter. We have fun in class, we do pay attention but we just make it interesting and we just laugh so much that it can distract others. Our teacher from sophomore year @PERSON1 always told us that we're very giggly and that it was a good thing. She also told us that she had never seen anyone laugh so much in her class. For example that year we were studying vocabulary and when @PERSON3 and I saw the word countenance we started laughing so much because it means the face and it reminded us about the tv show @CAPS1. Every time that word came up during that week we would laugh so hard that our stomachs started to hurt. It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swimming and also when the age become older it will be more difficult to learn than the little . Even now that we're juniors we still remember that and we just start laughing so hard that it gets to the point that if I'm standing up I will let myself drop to the floor and move my feet as if i was kicking something. Now that's when my @CAPS1 start laughing more because they say I'm hilarious. @PERSON3 and I are the kind of people that if something is very boring to us there has to be a way to make it fun. Good morning everyone,today I want to share about is my favorite sport.My favorite sport is football,why I choose it?Well,football is a international sport,people around the world will love it so much!Example like Barclay Premier League,Liga Premier,Fifa World Cup and so on.I believe that's all will delighted us.By the way,my favorite football team is Manchester United,they are brilliant,they have an amazing football players,and they are awesome. Like last year in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 our teacher @PERSON2 completely freaked out because @PERSON3 and I were laughing. We were paying attention but we only laughed when we were doing our work but he didn't like it. To us that class was extremely boring and we just made it fun but @PERSON2 decided to make a sitting chart. Well you would think that by having a sitting chart @PERSON3 and I wouldn't talk or laugh at all but that didn't happen. That didn't stop her or me from talking to the people around us. We would talk to them and we made class fun. When he thought that we weren't paying attention he would ask us questions and we answered them correctly. Even though @PERSON3 and I were sitting far away from each other we would move our hands around until we got each others attention and then we just started laughing because we looked funny doing all of that without saying a word. Every day when my @CAPS1 and I eat lunch at school at our usual spot we're always laughing. People that don't really know me think I'm crazy or weird but I say that I'm just myself and that I'm very optimistic. @PERSON3 and I say ""@CAPS4 sad panda's today"" we say that when we see that one of our @CAPS1 is quiet or looks sad. The most weirdest thing is that when @PERSON3 and I laugh at the same time it sounds like one laugh. The first time we realized that we had the same laugh we just started laughing even more that we couldn't even breathe. It's important to laugh because it feels so good and you feel relieved even if you're having a really bad day, like health teachers say it takes more muscles to frown then to smile."	4.5

"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Your resources, your entertainment, even your communication with people might be fading. @CAPS8 you know a large portion of people think this @PERSON2 is harming our society. Well I will say I think they don't understand these benifit that computers bring us. Computer act like teachers teaching us without us even knowing it. Hand-eye coordination is a perfect example. Plus, we use computers to learn about places we might want to travel to, or have a conversation with frinds or family living ways away tromus. Computers is an extrodarny piece or technology. First, I like to say everything that you do physically uses hand-eye coordination. Making dinner, riding a bike, driving a car etc. And unfortiunitly not @CAPS6 people are the best at hand-eye coordination. One of @CAPS7 friends, @PERSON1, had horriable hand eye coordination. So for his birthday I decided an getting him a computer. It's been @NUM1 month since his he had his computer and @CAPS8 he was trying to hit a baseball at his sons party, he moneged to hit the ball @NUM2 out of @NUM3 where he used to hit it @NUM1 or @NUM5 out of @NUM6. @PERCENT2 is a termendous increase in only @NUM1 month! Just something @CAPS8 simple @CAPS8 a computer improved @CAPS7 friends hand-eye coordination a termendous amount. Secondly, the computer can help you learn about far away places @CAPS8 the @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION4. Do you really want to travel up to the icey cold, and piercing winds of the @LOCATION1 just to learn about it? For some I'd say like that but what if you cant travel up the @LOCATION1 due to money or flying conditions. I want to be able to study about polar bears and the glaciers without needing to worry. A statics from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 states ""@PERCENT2 of people wpould love to experience the thrill and excitement of the @ORGANIZATION1 lights. But out of those @PERCENT2 only @PERCENT3 said they'd actually travel to @LOCATION2 to see them"". So you can see that @PERCENT4 of those people wouldn't go whether it be due to money or the cold. Thery @CAPS6 said thats why they love the computer. They can experience the @ORGANIZATION1 lights without needing to travel into the bitter cold.Lastly, that better thing to do on the computer than with family you've never met before or don't get to see them. The editor for the @LOCATION3 Local states ""@CAPS7 parents live over @NUM8 miles away. I rarly get to tell to them now because I can't afford to travel that distance ofter. When you have skill to read a book and in that  moment you are searching for good job you can find  a lot  jobs because you can develop easy when you compare with another person that they have been searched  job to I notice that in supermarkets are using so much plastic just to cover a small thing or are using many plastic bags without even think how vulnerable is for the environment. @CAPS8 you can tell, thanks to the computer we talk @PERCENT1 more to his parents than he used to! Strange things happen in the house, they are ""intruders"" in the house, anne saw many times someone called victor who ""play`s"" and the mother thinks she is lyeing but after a while she believe her and started searching for the intruders. The computer teaches us hand-eye coordination, lets us learn about places we other wise would never learn about, and to have conversations with friends or family that we generally dont get to see often. Now you go out and make anyone that says computers are a horrible inventions you tell them exactly why computers are so important!"	4.5

"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that you have asked people to tell their opinions on the effects computers have on people. In my opinion computers do not have a good effect. The reason I think that is because kids are on the computer instead of doing their homework, people do not exercise as much because they are always on the computer and they do not spend as much time with their family and friends, @CAPS2 are many kids that go on the computer all night and never get to doing their homework. I read an article that said, ""Computers are the number one problem for kids not doing their homework."" People get @CAPS4 distracted on the computer that they never end up doing anything else. Eight out of ten kids say that they sometimes don't do their homework because they get distracted on the computer. I interviewed a student in the @NUM1 grade and she said, ""@CAPS3 class inastly gets all homework done but sometimes we forget when we are on the computer. The day of the competition and I came  with others  to show how I'd practiced.Then instructor said my name and I went out on the Tatami.when I left I had a special feeling many people look and clapping.It took 3 minutes I won with three accounts too.I was very happy because it was my first competition.After the end of the competition, we were all awarded medals and certificates.Then as always sounded Kazakhstan hymn. @CAPS4 computers are not a very good electronic if kids are not getting their homework done because of @CAPS1. But that is not the only bad thing about them. Since people are always on computers they don't get out and exercise as much. Instead they sit and play games on a computer. The island was flood but the island had a levee that prevent a flooding then in many year a engineers star constructing a building to had more money then in the city put many advertising in all thing : ball, balloon, movies ,etc. Nine out of ten people say that @CAPS5 since they started going on the computer a lot, they have not gone outside or exercised in a while. I interviewed a women and she said, ""I had to not go on the computer for a while because I realized that @CAPS1 was not good for me and I needed exercise."" People get @CAPS4 distracted on computers that they never go outside to exercise anymore. @CAPS2 are still some reasons why computers are not very good. Spending time with your family and friends is a very important thing to do, but with computers people to not do @CAPS1 that much anymore. In a magazine I read @CAPS1 said, ""People are not spending time with their friends and family because they are on the computer instant messaging."" Computers are keeping people from spending time together. Nine out of ten families say that they have realized they don't spent as much time together because of computers. I interviewed some kids and said, "" I don't spend a lot of time with family or friends. I am mostly on the computer instant messaging."" Computers are deffinitely not a good thing for families. Those are the reasons why I think computers do not have a good effect on people. Kids are on the computer and don't do their homework, people do not exercise as much and they don't spend as much time with family or friends."	4.5
652	Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"The society has agonized about whether computers have made life easier and more convenient for a long time. George's restaurant is a very pleasant place with many tasteful recipes from all around the world to enjoy alone or with your company your dinner.The Head-chef is an experienced and skillful man in his work.The food ,his team of chefs,prepare is always magnificent and the decoration a piece of art ,not to mention that the decoration is fully engaged in the Head-chef .Not only the food but also the restaurant itself is a very beautiful destination . Some people argues that computers have made life easier and more convenient; on the other hand, the other stated that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Between both sides, I agree with the opinion which argues computers are beneficial to human beings for following reasons: providing various contents, supporting complex calculations, and increasing accesibility of informations. Firstly, computer provides various contents to people. It allows people to enjoy online games, stream movies, and chat with other people, regardless with time and place. Nowadays, a lot of people enjoys online games like League of Legends, and watch movie through streaming platform such as Netflix. They can enjoy these contents because of computer, which makes long-distance submission of videos and real-time interaction possible. Secondly, computer supports complex calculations. computers can deal with complex calculations not only accuratively but also quickly. Therefore, it can solve equations that human cannot solve, such as equations for QR decomposition for large matrices. By solving those equations, computers extends the ranges of sciences which human can deal with. As a result, technologies that benefits human beings are invented much faster. Finally, computers highly increases accesibility of various informations. Some people may state that there are plenty of worthless informations in the internet, and people can obtain high-quality informations at libraries, so computers have not contributed to increase accesibility of useful informations. However, through computer, people can access informations without limitations of place and time. Moreover, they can obtain only useful informations by using faithful sites. Therefore, computers highly increases accesibility of various informations, which helps people to get informations that they need. and we must lern children that clean is necessary for their health and on their school they should throw rubbish on Waste basket and who throw it on the ground Will be punished . Therefore, I totaly agree with the opinion which states that computers have made life easier and more convenient."	4.5

Then, I'll talk about the whole computer network. Finally, I'll talk about the advances in technology due to the computer. I think the use of computers in our town are very good for society. There are the major benefits of using a computer. @CAPS3 is the fact you can use microsoft to write up a paper. Sixth grader @PERSON6 says, ""I would rather type than write a paper. Another reason to use a computer is a for research."" @CAPS4 many articles and facts are online about anything you need,"" says @PERSON4.

Those are just some of the major benefits that the kids do on their computer. Now lets talk about something. That is said to be bad but really isnt; social networking. positives ways for playing badminton: you can lose weight , you vision will be good etc   negatives ways for playing badminton: you right arm is more strong than you left arm , sometime,you are sprain your arm . Also, there is facebook which can help us connect on a global stage. ""I can talk with @CAPS2 cousin in @LOCATION2,"" says @CAPS6. Those are the major social networking tools we use to talk to people around the world. One thing that is important about the computer is the advances in technology caused by it. @CAPS3, we have the laptop which is a portable computer we can take anywhere. ""I can use @CAPS2 computer anywhere I like,"" says @PERSON7. Also, the memory card which allows us to save data on a computer and take it to school or work. Eigth grader @CAPS7 says, ""I can take work I didn't finish in school home with the stick."" However we the people have really important part of making it worse.Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh, clean and safe environment to their people.Recycling item can be a good step to start with clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking care by my city.Everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of province government.People is not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere. Those are some of the major advances caused by the computer. That's why I think using the computer is good for us. Adolescent has always been the hardest part throughout anybody's whole life.. turning out in a fleeting glimpse into an adult, perceiving the other side of life,how tough and complicated it is, trying to deal with its different circumstances.. at this point you merely have a brief look at your whole life, many questions spinning in your head, accusing yourself of being a lost cause, wishing if you could turn the clock back,,but it's all no good.. then you find yourself standing ahead clouds of reality, which sucks.. life is stages, this stage of your life is timeless, no way out.. at some point you wish if it was all illusio, you need a time machine makes it possible to go back in time when you could see the purity of life.. However..here you are completely different made of life lessons, preferring to make a stiff upper lip..cowering in your own reality. We talk to people world-wide when ever we want to. The computer has even been the sole purpose for many other ground breaking improvements in technology. @CAPS4 please help defend us kids in this case about computer use."	4.5

"Dear @CAPS1: you recently posed a question in you Newspaper. The @CAPS2 yourk @CAPS3, asking if the readers were for or against technology. I support computers because they give one opportunity to learn about different people all over the world and their culture, they save massive ammounts of time in today's hustle-bustle society, and you can talk to people online via certain computer programs. With a computer one can learn scores of information about foreign countries and their culture. the public transport  have no future , the crisis in 2008 ; has been down the oil prices .The oil is cheap now and new cars are more efficient and the goverment give stimolous for consumers. This man, @PERSON1, was assigned a from the farms of @CAPS6 who had never been out of the fields. @PERSON1 thought @CAPS13 would be nice to welcome her in his house with a familiar setting. Unfortunatley, he knew nothing about @CAPS6. This is due to Lima in the beginning  has not had a pant to desing its public road s and highways, and it only has been improvising to build their way without any criteria to transport its population. When the woman stepped into his door, @CAPS8 was eastastic to feel like @CAPS8 was home again. @CAPS8 ended up staying with @PERSON1 and getting married. If he had not charmed her with his knowledge from the computer. @CAPS8 might not have stayed and had a wonderful life with him. Also, @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION2 says that language students such as spanish and french have @PERCENT1 higher success rate if they have a computer to learn more about the countries. He says the average grade for kids with a computer is an A. but the average grade for kids @CAPS15 a computer is a @CAPS9+. Therefore, having a computer to learn about faraway places and people can ensure happiness and succes in the future. Computer also save a massive ammount of time. In the school Newspaper, @PERSON6 told about her homework problem. ""@CAPS10 night i had @CAPS11 homework. I had vocals @CAPS8 is a galore to deal with. I had to look up @CAPS10 word in the huge dictionary, I was failing @CAPS11 because i just didn't have the time for my homework! Then my family bought me a computer, @CAPS13 was so nice using the online dictionary. I could finish my homework in @NUM1 minutes compared to @NUM2 hours! I was finally doing well in @CAPS11."" @CAPS15 her computer, @PERSON6 would have to have and @CAPS11 @NUM2. @CAPS8 would have just kept failing @CAPS15 her time-saving computer. ALso, @PERSON3 says that @PERCENT2 of people get to work faster when they look up traffic reports on the computer instead of listening in the radio. But today, Things are getting change and technology marked a significant role in our life, Automobile segment increased its vertical and having a car becomes a need from luxory. As you can see, time is a valuable thing which computers can help save. Finally, computer allow one to talk online. I think it would be important that, not only in the family, but also in the school could be grow a new generaion sensible to ecological problems of the earth. The doctor told him that he would not be able to participate in school for a. The student, @PERSON5, came up with a plan to speak to his teachers via his laptop and webcam. Everyday, the teachers would give @PERSON5 an update over his computer. When he finally marched back into school, @PERSON5 barely had any work to make up because his teacher bad interacted with him over the computer. @CAPS15 his computer, @PERSON5 would have a month's worth of work and learning to make up which would have been overwhelming. Also, @PERSON4 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that students that communicate with their families during college have better relationshops after college. Obviously, being able to talk to some are over the computer is a useful thing to have. In conclusion, having a family computer is a very good thing. Not only does @CAPS13 allow people to learn about places other than their home, @CAPS13 also gives us more time and allow us to talk to other withour ever leaving the comfort on home. I recommend that everyone who wants an easier life should invest in a computer."	4.5
655	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Smoking in restaurants is a crime against humanity. It is a travesty, a blemish on the fabric of human society, a glitch in the Matrix. It is an enemy of the human race; like Moby Dick to Ahab, like Voldemort to Harry Potter, like Twilight to literature. It is the reason cavemen killed each other, the reason weapons were invented, the reason Hitler waged war. Convincing me that smoking in restaurants is acceptable on any level at all is like convincing a blind man to buy a 3D HDTV; it simply does not compute. I am not talking about the health risks caused by smoking. Respiratory illnesses, lung cancer, the Black Plague for all I care. It is your lungs breathing the smoke, your money paying for it, and your brain deciding that this somehow makes sense. You, however, are not going to smoke within any reasonable radius of the untainted pink lungs that belong to me. A restaurant is a public place. A smoker loses the right to do what he pleases when his actions infringe upon others and their ability to do what they please. Banning smoking is not a way of infringing on your rights, it is a way of making sure you do not infringe on mine. Forget all that; this is eating we are speaking of! Food is a beautiful mix of sights and smells, a confluence of aromatic explosions. Dining is an experience, and the culinary arts are the pinnacle of human achievement. A good meal is the work of an artist. Any chef worth his weight in salt (or soy sauce, since we are in Hong Kong) will shriek in horror if it is known that the splendid scent of tobacco is going to infuse itself into his work of art. First,the bank notes are designed by consider,thinking from background colour,artwork,security issues.Then,the metal plates are preparated by skilled machinists.And then, the sheets are printed,operator should pay attention to the colour on both sides,special ink,and images slightly raised."	4.5

        Since I came in KAIST, I have thought that KAIST is pretty good college. I satisfy my university sufficiently. If I must choose one thing that I want to change in KAIST, nevertheless, my choice is the region of our college. On the other hand, I think it would be much better that KAIST is in Seoul. this country are many interesting pLaces to visit,if you wantto have adventure you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza.If you want to have fun you may go to parque de la Costa there are many interesting rolercoasters.And if you want to go the best museum of art in Argentina you should go to malba. The first reason is the traffic in Seoul is more comfortable. Before I came in Daejeon, I lived in  Gwang-Myeong which is nearby Seoul. So, I realized the subway of Seoul is the best vehicle that college students can use. However, the subway of Daejeon is too less to move the place I want to arrive. There are just one line in Daejeon. In contrast, there are more than 9 lines in Seoul. Second, there are many places where we can play in Seoul. I think Daejeon is less exciting city than Seoul. When I was in Seoul, I could go to many places such as other universities festival to play. However, I have done same thing like going PC room and drinking alcohol in Daejeon in my case. In addition, I can meet my friends that I met in my secondary school. in Seoul. Finally, it is hard to get along with other college students in Daejeon. In Seoul, there are many universities and they are close enough to meet together. But, KAIST is nearby Chungnam university and we can meet them only. I think the people that we meet are too limited. If KAIST is in Seoul, there are more chances that we can meet other college students. I know it is hard changing the site of KAIST. My studies in tecnologico de Monterrey are demanding and challenging because it has a very high educative score all worldwide, but also has to many good things, for example we have a lot of interchanges all around the world, when you have the opportunity to do an interchange you have to deal with the language and the culture with the other country, that means you have to be responsible for studying the basics things of that country, but all of this is worthwhile because when you are there you have so much fun. I just imagine if KAIST is in Seoul. I think the advantage of traffic and many places which is interesting and so on is the reasons which support my"	4.5
657	Government: Some people think that governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology. Other people disagree and think that this money should be spent on more basic needs. Which of these opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Where governments should spend their money have been controversial among citizens. Although some believe that governments should spend as much money as possible on basic needs, others suggest that governments need to spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology. In my opinion, spending money on computer technology is needed. First of all, computer technology makes productivity increase. If the government makes new systems by computers, productivity can increase by saving time. In addition to the activation of productivity, computer technology makes governments powerful. Today, technology of governments means competitiveness. If they have the technology, you will bring a lot of money to their country by participating in other countries' businesses. My name is Anna,I am a very cheerful person and I have a creative personality so I enjoy planning activities or organise sport events in a special and  colorful way.I really love childrens and take care of them ,I also had an experience  of working in summer camps and have a good experience doing delicious food because I already did this stuff in other camps.I think that I gave good reasons and I hope that you will accept me. However, the computer actually increases people who have jobs. The development of computer technology activates the economy. As governments focus on computer technology, many companies will participate in developing computer technology. Developments of computer technology not only make a lot of profits but also increase employees, which leads to the activation of the economy. To sum up, focusing on computer technology should be mandatory."	4.5

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 life without computers. There would be no quick access to information, no way to socialize, and no way to keep your health records or other personal information safe. Without this technology where would we be? I believe that the world is benefiting from the advances in technology today. As a student, computers are a crucial element to allow me to get my work done. without the guidance from @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7, @CAPS4 @CAPS5, or other applications, @CAPS6 woudn't be possible for me to reach my full potential a assignments. How could a student be so certain their grammar is perfect on their homework without asking a teacher? There is a way. It is called @ORGANIZATION2 tools. However, the only way to access this is through a computer or @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7 @ORGANIZATION2 tools allows you to check your spelling, grammar, and punctuation with just a click of your mouse. Computers are an essential learning tool for school system today. Not only are computers used to educate, but they are helpful in the real world. Many business rely on the work of Computers entirely. In facts, @CAPS8 to @PERSON1 @CAPS9 @ORGANIZATION1, a local business ""@LOCATION1,"" In our job, we continuously we work with. this wouldn't be possible without the effort of our typist on the computer. ""@CAPS6 business and companies around the nation are relying on the advances in technology, why change anything? We should continue to progress in this groth @PERCENT1 of business in @LOCATION1 say they would have to close dawn @CAPS6 not for computers with so many business doing this, our economy would drop. Other reason for my opinión is that almost all the people preffer use the visual sense and ear to other person more than write and listen for understand new things. We all know computers and other technology are great sources of entertainments. What you @MONTH1 not now, however, is that they supply a great amount of knowledge to the average person. For example, lets say you finished watching a special on the discovery channel about @LOCATION2. You want to know more, so you pull out your iPod touch. All you have to do is log on to the internet and search ""@CAPS11 of @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2"" @CAPS12 seconds, you would have your information. People @MONTH1 not believe so, but it is true that you canlearn a great deal of information from various forms of technology. You can have all the resources you'll ever reed right at your fingertips. Computer supply so much more then just entertainment.

"Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 you know that over half our nation own home computers? Recently, though, some experts have been concerned whether or not computers benefit society. I have been asked to state my opinion and I believe computers have a positive effect becuase, they are mandatory for work, allow online socialization, and expand traveling. After reading this, I am sure you will agree. Firstly, computers are mandatory to have for work and @ORGANIZATION1. Students keep their essays, study guides, and home work updates on files in the @CAPS5. Offices would not be able to function @CAPS8 computers; workers rely on the internet email system. An interviews with a student from @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""I use my @CAPS5 for everything; I would not survive the workload @CAPS8 @CAPS3."" @CAPS2 asked why, he replied, ""@CAPS3 keeps everything organized, and is an easier way to research topics."" A lawyer said, ""You can not support a client if you don't have the right tools, and a @CAPS5 is on @MONEY1 those tools."" Already public transport have been improvement and that makes comfortable to go on a trip,but I think that will be able to become good quality more and more,because so many people expectation. Could you imagine writing a newspaper @CAPS8 a @CAPS5? Secondly internet access allows people to meet new people. Many websites such as '@CAPS6' and '@CAPS7' allow people to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. The people of my town try to plant plants in the centre or somewhere is too smoke, so they try to keep the air at recommended levels.on the morning a lot of people go on footto the work or to the school or ride a bike or they take the bus.The people try to move the local factories out of country where is less air polluted ,less smoke,less cars and more forests and plants. A psychologist explains, ""Some people are too shy to meet new friends in person; online bloom."" @CAPS8 internet, citizens @MONEY1 @LOCATION1 would know little about other countries' people. My next reason, however is even greater. Lastly, @CAPS8 internet, people would do for less traveling. Internet allows citizens to research places they would like to visit and buy transportation to their destination. @CAPS3 also is an easy and effective way @MONEY1 booking where the tourist shall stay. Apoll taken by @ORGANIZATION2 airports shows that @PERCENT3 @MONEY1 the travelers book their flights online and @CAPS8 online ticketing 'the wait to book your flights would be unbearabley long; or stop travelers completely' (quote from a worker). Some people guess the nuclear power has a great value to produce power instead of the fossil fuels such as : coals and oil which are Not renewable energy.Moreover, they think that controlling the pollution is possible. We inquired about how the bought their tickets and @PERCENT4 @MONEY1 them said online. ""@CAPS9 do you mean, how? On the internet @MONEY1 course! no one could get anywhere if we stood in lines all day!"" said a person interviewed. Airports make @MONEY1 for the @LOCATION2 government, and @CAPS8 internet less people would travel. There for, computers are mandatory. Computers have a positive effect on owners; since they allow easy organization and research, online socializing and better ways @MONEY1 booking transportation. @CAPS8 computers internet access, our business would crumble, then the economy would follow. I know you agree with me."	4.5

"Dear editor, I think that people are spending too much time on the computer. Because of this, people are getting less exersice, they are not spending enough time outdoors and the dont spend as much time with their family and friends. Exersicing is an important part of one's daily schedued. I have a friend who exersices everyday. She is the healthiest person I know and rarely spends anytime on the computer. But, she knows someone who is almost her compleate oposite. He hardly ever exersices and spends @NUM1 hours on the computer each day. He has also been diagnosed with diabeties and is obese. These are the type of health problems that are faced because of lack of exersice and too much computer time. Experts say that people should get at least @NUM2 minutes of exersice every day. But, because more and more people are spending time on computers, this is almost impossible. Studies done at @ORGANIZATION1 show that @PERCENT1 of kids under the age of @NUM3 are obese or at the risk of becaming obese because they are not getting enough exersice. You don't want that number to increase do you? There are other problems that people face because of too much time on the computer. People are spending less time outdoors and more time inside at a desk. My friend @PERSON1 spends way too much time on her computer and not enough outside. She failed a science poject because she was on her computer, rathern than outside comparing the leaves from different trees. Doctor @PERSON2 is a child phycologist and when he asked kids if they would rather play outside or be on a computer, @PERCENT2 of them said computer. This shows that people on computers are not only young, but they want to be on the computer more than be outside. This is a number that, in my opinion, is too high. Lastly, there is the problem of people not spending enough time with their family and friends. By this I mean face to face time, not just video chatting with your friends on facebook. This has caused tension in relationships. My friend @PERSON3 didn't go to her family reunion but stayed at home on the computer and at the next family get together, she was ostrisized because she didn't go to the reunion. In addition, my major is English so teachers will teach and explain by English, which I can’t catch up on lessons well in the first time. These are all god reasons why less time on the computer and more time exersicing, outside, and with family and friends will make your life happier and healthier."	4.5

"Dear @CAPS1 Society: Computers are perhaps one of the greatest improvements to our societies advancement in knowledge in the past few decades. These gems of future, are like a human being; they have their own mind and can figure out answers to all problems. People all around the world use them, from @LOCATION5 to @LOCATION4, to @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1, they are being used. People from ages of school kids, to adults who have a job so highly appreciated as a chemist, use computers! Do you wish to be that one standing on the side lines, stuck in the past, not advancing with technology? From the creations of rockets, engines and planes; computers have never let us down. Still, the question is this: will computerized technology benefit our society or crash it down? Ever since the @DATE1, computers have been used as an ad for new information. The speed that they are able to recieve new information in is just astonishing! @CAPS2 @PERSON2, computer engenieer, says ""With the technology that we recieve from computers, we are able to be in the game."" @CAPS2 just comes to show one of the best benefits of computers: their ability to display the most current information. Now, I can see how books are an excellent resource in society, and how they provide for amazing information, however it takes years to publish books! With the use of a computer, information that occured sometimes as close to @NUM1 hours ago can appear on the internet! Not only will this allow you to get information faster, but it will allow our society to ""be in the game."" You catch a football as it soars through the air, you track a baseball or it flys high in the sky, you grasp the face of a basketball all because you have ""hand-eye"" coordination. Hand-eye coordination is perhaps one of the most neccessarry aspects of life that a person can have. Face it, everybody needs it! So why not help your body to get that talent: buy a computer. Imagine, our society would advance in it's sports and even just with life if they learn how to coordinate themselves. Did you know that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people who owned a computer and typed daily were able to catch all three tennis-balls that were thrown at them! You could do that too! When typing on a computer, human development observers states, your eyes a free tracked on the screen and you train your hands to manuvor about the keys all by themselves. However, I think the tools should be improved, such as killer’s knife and actors'costumes, the knife looks like as brittle as a handicraft, I believe those are seconded-handed clothing. I can remember when I started typing, my hands began to naturally find the keys without me having to look at them. And the next day at basketball practice I felt like @CAPS3 amazing point-guard @PERSON1, the ball just came straight to my hand! Get this need of life, invest in a computer! Money @MONTH1 be the most vital thing in our society right now. With profits as low as medium wage, our local area is not that ""rich."" I can see how it could be hard, having to purchase these computers at prices as high as @MONEY1 each. Most of the labours will probably have been represented by machinery, the people who is lack of academic might be very hard to get a job, the knowledge might be demand if the people live in the future. Not only do computer's stand to last @NUM5 longer than any paperback, their information is always new, changing, and up-to-date. In order for us to be purchasing new books because of recent information would end up coasting as more in the long-run. Our neighboring society of @LOCATION3 just invested in over @NUM6 comptuers for their society. We the management of The Arch London Hotel received your mail and wishes to let you know that you should make known to us the position you desired to work in via return mail along with a scan copy of your signed contract of agreement to enable us make every necessary corrections.Thank you. Now just imagine how much money our society would gain after @NUM8 year! It is necessary for our society to have computers. With them we not only learn hand-eye coordination but we invest in more money for the. And now with so many things happening in the world it is important to recieve information instantely from these computers. when I find me in London, I'm going to the buckingham palace located in the city of westminster and I'll see your art gallery and tourist attraction of the British monarchy continue in London, I will visit to the largest parks in London, the hyde park that having a full day of guided outdoor games and activities for perservation thereof park follow in London I'll go for a walk to arrive at the big ben that is the most beautiful bullding in all its splendour when I will take pictures later, I'll take the underground of London that is a public fast transit system, I'm trawiling in it when I'll leave of the underground in the station wembley park I going to the wembley stadium where I will enjoy an evening of football, the match started at 8:00pm Dreams of incrediable rockets and medicines and cures far diseases just won't happen.

"As computer technology is the heart of high technology, computer technology is the foundation of national development. Despite the claim, some people think governments should spend money on more basic needs. In my opinion, governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology. First of all, almost high technologies are based on computer technology. To develop high technologies that determine the future of the nation, developing computer technology is necessary. By developing computer technology, the nation can go ahead of other counties. In addition to developing high technologies, computer technology can give opportunities to lower-income groups. There is a man who is most important for one's life.I am not different from that.there is a back stairs influence    in my life he is none but my father.I respect him so much and admire also.He is my best friend who never hurts me.He always helps me by giving good advance.He is an ideal farmer who never and even tells a lie.His means of livelihood is the simplest.He always honors the oldest and taught us of avoiding tells a lie.so far as I remember one day he was advising me suddenly a old man entered the conversation and told a foolish speech. If governments support computers, then lower-income groups can have opportunities to use high technology. Finally, some people believe that computer technology removes many jobs, computer technology creates various businesses and jobs. For example, most of the largest companies are based on computer technology and they provide really many jobs. Also, many businesses are created by computer technology. To sum up, developing or buying computer technology develops high technology, gives opportunities to lower-income groups, and creates various businesses and jobs.

"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 a teanger growing up in this technologic era @MONEY1 society, I think computers are more harmful than helpful. I presume that books are better resources, people can find fun in other ways and that computers can be dangerous and cause health problems. @CAPS1 a well-read newspaper, your stand on this subject will influence the minds @MONEY1 many. I know computers can help find information, but personally, I believe that books are better resources. Anyone can write and post an article on the internet, even if what they are saying is not true at all. All this will help people to live easily, but only to have more time to work, because the type of mind that reign that time will focus in the companies and make money and spend it, this is the reason why a lot of jobs are changing to a home office and the firms are giving more and more facilities to their employees to be more efficient. On the computer, you can never be sure who to believe, but with books you know what you're reading is accurate. The information on the computer, (that's true) you can find a book. Sure, the computer @MONTH1 be the quicker or ""easy way @CAPS6 "" in some cases, but maybe what people need is a challenge. It seems that because @MONEY1 the growing technology, every generation gets lazier and lazier, and less and less into books and it's time for that to stop. Also, people can find fun in many other ways not involving a computer. Many people use social networking sites to connect with their friends, such @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, but on those, you can't tell if that person is really who they say they are or not. If you want to talk to your friends, why not call them or more modernly, text them? That way you can be sure @MONEY1 who you are talking to. and we must lern children that clean is necessary for their health and on their school they should throw rubbish on Waste basket and who throw it on the ground Will be punished . What happend to playing cards and board games with your family? It's much more enjoyable, in my opinion if you play the game for real and not virtually. You can also go outside and get some fresh air, instead @MONEY1 that muggy smell in your room because you're so busy on the computer, you forgot to @CAPS5 the laundry. Plus, if kids have to start handwriting their papers that would improve their handwriting, because they wouldn't get the simplicity @MONEY1 typing. Besides, some kids don't have access to computers, anyways and you have to handwrite your @ORGANIZATION2's, so why not? The sport is very importatnt of our body it has many benefits to emprove our selves and give us self confedant so we should practice any sport we love because it can change our mind to the better. The use @MONEY1 social networks allows kids to put all their information @CAPS6 there, for anyone to see. This can lead to bad things, like being stalked or kidnapped. The internet also carries many innapropriate images and websites, that youngsters, or anybody, really, should be looking at also staring at a computer screen for hours on end is very bad for your eyes and can cause very serious vision problems in the long run. Plus, I'm sure you've heard how many typists are more prone to arthritis or any problems with pain or loss @MONEY1 the use @MONEY1 their fingers because @MONEY1 the movement @MONEY1 your fingers when you are typing.

Don't let the media fool you or pull you in with their tricks, scams, or gimmicks to get you buy one, and next time you go to turn on your computers, thinks "" @CAPS5 I really need this or is there a better way to achieve what I need to get done or what I want to @CAPS5?"" because, more than likely there will be a better way.

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"I will tell you a review of a thriller, the thriller is Hunger games it is about some capitals and people are choised and play on a game, you have to kill persons for they don't kill you, is a movie that have suspense because you want to know ho survey, in the movie someone love someone and protect each others, is very cute but on the 3 movies they are bad moments with the family, capitals, Friends, etc. Dont you think?, I do. And here's how @CAPS1 gonna convince you. One day I visit my friend Jimmy in New York city, he was a young man who was specialist on trains and tourism, he talked about how the citizens and the commuters move from one place to another, he told me that the grand central terminal was the largest terminal of the city,he show me were the landmarks of the big apple were so sightseers could go,he show me the city and we went to different parts first he took me to Columbus circle in the south west corner of central park were there were the most expensive apartments then we went to the lake were the jogging tracks that circle the lake area popular with early morning visitors,then we went to the museum of natural history that was located near the metropolitan museum of art then I got focal on the subway trains so we went to Grand central terminal when we arrive I was amazed to see many people going to work so he told me that it was conveniently for people to use the train because is very fastest and for the government it was a grat economic business then he told me that one of the characteristics of Positive effects that computers have on peole is that, it teaches hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and even allow people to talk online with other people. These great qualities computers have for people are fantastic. Also the fact that computers just keep upgrading as time goes by. So, by you reading this introduction, I hope you are satisfied with what I am going to in order to show you that computers are positive devices and can be helpful to everyone. Firstly, as I started in my introduction paragraph, computers help teach people hand-eye coordinates. This i believe is a good thing to know because without it, there arent many things you could do. For example fly a plane. You wouldn't be able to do that without both hand and eye coordinates because you would have to manually move the plane, and check to see if everythings in order by multi-tasking. Furthermore, this is just one given reason on why computers are positive towards everyone's benefit. Secondly, computers give people the ability tolearn about faraway places and people. This is also good for people's benefits because, theres knowledge in every bit of it. Your learning about others cultures, heritage, family history, and so forth and so on. This could also help you in the long run with any job you want to do because knowledge can get you anywere. It can get you very far in life so learn as much as you can, and I beleive computers can do so. This is another reason why computers can be positive. As for the last reason, I say that peolple can also talk to other people online on the computer.This is also beneficial because again, like I stated in my @NUM1 paragraph, you can learn many things that way and meet new people. Now dont you think computers can benefit anyone! I do and will always have the same opinion that is positive towards computers. For my conclusion, I would like to say that I hoped you enjoyed every bit of what I had to say, and you can also agree with the positive affects computers have on people. I truly beleive that computers are beneficial to all people and should continue to be around. it benefits society, and I enjoy every bit of using it. Thank you."	4.5

"Dear local newspaper, I feel that computers are very useful to society. For example, millions of people and companies and small buisnesses require the use of computers in order to optimally run their buisness. Everyone who uses computers on a daily basis can confirm that they are very useful. In fact, computers are so useful, some schools are starting to notice. I hightly reccomend that you get aquanted with such a useful and very recognized plece of technology. Did you know that many billion-dollar companies and small buisnesses require the uses that a computer has to offer? For example, my mother is s former-district manager of the fast-food company, @ORGANIZATION1. When she worked at the company, they gave her a laptop that she could use only for her work. This proves my point that companies and small buisnesses require the features of a computer to smoothly run the buisness of which they run or one employed at. The technology of computers has brought education to new. For some reasons, I really liked to play basketball, first, playing basketball can train my muscle and make the body more healthier ; the second, my classmates and I all know how to win a game through the basketball game because the basketball game is a teamwork. Classes have even been created in schools because of the popularity of computers. For example, at my school, a computer education (or, comp, for short) class has been created for kids to understand the knowledge and skills using a computer can give to them in the real-world. In my opinion, I it is great that computers are incorporated in so many places. Computers are used by millions of people every day. Such buisnesses are corporate like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 are starting to see the brilliance in using computers in their company. In fact, computers are so useful and helpful, teachers have taken up using computers in their classrooms. I hope it is not just me that sees the good that a computers brings, but anyone else that @MONTH1 have taken a glare at this letter."	4.5

Teachers are telling us this, while parents and grandparents are telling us how mush different their world used to be. They explain how the media of their time wasn't as open about sex and violence. They go on to say how they didn't have violent video games teaching children that killing is alright. Because of these people, we think that the media is repsonsible for the wrong in the world of @DATE1. The truth is that it isn't the medias fault, it is the parents. It is the parents responsiblity to teach the children of the world the difference between right and wrong. If these such parent do their jobs correctly then the youth of @DATE1 will not need for everything to be censored. It is my firm belief that their should not be any censorships. When their is censorship people can govern what we learn, destroy what goes agiainst their beliefs, and destroy our god given right to freedom of speech    Censorship will detroy the knowlege available @DATE1. We have had seen censorship in our history. When we look back we see that the @ORGANIZATION1's censored and destroyed anything that went against them. We hated it when they had book burnings and destroyed the custums, art, and music that the government felt was wrong for their people. How would we be any different if we did it. We could potentailly be destroying somones way of life. We would be destroying what could possibly be tomorrows masterpeice. In censoring we would be detroying history.By destroying history we would be detroying the brilliance that is learning. If we allow censorship anything that goes against our own personal beliefs would be destroyed. If you ask any christian if they would allow their children to read the muslim book of faith, the @LOCATION1, they would tell you no. It would be the same if you asked a muslim if they would let their children read the @CAPS1. The point is that if their is cansorship we would be destroying other peoples beliefs. No one has the right to govern what others believe in the world. Also in censorship we would be exterminating our freedom of speech and the freedom to express ourselves. If we don't allow peole to read what someone else has written because we believe it is wrong, then we are taking away their ability to learn new ideas because everyone has different opinionsand theories. Every newspaper would shut down because they would all be saying the same thing. No one would want to read them because they would already know what they would hav eto say. Nowadays in the cities developed there are many possibilities for public transport, like bus, train, subway, tram etc.these options it's more economical than the car, the problem of the car is that normally the car is occupied for a person, when the car is prepared for to carry four or five people. Of course their will always be things in the media, in books, and in music that we don't like.Their will be cursing, nudity, and violence everywhere we turn. This is not because we want it there, but because these things are a part of life. They are the dark parts that we dont want to see. If you dont want to see dont look. Just dont close everyone elses eyes because you dont like what you see. Our learning, our beliefs, and our freedom of speech are too important to just give up to censorship. We cannot alow others to dictate, in this matter, what is right for us. Our media is too intertwined with our lives. When you have skill to read a book and in that  moment you are searching for good job you can find  a lot  jobs because you can develop easy when you compare with another person that they have been searched  job to i know that i am not professional player and i am n't belong to any team  but i like this game .basketball is so simple play but it is need Speed ,concentration and The ability to determine the distances  , it  contains of two team of five player and each team try to get a high point by throwing the ball through the basket.

Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. "	"Whether to hire an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or to hire an experienced worker at a higher salary is a significant debate to employers throughout various fields. Some argue that hiring an inexperienced worker is more helpful, however, I believe hiring experienced worker is the better choice. The most essential reason that hiring an experienced worker is better is the ability to handle troubles. The experienced workers have their strengths in overcoming various crisis. Also, they hardly make mistakes as well. I have to start saying that I never imagine swimming like my favorite sport, because until my back´s injury, I practiced other sports, I most like extreme sports like downhill, skateboarding martial arts like Aikido, jiujitsu or ninjutsu, but for my injury I have to start swimming and now I love it. In addition to the trouble-handling ability, the scarcity of experienced worker is another reason. The higher salary is inevitable cost to hire the experieced ones, due to the law of supply and demand. The absolute number of the experienced workers is limited, which results in higher salary in this case. This tells us that the experienced workers are more preferred in most sitations . Nevertheless, some insist that hiring inexperienced worker at a lower salary is more efficient to those having an hardtimes in budget. However, in most cases, experienced workers show higher effeciency than inexperienced workers. For example, a baseball club prefer a starplayer than a rookie player, eventhough owning a starplayer requires more cost. It is because there is another disguised limitation, the population. The employer should hire the most essential and efficient employee under limited budget and population. Thus, hiring the experienced workers will be the best solution to those hesitating to make decisions."	4.5
668	Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. 	"Nowadays, many people contend with each other about whether computers have made life more convenient or just stressful. Because you are the best teacher in the whole world!many of our class classmate really like you too!We know that you are going to teach  Discovery-bay  primary school .My English result is  better once  you taught me I really love you, Ms Cumings!your friend Ms Decock told me that  she is going to Australia ,and I love you two both I hope you that you will come back some times ! To begin with, computers help people by connecting all people to ubiquitous network. I think that computer is the first device for ubiquitous network, and it means that people not only can get various information such as a weather forecast immediately but also break the boundary between people in different places and time. People are connected with each other by the computer network; therefore, there is huge convenience for people who live in the modern society and the revolution of information because they can work together whenever they are, and wherever they are. For instance, people can do their work or study in the colleges because of the development of computers and ubiquitous network system, even in the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows that the value of information from computers is much higher than the stress caused by computers. On top of that, people can alter their labor by computers and increase their work efficiency. Of course, some people can claim that computers will alter all humans because people do not have advantages in the workplace, and this is why people feel streesful on computers; nonetheless, I believe that people have to give their simple work to computers. It is well-known that computers are not good at some regions such as analyzing images, creating a new idea or emotional work. Not only these regions but also many parts of human work need people's creative brains, not just mathematical calculations. If people use computers only in hard work that cannot be done by people or takes too long time to finish, computers can help people and people can live more easier with their own jobs. This occurs in various parts such as the design, the research, and even the work at the factory now and almost people in that workplaces tend to recognize the need of computers. To sum up, computers can provide ubiquitous network so people can work together whenever and wherever they are, and people can give some of their simple work to computers to increase the work efficiency. In this regard, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient. I think that there is no reason not to use computers if there are advantages from computers in appropriate parts."	4.5

I want to turn to his hobbies, when he isn't working, he is riding on a bike, every evening he takes the bike and rides across some paths for more than forty kilometers by day, so he is very good rider and its quite strong to ride with him. It supplies everyday people with information that they are seeking to learn about. There are so many different forms of information and entertainment offered inside libraries. Books, music, movies, etc, they all can be found there. That means he is a careless, who always drives too fast  But public transport has advantages: If we uses it is the essential transport to travel. Genres were created for a reason. Certain items have different forms to them. There are many forms of music. Classical, rock, and blues are some examples. Since music is categorized in such a way, there should  be no need for them not to be on the shelves at a library. If a certain type of music or book is known to be offensive, then that certain genre can be avoided. There is no need to even visit a section of the library if one knows that he or she finds it offensive. In the @CAPS1 the @CAPS2 people are given many rights that are often taken for granted. The freedom of speech is one. It is a privilege that if taken away would tear @CAPS3 a part. The freedom to say what you please also includes singing. Certain music that is on the shelves at a library does have the right to be there. Just because a certain group of individuals finds the type of music offensive, does not mean everyone also thinks that way. For this reason any genre of music can sit on the shelves at a library. Another freedom given to the @CAPS2 people is the freedom of press. Anything put onto paper is legal. Criticizing the government or fantasising about school, it is all legal. Books can be offensive to many people. They can persuade one in ways that is unbelievable. Like music, books have many categories. Whatever is put inside those books is allowed to be there no matter what. Movies are located at libraries as well. They are categorized just as much as books and music. The term ' @CAPS5 judge a book by it's cover' is true sometimes. This can also be used with movies. The title of a moive or book will tell what it is about. Certain movies that are not meant to be seen by children are rated @CAPS6 or @NUM1. Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately.He had to buy a present for his girlfriend´s birthday but it was Sunday and all stores were closed so he had to found a solution.A few hours,he was walking by a garden,and suddenly,he saw the most beautiful flowers that he has ever seen,so he picked them up.However,flowers weren´t enough so he decided to think in anything else.Several hours later,he found an open sweet shop and he bought some bonbons for her.Finally,he had found the present and before the end of the day he ran quickly to his girlfriend's house.If you don't want to pass this situation,you must always do things with time. It is not illegal for a library to have a rated @CAPS6 movie. It is illegal however to check one out to a child of a young age. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. With a great effort sate down on the grass, he feels tired, and has a little sensation of pain in his boson, site there with many sounds on air, he star recall...his face is changing is dark, he has now a clear image of all, when opened the door of the house his girlfriend is there dying on the floor, Michael remember all, the fight, the lays, the screams, the knife...the blood; but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. From books to videogames there are ratings and generes. If someone is offended by these types of entertainment they should not visit that section of the library.

"Knowledge @CAPS1     @CAPS2 you ever remove something that be misconstrued as offensive to someone, although you don't believe it is? Neither @CAPS2 I, and I dont believe libraries should either. Removing books, movies, magazines, and music from libraries is unconstitutional, and it seems to lean toward controling how people think, known as communism. Also anything can be found offensive by one party of people, and so everything @CAPS2 be offensive, and removed. Then libraries @CAPS2 cease to exist. At the end, the kind of live that we will see in fifty years from now will have a lot of stuff to help the people to have a more comfortable, easier and faster way of live, but this will be only to meke more money and consume more and more, also the things will be faster of waste to make the people to change their apparel more often and create a consumerism. If one side of the story is not told, how will the jury be able to tell if the accused is guilty or innocent? my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long. Do you want the government controling what you think? I didn't think so. In the @LOCATION1, modern day @LOCATION2, @PERSON1 did just that. He decided exactaly what went in and out of peoples minds. He did this by desiding what they could read, write, and listen to. That sounds like things you can get at the library, right? We can't have the government controling what we think, and mostly all libraries are government run. If we let them deside what we read and listen to, thats the first step in losing our freedom, and nobody wants to lose their freedom. Lets say a white man goes into a library and looks at a book about racism, and how it has helped the nation. Then, at the same time, an @CAPS3 @CAPS4 women goes into the same library and gets a book on why women are better than men. Then they see each other, and the woman wants the mans book banned, and the man wants the womans book banned, and both the books are removed. Then neither party is happy, because both of their books are gone. The point is, anything can be found offensive, if you just glance at it, or look at it to much. Plus if everything can be found offensive, and all of the offencive materials get removed, then all the books and learning materials are gone. Noone is left happy. If you are being tried for murdering someone, and the lawyer of the defendent gets to say their piece to makes it look like you are a murderer, and you don't get to defend yourself, what are you going to do? Your going to go to jail, most likly an innocent person, and your marked as a murderer the rest of your life, all because your side of the story wasn't heard. That is unjust, unfair, and unconstitutional. If we let this happen to our libraries, half the books will be sentinced to 'death,' without a 'fair trial.' So, if you want to have an un-@CAPS4, communist, and unfair library system, that is your choice, but I believe that the way we do things now is just fine. No book should be banned because of its material, because noone, except the writer knows exactally what it means. People get to read what they want to read, and don't have to read what they don't want to read. To begin with,the format of the bank notes needs to be designed,factors of considerations including the background colour,the artwork and the security issues.Sencondly,equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps.Thirdly,print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink,where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes.

671	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Smoking. Causing a lot of problems presently to students and adults. I bet our country is one of the places where people smoke the most. Honestly, I don't care whether they smoke or not. it's for this reason that I think the public transport is a great benefit for the society, and a good way for move us of the one place at other,  I suggest that  the government  has to give more means for the purpose of improving the public transport. That's totally wrong. They're destroying their bodies completely before they even fully become an adult. They probably smoke because they think it makes them look cool. If the public transport will be by higher quality, faster and fewer rates, majority of citizens will be prefer: is more calm to relax and read a newpaper or a magazine during the way in a collective transport than an indiivdual one; moreover, the time spend up to go and came back will be reduced, because it promotes less car in the railway. It does make certain someone who's smoking look cool. But does looking cool to other people are more worth than their own health? Lots of people regret when they get cancer or they make a hole through their neck. Before then, they can never realize how serious this is. Since smoking started to look cool, it's giving a really bad influence to little kids. The kindergarten children. I mean I saw them smoking not outside but on internet. Spitting saliva out of their mouth. That's not what kids should do. If the government wanted people to make them stop smoking, why didn't they raise the price of the cigarette up to hundred dollars? Who would dare to buy that? That would really help stop smoking. But then again cigarettes bring a lot of profit to our land. It cigarettes become illegal to sell, out country will get a big damage in the financial fees. I guess we can't make those people who smoke stop smoking.

"There is a type of boundary that @MONTH1 restrict readers from gathering knowledge about certain things in books. This is called censorship. However @CAPS3 you @MONTH1 not have known is that it is thought about in every school and every public library. @CAPS3 would you do if you saw your child reading a book that contained frightening descriptions that are to horrrific or to adult like for their own good? This is the question that plauges them every year with new shipments of books. Although yes that seems terrifying it is not right to take books off the shelf for a few reasons;  The congressional law allowing us to have freedom of press, freedom of thought, and the fact children must take in  all the knowledge they can to be the best they can achieve. First of the arguements that can be held is the freedom of press. This law was enacted in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 and is still in effect today. If an individual wanted to write a book that was not for children then he or she @MONTH1 do so without penalizations. Children @MONTH1 read it yes, but that shouldn't be blamed on the author. So they make a plan to display all... The next day when they were about to start filming they ere non ants there so they search for them, but they can't find them... In that moment the ants and Penny attack them in their backs, making them to leave the place. It's hard to get upset with your children for learning something wrong, but it's not right to blame the writer. When it comes to the arugements of @CAPS3 to do on censorship the freedom of thought pops into most minds. This is another law that says citizens are allowed to think @CAPS3 they will of anything. Just as the freedom of press an indiviudal can pick up that book for adults and read it. I think my town really take care of the environment,because there are a lot of parkｓ in this town and these are very clean.However　some people are not care of environment　that mean some people throw garbage away in the park.I think almost everyone loves parks because a lot of people go to the park and having　lunch,picnic,excersise,nap etc.I think after eat something at the park then clean themselves is good. If they are discouraged by it then by all means let them put it down, however, if they enjoy the read and the more unique wording than in childrens novels let them continue learning. Suddenly,a rube boy grabbed the little boy 's clothes,the little boy was cried loudly,my brother was outrege,ran to the rube boy and attached  him. This is not scientificly proven but when you are around children constantly you notice this. Just as a babies mind is a sponge it still continues to gather all of the information it possibly can during its pre-teen years. When they are allowed to read any book and not sit infront of a television screen all day they learn more. Now someone can come along and say:  '@CAPS3 if the book is a fantasy?'. It's no different. The storyline is not @CAPS3 teaches them, it is the words and how they are used that is knowledge. An educated man can sometimes get tounge-tied with words where as if someone who did not do well in school or college read quite a bit they are able to use words with great ease. It is not allways the case, but wouldn't you like your own child to sound intelligent while speaking during important events? All in all it seems to be a great waste when censoring books for the public. There can be great things in those books that not everybody can reap. Pulling them off the shelf could mean that you impede someones ability to learn a new word or gramatical law. If one parent could pull a book off a shelf then another could do it and soon you would not have any books. It would be a scary day if that happened. For it would not be something that went well in our history. Since humankind has had writing we became more intelligent, taking books off all of the shelves would revert us to primitive beings. So keep the books on the shelves even if children should not read them.

673	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"I disagree with the statement. An day in the morning Paxton waited to Long y the writer, but he listened that called him suddenly he goes for the beach and is killed for the shadow There are even fines if one smokes at bus stops or in other non-smoking areas. Smoking in restaurants can affect many diners, especially if the smoke ""interferes' with their consumption of food. I do agree that it can be uncomfortable for diners and perhaps even irritating. However, I argue that to completely ban smoking in all restaurants is unfair to smokers. There should be a smoking corner or a smoking room instead, which can greatly help smokers take a break and relax in between their meal times. This will definitely be more appreciated than to ban smoking in restaurants entirely. It also infringes on their right and freedom to smoke, which is ironical, especially in a country that promotes freedom and equality. Should the government want to completely ban smoking in a particular area, then why do they even allow the sale of cigarettes in the first place? It is this irony that exists in public places that create confusion and conflict among people, and smokers in particular."	4.5

"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a student of the local middle school technology is utilized to the fullest. Computers have helped us write essays more efficiently & complete research assignments. However, personally I feel that this constant usage of computers has a negative impact on people. Firstly, computers hinder interpersonal connections. @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION1 help keep in touch with old college buddies', but no computer can replace face-to-face communication. From hard, cold text, one cannot decipher subtle connotations or wit. Bot, people are beginning to replace seeing one another with @CAPS3 networking. With the technological revolution came games like @ORGANIZATION2. These games are addicting, @CAPS4, our society mocks ""nerds"" for spending too much time playing these trivial games, but it really is a serious issue. For example, in a recent study done by @ORGANIZATION3 students, ""@NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers who play computer games do not get the recommended amount of daily exercise."" This is because these games are so absorbing. The amount of time put into gaming. Ultimately consumes all free time. Nowadays we use technology in every thing, from educations to making clothes, we use technology everyday and everywhere.Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful,useful and  important for development but todays generation is influenced whit technology that they have stopped to do other activities. @CAPS2 a people, we are quickly learning that what was once so genius, is actually dangerous. If one was to stare at a backlit screen for hours on and, their eyesight would definitely start to deteriorate. Loss of eyesight is just one of the negative impacts computers have in our health. @CAPS2 aforementioned, obesity is issue. Now, couple this with bad eyesight, @CAPS5 @CAPS6 deficiency & a negative outlook & you've got yourself a issue. All of the deseases brought on by computers can be just by less time on the computer, & exercises. Naturally, @CAPS2 a specie we were not to spend so much time in a fixed position. This static state is a new phenomena that is aquiring major health problems. The over usage of computers practionally, robs us of our time, destroys our health, & hinders our @CAPS3 interactions. This makes computers a negative influence on people & their health."	4.5
675	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"There are denying that the environment are changed by behavior of people and animals.For instance, people need to many places to build the modern society,so they fall down lots of trees,burnning many glasses.Another factor that the animals are not control themmselves to eat the plaints lend to distriction of ecosystem . A part time job, foremost, can provide students with a source of income. This will reduce some of the financial burden that their educational fees and other miscellaneous spending place on their families. Working for their own income (or a portion thereof) also nurtures in them a responsibility for managing their personal spending and earning patterns. It is likely that experiencing the effort required to generate income will incentivise frugality and wiser spending decisions. Furthermore, part-time jobs allow students to hone new or existing skills. A tutoring job, for example, not only allows the student to keep his/her mind active and constantly practise the subject, but also forces him/her to acquire a whole new trove of skills relating to teaching. An administrative job can prepare the student for administrative work --- which exists in most regular jobs --- required in future, as well as allow him/her to exercise organisational skills. On the other hand, a part-time job may detract a student's attention from his/her studies. A significant amount of time and effort inevitably has to be dedicated to the job, and this comes at the opportunity cost of revision and other school work. Should the student not be able to cope with both simultaneously, it would definitely be better for him/her to focus on studies and perhaps take up temporary job opportunities during the holidays instead. Therefore, I feel that a part-time job can be an important part in a college student's development, but need not necessarily be a priority."	4.5

"Computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can help people learn about news in the world, places and people. Computers can also help people communicate with each other. Computers can also teach hand-eye cordination. People who support advances in technology, believe computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers people could not learn new things. On a computer you can learn about new places. People could see where something is, locate it, or learn about the place. I remember when I was working on a project about @LOCATION2. I had no clue what to do on the topic, so I whent on the computer and looked up @LOCATION2. It told me @LOCATION2 was located in @LOCATION1. Then it showed me a picture of @LOCATION2, and the history of the country. Without the computer I would not have been able to learn about this fasinating country. On a computer you can also learn about historic and famous people. On computers you can read biographies of them, or watch videos of whay they did to become famous. People used to read news out of a newspaper, on computers you can too without paying the cost of buying a newspaper. Hi, Jenny Well, as you asked me Jenny, the most brilliant actor than see before is Vin Deasel, it is an excellent professional and he protagonized a great deal of movies like the saga of Fast and Furious, Ridic , Nannies bulletproof and other extras films. To begin with is design,we are able to considerate backgroud colour ,artwork,and security issues,and then,we are supposed to preparing mental plates,such as skilled and machinists. On computers you can also communicate with people that are very far away. Scientist did a study on how people communicate. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 said they used a computer to comunicate with other people. People can use a webcam, aim, or email to communicate with other people. To communicate with my family in @LOCATION2 I use a webcam. To communicate with my friends I use email or aim. Writing letters is to slow, on computer the other person your talking to can reply immediately. On a computer communication is made easier. A computer can also teach you hand-eye cordination. On a computer you see something on the monitor and you can click it without looking down at the mouse to click. This can help you in sports and give you fast reflexes. In many sports you need hand-eye cordination. For example, in basketball you need to look up while you dribbling or you while fall. Computer can give people fast reflexes and helps people in sports. Computer should be part of societys everyday life. Computer have a positive effect of people and they can help people learn new things, like, places, people, and news in the world. the development technology and Industry very fast , so the public transport no future , Must be Interesting the development transport Even fits the times."	4.5

"A large amount of people use computers daily, but not everyone agrees this technology benefits society. I think that computers benefit our way of life in many ways. This very useful technology has a positive effect on people because, it allows people to send, receive, and research a vast variety of information easily. we will know today some of information about Islam , Islam is great religion come from The Arabian Peninsula and its founded since 1436 years ago. They say that this powerful technology has been more effective and quicker. My cousin and I were both given the same research paper to do. He used several books to get information on the topic and I used the computer. The project took me @NUM1 days to do, while it took him a whole week to complete. @PERSON1, computer programming expert, said, ""Computers have made receiving information so much faster. I vehemently believe that everyone should own this device. Moreover, computers help with communication. There are many ways to keep in touch with people over the world, like email, chat rooms, and websites like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. These websites are a great tool to keep in touch with family and friends or even fans. @PERSON2, lead singer of the band @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, said ""@CAPS1 is a way to talk to the fans directly ad post updates about upcoming tours and albums. Not only isit great for bands but it is great for college students. My older brother is a college student and we communicate through these websites so it seems like he is never that far away. The computer can also help with business. Meeting can be done through @ORGANIZATION2 or a different webchat service. Emails are a great way to send information. @NUM2 of business meetings are held over the internet has benefited work ethics. Please heed my advice and use the internet and computer. We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben, which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye.To got to the Big Ben we took the underground, but to get to the London Eye a red bus.After 3 days we went home.I forgot to tell you something about homeless people.A lot of people are homeless, which is sad, but maybe we can change it."	4.5
678	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Some people might say that we should plan carefully and be ready for our future. For some aspects, this can be true with its stability for long-term goals. However, we can't win big and move forward if we miss the chances due to the fearness of risk and failing. In my opinion, taking risks or chances  in life is more successful than planning carefully with these 2 reasons: High rewards, the improvement of fluent working  and the limit of chances. To begin with, most of the chances with some risks also have high rewards. Work with high risks might seems to be dangerous and difficult to handle. However, there waits high rewards for people who can indure those risks. Giving an example, think of a situation that you are a college student who wants to listen to a famous professor's lesson. Although you know that many participants will apply for that lesson, the advantages of the lesson is great. The professor will teach students with passion and give good grades, which can make your university life more easy and convenient. For this situation, you should try applying even if there are some chances that you can fail. The rewards overwhelm the disadvantages. This is why avoiding risks without searching for them is not recommended and is unefficient. On top of that, you can also improve your fluently working ability. There are a few people are using puplic transport, like students and someone had low income.in my veiw, i can say might be the puplictransport going to e close because nobody is going to beclose For instance, the homework duration can be shortened due to the sudden change of your schedule, and this can ruin your homework plan. Then, the thing you should do is to change the plan and make a new schedule. In this case, you can adapt to the sudden change quicly and efficiently if you have experienced the same situations before. In other words, experiencing various risks and chances can improve your working ability to fluently re-schedule. Not only that, there also exist limitation of the chances. The chances don't wait for those whom are not ready for them. You have to make the chances into your results when they come to you. From the chances to pick your dinner to the chances to pick your lifetime career, you should be ready for them. This is why you the experience of choosing and taking risks is important. To sum up, risks and chances would be more successful choice than safe and careful planning with the aspects of rewards and limitation of chances in life. There will be many choices in our life, and there does not exist a perfect decision for them. However, the risks are the thing we should always be prepared. At the end, the kind of live that we will see in fifty years from now will have a lot of stuff to help the people to have a more comfortable, easier and faster way of live, but this will be only to meke more money and consume more and more, also the things will be faster of waste to make the people to change their apparel more often and create a consumerism."	4.5
679	"In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good student? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"Many students may wonder if they are good students or not. And many people may had tried to be a good student in the class. Then, what is a good student? There are two main qualities of a good student. First of all, good students should have enthusiasm. Students can learn and memorize more knowledges when they study by themselves than when they are forced to study. However, without enthusiasm of learning, they just study because they have to study. This kind of study which have no purpose, is not helpful for students. Therefore, to be a good student, students should have passion for study. Not only passion, curiosity is also the quality for a good student. Today personal vehicle become pride of the life , mean if a person is on there personal vehicle they are look as higher status in the society . The origin of questions is curiosity. If students don't feel curious about the knowledge, his or her studying will be end just by understanding and memorizing it. However, if students finish studying with old knowledges that already written on the paper and do not create new ideas, the world can't be developed. The final purpose of studying is to make a new theory or technology based on old knowledges. Accordingly, curiosity is the important quality of a good student to think and create a new knowledge by asking a question. To summarize, the qualities of a good student are having enthusiasm of learing and having curiosity for what they learned. It is because, these two qualities help students to study by themselves and think creatively. It might be difficult to be a good student in a day, but if you try consistently to have a passion and feel curious in the class, then you can be a good student."	4.5
680	Government: Some people think that governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology. Other people disagree and think that this money should be spent on more basic needs. Which of these opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Computer Technology Is Most Important to Development

Science and engineering are most important part of nowadays. Korea governments spend money to develop them for strength of nations. Science and engineering include a lot of majors, and computer technology is one of them; moreover, it spread the width of the scholar faster, so it is connected other study closely. People who reach 18 have to complete military service is an issue, the supporters suggest that is helpful for the 18 to train the physical fitness and psychological quality, whilst opponents point out that is harmful for the human right and affect development of the country. In my opinion, the government should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying that because computer technology is most important part. First of all, computer technology is core part of making nations safety. For example, there are too much technology about using or control weapons with computers like using super computer for find and remove enemy's airplanes. Developed Computer technology is basic of them; moreover, that technology makes weapons to protect more stronger. It is important especially for Korea because of awareness of war. In addition to the first reason, computer technology contribute making newest industry. For example, after invention of internet, many industry that use the internet appear; furthermore, they hire a lot of people and make huge markets never be appeared before. That situation makes economy bigger and faster; therefore, people get lots of benefit for internet, a kind of computer technology. Some argue that basic science should be grown by governments more because it makes basis of other engineering. However, developed computer engineering contribute to study basic science also. For instance, in dry chemistry labs, they use complicated computer modeling to find some model about interaction between atoms or other materials. That study needs highest developed computer program. Other basic sciences like biology, physics, and mathematics also need computer technology for modeling, simulation, and proof study. Nowadays a person's worth seems to be judge  according to the social status and material possessions, that is mostly to happen in high class famiies, as they are foccus on achievements as power, political influences etc. Nowadays, the government show movements that reduce spending money for science, include computer technology. Even if the government has not a vary money, it should be spend money for computer technology not only development of computer science but also development of Korea."	4.5
681	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" The university has a certain timetable for lectures. For example, in the case of KAIST, 1 hour and 15 minutes of lecture for one class period, and has a 15-minutes break between class. In addition, all these timetable cycles begin at 9 a.m. Of course, depending on how students sign up for classes, the total number of classes students take on each day, ans the first class times varies from person to person. However, students can't escape the big frame and only within the timetable system. I would like to change this timetable cycle for the following reason. Its  popularity spreads all over world too.There are many reasons behind it to be popular.Everyone is able to enjoy the excitement throughout of this game the session.The people who eager to play football must follow some basic rules which are described below: 1.A football player should be punctual and hard-working. As mentioned before, KAIST's first class starts at 9 a.m. By the way, KAIST students lack sleep time and sometimes stay up all night due to lot of sudy and research activities. Firstly,the city of Vancouver has a programme called go green Vancouver that it will protect the environment selecting the rubbish by containers at the same time there is a collaboration from the city hall of any district that it will provided a 3 containers for each house one for papers one for bottles y the last one for rubbish materials. This phenomonon can be easily seen even during the signing up class period. Even in the same professor's class, class that start at different times are much more popular and reach the quota faster than classes that start at 9 a.m. Therefore, I'll postpone the entire timetable system for an hour and change it to start at 10 a.m. The second reason is 75 minutes is a long time for students ans professors to stay focused only on their lectures. According to some neurooscopic studies, the human brain can not concentrate more than 50 minutes on one thing. Therefore, I would like to decrease lecture time per class. but i have never felt that the entire class for whole week is too long. So, considering that we are taking 150 minutes per week based on 3-credit course, I'll change to 3 classes for 50 minutes each. After that, students' concentration during lecture and their grades will also increase. To sum up, I want to increase KAIST students' sleeping time and concentration during lecture. Because of these 2 reasons, I want to change timetable system of KAIST. Specifically, postpone the entire timetable system for an hour and make 50 minutes lecture for one class period."	4.5

Yet looking back you forget what was so funny. Laughter is magical, @CAPS7 behind love. Those two seem to go hand in hand. When you love someone, not just you boyfriend/girlfriend but you friends @CAPS1 family too, you know how to make them laugh or cheer them up, how to have fun with them, @CAPS1 that brings you even closer together. When I'm with @CAPS16 friends the one thing we seem to do most is laugh. We laugh about anything @CAPS1 everything that is even slightly funny. It bring us closer together, sharing a moment of joy. The six of us are very close @CAPS1 will be friends after high @ORGANIZATION1 is over, even if we go to colleges a thousands of miles away. It is because we have shared so many happy memories. Laughter is important in a relationship. We trust each other @CAPS1 can share anything with them even our most important secrets. This story is how we came to be so close.

""I wouldn't really call that dancing...."" she made a pelvic thrust, we all burst into a new round of giggles @CAPS1 shouted stuff like, ""@CAPS2, get a room!"" We gossiped about what we saw, who was with who, pretty dresses, hot @CAPS4, creeper @CAPS4, slow dances, the music, even our @CAPS8 we hid our cups so we would know which one was ours when we wanted to use it again.We had all been friends, but recently we had been becoming closer. Starting to move from friends to best friends. It was at least @NUM1 @CAPS3. Everyone was exhausted but was forcing themselves to stay up with caffeine @CAPS1 sugar. You @MONTH1 ask why, but I'm not really sure. Maybe because we always seem to have so much to talk about, because we enjoy each others company, or just because we can, so why not? ""@CAPS4 I think we need a picture, a picture of the six of us."" I said.""@CAPS5!"" ""@CAPS6""""@CAPS7 now? I'm a mess!

There are various types of life style, but generally these are separated into earlier one or later one. I advise any one dream to be one of the most famous teams that works on hisself a lot & and play football a lot to be profectional in this sport & show a lot of matches &followed by captain supervised on him Some argue that getting up later is better. However, starting the day's work early is better choice for several reasons. First of all, the natural cycle of human body is set to follow the behaivor of the Sun. The Sun releases higher intensity of lights in the moring and lower intensity at night. In addition, human body is controlled by various hormones, which follow the intensity of Sun lights. For example, in the morning, some hormones which help us to get up are secreted, but the artificial lights cannot stimulate the activation of these hormones. Thus, it is natural to get up early in the morning. Next, the earlier life style is already a standard in most cultures. The society require the life style
Some argue that getting up early is hard, so doing later is better. However, this life style just results from a shift of life cycle. If they try to shift their life cycle to normal one, getting up early is not difficult. Moreover, the less exposure of sun lights can cause health problems such as the shortage of Vitamin D and social problems such as increasing electricity demand. To sum up, starting a daily life in the moring is essential to improve the level of life. This life style is natural due to the cycle of the Sun and Earth. Furthermore, it is widely selected in many countries. On the other hand, getting up later has various disadvantages to cause a lot of problems."	4.5

KAIST is really nice university and one of the best university in Korea. However, there is no perfect university. KAIST also has some problems. I think the location is worst thing of KAIST. So I want to change the location of KAIST from Daejeon to Seoul because of several reasons. First, there is no funny things in Daejeon. The bakery Sung-Sim-Dang is only landmark of Daejeon. Many KAIST students escape Daejeon to search some funny thing every weekend and their goal is Seoul. There is so many funny things in Seoul. Delicious foods, shopping malls, activities, shows, and so on. This is the first reason why I want to change the location of KAIST to Seoul. Second, my home is in Seoul. If KAIST is in Seoul, I can go home so easily and meet my mom and dad often. Also I lived in Seoul before enter KAIST, so I have many friends in Seoul. I want to see them more. In conclusion, I want to change the location of KAIST from Daejeon to Seoul because of these reasons. I know Daejeon is also nice city, but Seoul is more friendly to me.

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Do the members of this well-known and captivating newspaper think that the effects of people owning a computer are good or bad? Well, if you think negatively about computers and how they effect people, I would like to politely disagree. I'm certain I could sway you to agree with me too. Computers are positive for many reasons. The internet and other resources can be used for school, work, and other questions, the computer gives people something to do when otherwise they have nothing, and it allows people to talk to others online. There are many great effects computers have on and for people. Everybody has questions, wouldn't you agree? And more often than not, people don't know the answer right off the top of their head. Research is the key to answering questions. But who has time to go to the library and spend hours searching for an answer that would take a matter of seconds to find on the computer? Not every student, employee, or other person can spend that time looking for an answer. There are far too many other things to do! The internet on the computer allows people to find an answer quickly. This can actually improve people's knowledge, and their performance at work or school. You can see here the positive effects of a computer. Have any of you ever been bored? I'm certain that you have. Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real. If difficulties was told to the families, the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation. Contrary to some people's beliefs, this can be an excellent way to spend, not waste time. There are all sorts of educational games and mind-buggling puzzles to do on the computer. I'm certain you can see how much better these things are than sitting in front of the. The effects are positive, because your brain is challenged, and your boredom has vanished. Also, hand-eye coordination can be greatly improved by doing activities. These are so many positivities about the computers effect in people's boredom! People have friends, and it is only human to want to keep in close contact with them. But what if a close friend moves away? You don't want to lose that friendship right? People can write letters to each other, but that can be time consuming, and show to delivery and response. And the positive effect of a computer is it allows you to keep in contact online with friends and family instant messaging and email. both great resources for talking with others. Computers can keep friends together and save families from drifting apart. It is also good for couples or parents to keep in touch with their partner or children if they are away.

686	"Government: Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.    "	"Why Should Governments Spend More Money on Public Transportation

Until now, in Korea, many citizens use advanced public transportation anytime. Although many think that using public transportation is quite uncomfortable to transfer and physically hard, it has many individual and public advantages. In my opinion, governments should spend more money on improving public transportation for three reasons in different aspects: convenience, environment, and cost. Nowadays, public transportation is widely used for a long distance like Seoul to Pusan. In this case, using public transportation is more convenient than cars, because people don’t need to concentrate on their driving and ride comfort is not bad. For example, some college students like KAIST students use trains a lot to go dormitory. No matter what year, its lowest level always in Jan-Mar.May be because this paragraph of time the weather was cold, the purchaser greatly reduced.We can be seen from the diagram,  the highest peak in the has increased year by year, as the low as. Rather than using a car, if students use express bus or train, they can save a time and feel more comfortable. Second, public transportation is more eco-friendly than cars. If all citizens use their individual cars every day, a lot of carbon dioxide occurs in the air. This carbon dioxide would cause green gases which increase the temperature globally. However, if all of them use subways at once, it could save the clean air from air pollution. Furthermore, some transportations work by electric energy, so they don’t release any polluted gas. On the other hand, some argue that the public transportation is quite expensive. However, there are lots of events to discount the transportation expenses; for example, traveling with four friends in KTX can halve the KTX fee. Not only the transportations with a long distance, but also subways have some great discount system in Korea. If the user transfers to another subway track, it just cost a little additional pay to travel a long distance. Plus, car also pays a lot of money on oil charging, so using car is not much economically beneficial than public transportation. In conclusion, spend more money on public transportation is much more beneficial than roads and highways. This book made me interesting and I begging reading more and more while I read the more I love it  this time everything  did not matter to me I want to finish the book  as soon as possible I do not know the end but I want the end of the book was amazing but the same time I do not finish the book because the mystery to open up finished in. There will be more advanced public transportations created that many enjoy them to get in workplace or travel."	4.5

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Almost everyone in the @LOCATION1 uses a computers at one point in their life. Computers are a way to teach hand eye coordination through programs, games and typing. The internet can be used for researching different far away cultures, as well as someone's own lifestyle. This compact well made piece of technology has been belaming more and more intricate. Realizing how much help computers have in everyday life, people will be the down fall or support for computer technology moving forward. One very basic but evident result from using a computer is hand-eye coordination. Since the time children are in grade school, they learn typing on a keyboard. People who reach 18 have to complete military service is an issue, the supporters suggest that is helpful for the 18 to train the physical fitness and psychological quality, whilst opponents point out that is harmful for the human right and affect development of the country. When I was small, a mere fight years old, I remember typing. I was always excited when my mom and I went to barnes and noble to pick up a new typing program. I especially enjoyed ""type to learn"" and @CAPS1 typing lessons as well as teaching children to type is general, teaches hand-eye coordination in high school, college, and the job world. Young adults and adults are expected to type papers, resemes, and applications. In this day in age the technology era has begin and typing is a necessity. Another way to teach hand-eye coordination is through computer games. A simple challenge like solitaire, bejewled or car racing teach the skill and much more advanced games for example, world of war craft need perfect coordination can be through typing and games, both on the computer. Though some experts are conserned ""people are spending too much time on the computer and less time..enjoying nature,"" you are able to learn about geography, travel, and nature. One amazing on a computer is the world wide web. This consists of millions of websites, pages, search engines, and information arte you in an upcoming geography uses?

We all know whats wrong, and what's right. Every school is different. Often the evolution is return of origins however I hope that the man in the next years will be to don't forget the past. If you're sixteen and reading a @PERSON2 book, then that's too inappropriate for their age limit. Every age is different, so your not going to find some forty-three year old hobo on the streets reading, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS1' by @PERSON2. Most likely, he'll be reading a mystery book, or something appropriate for his age not for someone that's five. Books shouldn't be banned because some elementary mother doesn't want her seven year old reading '@CAPS4'. Just because some mothers want it banned, doesn't mean it should be. Be smarter and watch what your kids are reading, it shouldn't have to be banned from other children just because you don't want your kid reading it. Don't we all agree that music is life? Not everyone has to listen to rap, nor do they have to listen to opera. Don't you see that we have musical artist in the world that depend on music? So why should rap be banned just because it talks about killing, drugs, and drinking. I say who cares? Don't listen to it if you don't like it, it doesn't mean you have to ruin it for everyone else. I love all kinds of music, so nothing should be banned. In my opinion I hate christian songs, I think they're too slow, and constantly talking about @CAPS5, but that doesn't mean I should ruin it for everyone else, just because I hate it. Everyone is different, no one is the same. Music helps me gets through life, and I know it helps you get through yours too, it shouldn't be banned. Movies, movies, movies! Video games, video games, video games! We all love cuddling and watching movies together, but not all movies are right for us. Movies have ratings like video games do. Ratings show what's appropriate for a twelve year old verses a twenty-five year old. Adults would most likely be playing a rated @CAPS6 game, and watching rated @CAPS7 movies. Little kids about the age of six would be playing rated @CAPS8 games, and watching rated @CAPS9 movies. As you can see everyone is different especially when it comes to these things. Rated @CAPS7 movies usually have gore, sexual themes, strong language, and things little kids should never watch. It doesn't mean it should be banned, maybe blocked in your home, but not banned. In my opinion, I think all movies, books, music, video games, etc., shouldn't be banned. It just should all be carefully watched to see who's hands it lands into, and who's eyes are viewing it. about my rest of family , as I said before they are just a relatives , but even if they are not friends almost ,but I do love them to much ,first one is my aunt ,the dead one ,and the other who still alive ,but i don't feel that felling of love towards my uncle , I do love him ,but he is just my uncle no more . No one should tell me what not to read or watch: unless I am a youth. Secondly,tourism,especially in developed countries,has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view.There are countries,such as Greece or Bulgaria,in which the econmoy relies merely on tourism.If tourism influences the econmy,it thereby influnces the environment,and if it influences the environment it influences the transport.How?people become more careful at their historcal sites,this way preserving them;Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale:At a small scale,in cities, in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently.At a large scale,people can now travel in almost any possible way:on land,on sea or air.Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations."	4.5

Over the years many well-written books have been on a 'censored list', meaning that they are at a risk of being removed from the library. 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1', '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2', and '@CAPS3 to @ORGANIZATION3' are all examples of books that have been marked down as being offensive. These books are all written in a style of their own and can bring a different lesson to every reader. While one reader @MONTH1 love the story and wear out the pages, another @MONTH1 get halfway through and never finish it. However, the belief that there is freedom of choice in reading is correct. 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON1 is a classic example of a censored book. Throughout the book there is foul language used that is considered offensive to some. and we must lern children that clean is necessary for their health and on their school they should throw rubbish on Waste basket and who throw it on the ground Will be punished . Books like this should be saved for older generations to read; however, we also have to realize that if a parent allows their children to read that book at a young age, there is nothing that can be done about it. None-the-less, removing the book from the library is not the correct response. Ever heard the saying 'learn from past mistakes'? Books are a fantastic way to learn about the past in a fun and enjoyable way. They are a tool of knowledge. Removing a book from a library is like removing hundreds of pages of knowledge. Every story has a unique style, which @MONTH1 appeal to some and not to others. Many books give readers a deeper understanding of what the time period was like when the book was written. '@ORGANIZATION2' has been a known censored book from the beginning due to its somewhat dark and gloomy aspects at certain points throughout the story. How many kids do we see at school carrying around one of the '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2' books? They often state that it is their favorite book of all time. If the book were to be removed from the library, it would cause many students to never have the opportunity to read a fantastically written book, which has a unique style about it. Throughout our twelve years of school, students are taught to think for themselves and make their own decisions. How are we encouraging this if we are removing materials from their grasp? If we cannot let students make such a simple decision as to whether or not to read a book, we are teaching poor life lessons."	4.5

situation. Then, why people want to travel? I think, for these three reasons, people travel with their family, friend, or
alone. The service is very bad the drivers are very angry and stressed out these do not lead with cauition, in Toluca exist report of high rates of accidents by buses. Nowadays, there are so many works, businesses and stresses in
our society. So people want to take a rest. Above all,the design is the most previous way we should know,which is considered with the background color and artwork.Secondly,we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinsts.And the we need printing and inspection.Eventually,the most essential part comes out,we need significate the quality of the sheets.If it's good,packing and distributin whereas the others shoulde be distroyed as well. Convenient facilities and times give us more relax feeling. During the trip, don&#39;t have to clean our rooms! Because we don&#39;t have to do anything else, we can get our own break times. Secondary, travelling makes people&#39;s relationship more friendly. We usually go to travel with our family, friends or
sometimes anyone(such as package trip product). In that case, we can make our relationship more friendly. Eating
and sleeping together, we can talk with others about special things. Through this process, we can learn how to plan
more efficiently, and how discuss with others. It can makes our relationship better. And we can also make new
relationship. During travel, we meet variety type of people. Sharing ideas, we can spread our relationship. Or
sometimes it can be a special relationship. Finally, people travel to get motivation. For example, when I was middle school student, my friend went to China trip
during the summer vacation. For 1 months, she visited Chinese Universities and met many kinds of people. And they
gave her valuable experiences. She told, &quot;That experiences were the most valuable things ever.&quot;. After this travel,

It has many problems that must be changed. I have two reasons why I want to change and solve this problem. First of all, the comfortability of our home is the critical component for our life. Although we live 2 or 3 people in our room, our present dormitory's size is absolutely small. We could not do anything except studying, sleeping, and talking in our room. We have to go gym to do home training. Likewise, we have to delivery the food or go to restaurant every time. We can not cook anything in our dormitory. These limits of our room make us uncomfortable. No matter what year, its lowest level always in Jan-Mar.May be because this paragraph of time the weather was cold, the purchaser greatly reduced.We can be seen from the diagram,  the highest peak in the has increased year by year, as the low as. If we live in large room, the quality of our life will be enhanced. Secondly, the location of dormitory is the important thing to determine our activity range. The KAIST dormitories are located in the end line of KAIST. He seems different, she never imagined that Jason can be like that, she fantasy with someone, brave and strong, and she never foresees something like this, but she feel something for him, maybe she is in love with this guy . We have a lot of energy to go library, restaurant, study room, and cafe. If I can change the location of dormitory, I will move them to more inside of KAIST. This examples make my opinion more reasonable. Based on the above reasons, I think if I can change one important thing about KAIST, I will change our dormitory to enhance satisfying of our life."	4.5

Other disagree and believe that governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. In my opinion, it is better for governments to spend this money for the public without exploring outer space for several reasons. First of all, governments have a duty to protect the health of its people. Despite the advances in medical technology, many people died because infections, cancer, and other new diseases. Therefore, the government should pay attention about patients and medical insurance or environment. COVID 19, a global epidemic, is an example of this. A report by 'The Korea News' said that South Korea covered all medical expenses for the public in Corona crisis. Like this, governments are interest in health care for their people always.

The people who live in a country said their inconvenience in their lives like transportation, house, or taxes to the government. Governments should divide their budget properly to various national policies.

"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 your life without computers. Writing articles on a typewriter or by hand would surely be a hassle. The question of whether or not computers are beneficial to society has risen in the media, where they argue that people spend less time exercising interacting with nature, and less time with their family. However, computers are a great step forward in modern science and are beneficial to communities. Computers have drastically helped out educationally at school, not to mention the easier way of connecting with friends and family. Also computers have so many different forms of entertainment. This first reason is all actors shown their talent in this film directly and audience can follow their steps and the story certainly, this essential element which also makes a big success to the film. Firstly, computers have helped academically in our schools and at home. I can't even @CAPS1 the hassle of coming home with thee assignment or writing two essays, only to have to write it by hand! Wanting to get it over with would only cause me to rush, resulting in a bad grade. Also, think of the handwriting factor. Most kids in my school don't have good handwriting, and I am assuming that teachers have a hard time grading something they can't read. With programs such as @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2, you are given the option of different fonts, colors, bolding, pictures, symbols, and so on. Another way computers have helped academically is in schools. More and more teachers are using computers to help us learn. Tests are taken on computers, websites to help us research are visited, and other @ORGANIZATION1 program such as powerpoint can be used for a project. Computers help a lot in school, while helping us learn so much more. Computers also help with keeping in touch with friends and family. The days of short letters are replaced with long emails with pictures attached, sent in a matter of seconds whizzing through the internet only to arrive on your friend's screen. People can save money by not having pictures developed but instead having them stored on their computer, ready to print onto boand paper. So my idea is aii the coutries allthe people stop to use farmland,forest andwetlang to build houses grow more trees portect our world,our homestar! Things such as cideo chat (vchat) where you can literally see and talk to the other person, or just audio chat where you can talk to the person, have been made. Such easy ways of communication motivate people to speak to family and friends and stay in touch. Computers have made a positive impact on community by havinf simple ways to talk to your loved ones. Computers can alos provide a fun source of entertainment on the web. Websites have been created where you can play games, find people from your past, or maybe just look out funny videos. Anything you type into your toolbar instantly transforms into a page of links websites where you con find details on your topic, or relative things one fun website is that of 'youtube'. This website lets people upload videos. The possibility are endless on the web. Another fun website is '@CAPS3'. This website is where you can 'friend' people you know from the past and interact with them. You can post viedos, write messages and such. As you can see, entertainment is everywhere on the web. The time is now to understand the full benefits of computers. Computers are a benefit to modern day society because they help academically, encourage you to stay in touch with family and friend, and provide entertainment.

Why are we now cautious of @CAPS1 our children pick off the shelf? Society today has changed the way we once viewed our sources of entertainment. Books are now viewed with skepticism and once harmless movies and magazines are full of material no one should be reading or watching. Music used to be a beautiful form of art, but now when you turn on your radio, @CAPS1 do you hear? Mindless spewing of words linked together with curses and other garbage. Should libraries use caution when renting something to someone who shouldn't be using that material for harmless entertainment. There once was a young girl, fourteen or fifteen, who loved to read and listen to music. She was bright but shy, and used books as her friends. Each day she walked to the library for a new story to dive in. One day she came across a book on the top shelf of the fiction section. Today personal vehicle become pride of the life , mean if a person is on there personal vehicle they are look as higher status in the society . She reached for the book, intrigued, and flipped through the pages. Her innocent and naive mind caught a hold of a world she didn't know. After reading the book, she was filled with guilt. It wasn't a good book, but a book that was laced with a harmful message. This young girl, once pure and simple, now knew things no one at that age should know. So, why wasn't there a warning of some sort? The difference between writing something offensive and being offensive is that the writer usually doesn't intend to be hurtful or rude. The author most likely intended for the peice of literature to be enjoyed with a clear and playful attitude. However the comparison between writing something offensive and being offensive is far different. When you read something in a book or magazine that disturbs you, put it down, or throw it away. No one is forcing you to read the material. Yet, the real question is; @CAPS1 about our children? How do we keep them safe from offensive literature? And @CAPS1 about music? Or movies? Remember the old black and white films? How, no matter @CAPS1 the plot or storyline is, the two leading roles somehow fall in love in the end? The ending title fills the screen just before the two actors share a kiss and then the screen goes black. Mind, there are still movies with happy endings and a positive message. @CAPS1 about the other films? Some of the biggest blockbusters are those which have either violence, some form or racism, and/or sexual content. Personally going to the movies to see a new action movie that looks thrilling and entertaining should be fun, but where does the fun stop? After the guy in the first scene has just been brutally murdered? Or after the two lovers share a special bond that should be kept private? And @CAPS1 happens when this movie is released and checked out from the library by a young boy who just wants a fun sleepover with his friends? How do we keep these sorts of material away from them? Libraries should use major caution when priting labels to place on their books, movies, magazines, etc. Librarians should make sure that the book a child hands to them is safe to read for that age level. Also, they should check the ratings on movies or make them not available to certain age group. So if you want to work in Egypt you must have a complete information about the job (location ,salary,incentives, Allowances , work environment,position titles , company type,policy ,mission,vision)                                                                                               With best Wishes                                                                                                Sameh Sabbagh Make sure they see something fun, but with a positive message. Should libraries take certain material off their shelves? When freddy begin to sings the kids screams and they sing with Freddy the famous Freddy Fazbear´s Song,Bonny plays the battery and Chica serves the pizza to the children, This year the stablishment close because they found the body of a dead child.

Other people disagree and think that this money should be spent on more basic needs. Which of these opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"After the development of ENIAC, world's first computer, over 50 years had past. Since then, computer technology became currently most important technology in civilization of twenty-first century. my town tries all the time to make our town more beautiful and comfortable by taking more care of the environment,they provide us by good buses which are friends to the environment and offer the tickets for this buses in a cheap price,they also trying to find the best way to make the rubbish more useful by the recycling,also the people tries all the time to find the best way for keep our village clean;they never throw the rubbish in the streets or the gardens,also they take care of the fuel in their cars to not to be bad for the environment,so,it's our duty to take care of our village and the whole environment beside the government. However, there are some groups disagreeing to this modern flow and suggest that nations should use budget instead for basic needs too. Despite these argues, governments must spend as much money as possible for computer technology for few reasons. First of all, computer technology brings great amount of rich for country. As smartphone is invented, mankind can now access to internet and computer anywhere anytime, and almost every industries need computer to develop and create products. Moreover, due to changes called 'fourth industrial revolution', factories started to be operated by computers, and cars started to drive by itself. Adolescent has always been the hardest part throughout anybody's whole life.. turning out in a fleeting glimpse into an adult, perceiving the other side of life,how tough and complicated it is, trying to deal with its different circumstances.. at this point you merely have a brief look at your whole life, many questions spinning in your head, accusing yourself of being a lost cause, wishing if you could turn the clock back,,but it's all no good.. then you find yourself standing ahead clouds of reality, which sucks.. life is stages, this stage of your life is timeless, no way out.. at some point you wish if it was all illusio, you need a time machine makes it possible to go back in time when you could see the purity of life.. However..here you are completely different made of life lessons, preferring to make a stiff upper lip..cowering in your own reality. Also, IT technology are not effected to nation's environmental condition. While manufacturing industries such as oil companies require certain resources, computer industries are not. In addition, biggest benefit of IT technology is that companies can earn great amount of money with less amount of employees; therefore, even countries with small population can be wealthy. Being too hot or too cold is not a matter too. No matter how weather is, computer industry can be developed if only internet is connected; thanks to amazon's AWS service, server computer with large size isn't required too. IT industry is literally open for anyone and any country. Even though there exists argument that using these money for poor and reducing rich-poverty gap will help citizens live better life, it is not true, and computer technology will be more beneficial for people. Using tax for social welfare is never a bad thing, but taking those efforts from investment for future is bad thing. Computer technology can increase nation's GDP, and it leads to increase of income for every citizens. Therefore, without spending more account for social welfare, quality of life can be increased for everyone. Thanks to internet and computer, people are able to enjoy their life and hobby even during pandemic quarantine. Computer technologies still have great unforeseen future, and size of market is constantly increasing for over 20 years. They have limitation for neither resource nor environment, and provides tremendous amount of wealth. In conclusion, investing as much as government can to the industry will be the best choice."	4.5
696	University: Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"Available Higher Education for Only Good Students, Evolving Education
People are born and take compulsory education for an average of 10 years. one day Michael decided to make a surprise party to sinha to make her happy and feel his love more so he arranged everything and to keep it surprise to her he was busy all the time and did not show off all the week as usual .that make sinha worried and suspect that Michael do not love her any more and know another girl and she become extremely sad and even it become worse when Michael asked her to go to his apartment to make  the surprise to her  but he did not answer his phone after that . However, in the case of higher education, there are many pros and cons as to whether it should be provided to all students or not. In my opinion, higher education should only be provided to some of the best students for the following reasons. First of all, providing higher education to every student wastes money, time and manpower. Just because every student has a higher education does not mean they understand it. Higher education literally means ‘intensified' education for some subject. In other words, students who do not have sufficient prior knowledge in that field may have a difficulty to understand the higher education. We have Eather first than people thanour house.Eather is our home,we all have to protect it.But now people are distroy it.Just for mony for more house but if we destroy it we will all die our money will gone our house will gone we will have nothing.Beside some people destroy farland to build houses but if one day there is no farmland than what should we eat?Nothing at that time we can eat nothing!So what should we do? In addition to waste of sources problem, providing higher education to only excellent students will help students find their real value. Everyone has their own talents. That talent could be study, dance, or song. Depending on these talents, everyone will choose a different job. In this case, many jobs in society all demand different skill, but higher education could not educate all these skills. As in following example, the skill needed by a tile mechanics is to squeeze silicone well, not to solve calculus problems well. Rather, higher education in mathematics will only take effect when it is provided to a friend who is good at math. Until now, many have argued that not providing higher education to all is a violation of the principle of equality. However, providing opportunities of higher-education only to good students can prevents all students from taking the same career path. For example, in Korea nowadays, higher education opportunities are available to all students. Therefore, a great part of Korean high school students enter college unconditionally, even if they do not have a subject they want to learn at college. The main reason for this is that the social perception sees students who didn't go to college as losers. I think this problem can be prevented if college education in a specific field is provided only to students who are excellent in a specific field. In conclusion, allowing higher education only to excellent students prevents wasted money, time and manpower and helps students create individual their value. Korean society considers those who cannot go to college as losers. However, this is a misconception. Even if some students do not have a college education, but they know their true worth and works on their dreams, they will be a real success."	4.5

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers these days have made positive changes to all of our every day lives. In public transport people bound to share transport means with strangers and also we have to persue company policy or regulations,but with their own transport we don't have to bother about these things we travel when we want and when we have time. While social networks are great and all, computers can also make work extremely easy and proffesional-looking. They can also perfect the skill of hand-eye coordination. But with that in mind, is the computer truly a harmful or helpful device? Sometimes we wonder where our long lost friends and relatives have gone and how they are. Well, with the computer and internet access, you can easily contact them through great social networks such as @CAPS1. I hear it all the time from everyone that reunions have been made, and friends have been reunited. And reuniting friends, you can also make new ones with a simple click of a button. Isn't making more friends and reconnecting so easy now? Computers nowadays offer wonderful software from @ORGANIZATION2 that can make making slideshows, projects, and reports far easier. Third, this is the most important step that printed sheets manually inspected,the this sheets are classified three areas.The number one called good quality sheets,they will be packed and dispatched.The next called partially damaged shees,and bank notes separaed into good and bad, good sheets will be cutted into separate bank notes and packed,the bad one will be destroyed by fair.The number three called bad sheets ,they will be securely destroyed. All we did was take the pictures, upload them to his laptop, and then we added captions to all of the pictures. We did an amazing, professional job on the project and received an A-. Though I understand that in the process of computer-usage, people hardly find time outdoors, the technological advance will enhance hand-eye coordination. Imagine this: You're up at bat in a baseball game. @NUM2 strikes and @NUM3 balls is your count. Everyone is cheering you on. The pitcher pitches the ball and wham! You swing that bat and hit yourself a homerun! Do you know what skill was used to hit that ball? That's right - hand-eye coordination. So now while everyone is wondering what sort of effect the computer has, remember how easy that work was for me. Also think back to that baseball player. You know, the one that hit the homerun using hand-eye coordination. But most importantly remember how easy it would be to contact the ones you love most and keep closest to you. The computer is a positive advance in society, and everyone should be assured so!"	4.5
698	Lifestyles: Some people prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day’s work. Others prefer to get up later in the day and work until late at night. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.	"Why the Early Bird Catches the Worm
        Sleeping is a basic way to relax for all organisms. Thus, sleeping is necessary for human although it needs very long hours; the sleeping time human needed is about from seven to ten hours. Some says that getting asleep and waking up early should be better to spare daytime. On the other hand, others argue that getting up later is better to use the nighttime. In my opinion, getting up in the morning and starting the day's work has two benefits. First of all, humans usually concentrate well after getting up. Assume that enough time for sleeping is provided, and then all parts of body, especially human's brain will get enough time to rest; therefore, the concentrating ability is usually maximized after getting up. Notice that people usually have some plans that cannot be canceled due to the importance in afternoon. If there are not only a personal work to concentrate but also some plans in the afternoon such as meeting, sparing the time in the morning by getting up earlier will help to work with high efficiency. In addition to high concentration, getting up early helps to take health. To begin with,the format of the bank notes needs to be designed,factors of considerations including the background colour,the artwork and the security issues.Sencondly,equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps.Thirdly,print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink,where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes. Getting asleep late at night is not helpful for growing up for children. Furthermore, the period of hormones are disturbed by getting asleep late at night because some hormones are used for human's body during sleeping. Human's body is set for the custom, which is getting up early and sleeping early. Some argue that after working, leisure is need before sleeping. They think that there must be a gift after doing a hard-work. However, sleeping must be the gift, not other leisures. Note that the time of leisure is not fixed. If any leisure activities are conducted between the work and sleeping, the leisure activities will cause non-periodic sleeping and make the health worse. To sum up, getting up early is necessary since sparing the daytime gives efficient works, and helps to keep all parts of body healthy. The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country.This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years Getting up early will lead to sparing time, working with high concentration, and finally there are some space to have leisure. Early bird catches not only the worm but also other parts of happiness."	4.5

Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"In my personal opinion, I do believe that certain materials whether it be in books, music, magazines, or movies be romoved or edited more carefully. Most parents, including mine, expect their kids to behave with manners and not use foul language or make out with their boyfriend or girlfriend in inappropriate times, and yet we promote it and that's unacceptable. In bookstores or even libraries, they have some books on the shelves that can be considered inappropriate. We encourage and even push kids to read, but we can't even say, pick any book you want. These books @MONTH1 have foul language, gang violence, or even sexual jestures that I wouldn't even consider giving to a niece or a baby cousin. There are many types of music out in the real world. Everyone has their favorite music and they have their least favorite. In my opinion, you can't make everyone happy so your just going to have to ignore it. There are different cd's, cassate tapes, or even records, that you can buy. Yes, I think what some people put in their music is not appropriate but we can always change the station on the radio. You don't have to purchase that cd, and you can always ride with no music on. Magazines can get pretty ugly sometimes. As Automotive Industries are huge in market, most of the  house holders  prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time . Quite frankly, I don't mind seeing that in magazines but strict parents @MONTH1 not want their kids being exposed to @NUM1 actions. Magazines could talk about anything such as someone on drugs, alcohol, or winning the lottory. You just have to choose what you and your kids look at wisely. People can get pretty crazy on what they do and how they do it. Whether it be in writing, singing, or pictures, you know there is always someone going to do something inappropriate. This is reality and there is nothing that we can do about it. People complaint about how the information about different TV shows don't contribute in the process of learning, that's why many of This programmes are considered trash, because of the multiples shows such as realities, talk shows,or showbiz that hardly ever have a good message or something interesting for people. If you dont want to see it, don't buy it. Its quite simple"	4.5
700	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"It is not important for college student to have a part-time job as it may not offer what is required for the students. Whether a not college students need the job is dependent on their financial needs and also their priorities. College life may have long breaks in between the semesters which serve as a very timely period for doing a part-time job which can finance the students' expenses or luxurious spending such as getting a new smart phone or accessories. Students who have other priorities such as getting good grades or having a better portfolio would rather spend time doing an internship in a company or to prepare for the upcoming modules they have to take. For students who are financially burdened, a part-time job is important for them to fulfil their daily needs. However, for those who are not, it can merely serve as a mean to fill their excess time and it also comes with monetary reward. Some may argue that working part-time can help a college student manage their time more effectively, especially if the part-time job is done regularly during semester period as there will be lesser time spare for the student to do their academic work. However, having a co-curricular activity or taking up a leadership position in various groups can better enhance the students' college life. Therefore, I believe that the importance of having a part-time job for students in college is not necessary unless by circumstances or by the needs that the students have to satisfy."	4.5
701	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"These days, many college students tend to stay at home without having part-time job because of self-improvement. Of course, this behavior gives them a lot of time that spend self-improvement. However, I agree that college students have part-time job. There are some reasons why I agree it. First, college students keep spirit of independence. For example, they endure hard duties for a month to earn the money. These processes encourage themselves and foster their independence. In addition to, the survey of student council shows that students who experience part-time job have independence about four times compared with ones who didn't experience part-time job. Second, college students are able to pay the school expenses. According to civic organization's survey, seventy percent of college students pay their registration fee in installments with the money to earn for themselves during vacation. Otherwise the public transport don't pollute but the car pollute so for us travelling by car is better than travellng by public transport but for the atmosphere is better travelling by  public transport than travelling by car It is reported that employees who experience part-time quickly job adjust to new environment compared with employees who didn't experience part-time job. In addition to, college students who have part-time job can obtain the information that help them find the job. For these reason, I highly agree that college students have part-time job; spirit of independence, school expense, adaptability."	4.5
702	"Government: Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.    "	"The Tremendous Effect Of Public Transportation

In today's turbulent society, it is difficult for us to determine the best way to help the world. One of the ways is to improve the quality of transportation. In my opinion, spending more money on improving public transportation is more important than roads and highways. To begin with, environmental problems are a more urgent concern than developing the roads. People are indeed living in a society where environmental pollution is getting more serious. Yesterday ,I had a wonderful day  .In the morning I went to a Galician basketball training with a coach of Spanish selection ,when  finished went to my parents to a hotel to eat and stay with some friends , after the food meet with  friend´s of my parents and went to a theme park and we rode to a rollers coaster, it was very exciting and we ate a chocolate ice cream, it was delicious .At night we went to a match  of Spanish basketball league, Obradoiro versus Real Madrid and that match won the team of Real Madrid and then I went home to sleep. They die when John was too little to remember and he never know what happened so he went to all the parts for saw them even he walked and walked even at reverse but he never found them. To resolve this problem governments should slightly improve public transportation to encourage people to save the world and address the seriousness of air pollution. Secondly, it is possible for economic growth to be active. When public transportation is more activated, economic benefits are increased not only for individuals but also for the nation. In the case of public transportation, some of the profits are included as taxes used by the public in the transportation sector, so the more it is used, the more improvement it will make in the transportation sector. Moreover, public transportation costs little. For example, the maintenance fee for things such as engine replacement, fuel charging, tire replacement is high compared to public transportation prices. Thus, it is better to improve public transportation. Some people argue that improving roads and highways can have a greater effect on traffic jams than improving public transportation, and it will cost less in the long run. However, traffic congestion in crowded places is not solved in the first place because of the high density of the roads in Korea. Besides, there is no more room for road expansion in this high-density country. Since Korea is already developed as much it could, it is better to develop public transportation to increase efficiency on existing roads than to expand roads. In conclusion,  the government should spend money on improving public transportation rather than road and highways. It helps boost the economy as it consumes money in the transportation market and better for our environment."	4.5
703	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are many reasons that I think working part-time is a good idea. The first advantage comes into my mind is that students can earn money for their allowance by their own. They are not their families' burden anymore. Some outstanding students can even be financially independent. Second, people who earn money by themselves will not spend money because they want to but because they need to. Since they earn every penny by their own, they understand the value of money and learn to cherish it. Besides, in order to maintain normal school performance, it is meaningful for college students to learn how to manage their time well. Time management is vital at all time. This attitude reduced enromous amount of smoke pollution from the pipes.Government policy changes help a lot for water preservation.Many factories follwing the regulations and not draining the harmful wastage in the water. When dealing with problems, they understand the worth of cooperation and identify their responsibilities. However, some people may still disagree that college students have part-time jobs. They think all students have to do is focus on their academic works. Having part-time jobs will not bring positive influence on their school performances. But as I have explained before, it is not always true. Although school performance is important, it doesn't mean everything. Also, part-time jobs can teach students something that they can't learn in school. I think students who have part-time jobs acquire more benefits than those who don't."	4.5

It is something to do when you are sitting at home and also when you are in the classroom. School libraries are filled with defferent varieties of books and magazines and such. Some of these books could be arguably offensive to some people. These books should not be taken away from the library shelves. There are some books that some people find so offensive that they can not even continue to read the rest of the book. Whether it be sexual or even political, if the reader finds it offensive they will not read the rest of the book. There are books out there that describe in detail sexual scenes and many parents do not want their kids to read these kinds of books. This is no reason to remove the books from the library shelves. It @MONTH1 be offensive to certain people but if you took it off of the shelves it would not be available for others to read who can handle that kind of story. Parents' kids should simply not read these books. Libraries can not take the books away all together from readers who enjoy these kinds of books. There are also books about politics. Majority of people stand firm with politics and do not budge when it comes to discussing what they believe is right or true. When a reader comes across a book that is against the way they see politics, there can be a real problem. With politics being a serious matter, many people can overreact when someone tells them what they believe and think is true is really not. Travelling by car is convenient but there are dis advantage as well.As our population growing fast in a family both husband and wife working and children at university able to drive, so you are looking per house least 3 cars, so imagine how busy our roads will be.As now fuel price coming down that does not mean that it will stay like that for ever, price go up and down. Still, many authors write about political matters and some books can educate the reader about points that they have not yet seen before. If a reader does not agree with what the author is writing or they find it offensive, they should not read the book. There are plenty of other readers out there that would like to read that book and to learn more about politics. If a reader knows that this kind of reading offends them, then they should know better than to pick up the book in the first place. Many libraries offer music, movies and magazines to check out and to take home. It is true that many of these movies or the lyrics in the songs could strike someone as offensive. For this reason, they should not check them out. Many people enjoy music or movies that have offensive language. It is something that adds to the song or movie. People know their limits and if they know the contents then they should stay away. As long as there are other readers and people who like those kinds of books and music then they should keep them on the shelf. Taking them away would only take away from the number of people who visit the library. You could go to your local library and find people looking through the music section, and the music section is the only reason they come to the library in the first place. Transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible The people that are checking them out should be mature and responsible enough to know if they find the contents offensive. Libraries should not take certain books, movies, and magazines away that some people find offensive. Dear all I Am communicating to you, with the purpose of let yo know that we will set up a meeting at  my office with the purpose of discuss how we  could use social media to improve the Communication with our suplliers, i think a great time for the meeting could be next Monday at 4:00 p.m Kind regards Armando Martínez However, if it is offensive to the first person, it does not mean it will be offensive to the next. The libraries need to keep these sections in their libraries for all different kinds of readers. Reading is an extremely popular activity. Readers want a variety of books, music and movies to choose from."	4.5

This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. ""I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.""

This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese.

706	"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details."	"    In contemporary world, it is debatable whether it is better to choose a high-paying job with long hours that would give people little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give people more time with family and friends. Although some people argue that we should choose high-paying job, I believe that the lower-paying job with longer time to hang out is better than high-paying job with shorter time to hang out. First of all, a lower-paying job with long free-time is more beneficial than high-paying job with shorter free-time because it broadens our perspective. To be specific, longer free-time help people meet diverse people, which allows people to better understand other perspectives. As our society is becoming more globalized, the world requires people with wide views. However, if people should spend most of their time on work, they cannot hang out with diverse people. This leads to highly limited perspectives. Thus, in modern society, it is better to choose a job with more free-time even with lower pay so that they can widen their views. In addition, It is better to choose lower-paying job providing people with longer time to rest than high-paying job providing shorter time to rest because it relieves people's stress. In other words, spending more time with family and friends make people more laugh and enjoy their time, which helps people better manage their stress and maintain mental health. According to current studies, it was proved that more time to rest can reduce the probability of mental disease, while less time to less can lead to serious mental disease. Thus, it is better to choose lower-paying job with more time because people can maintain their healthy life. Nonetheless, some people cling to mistaken notion that high-paying job would help people better maintain their mental health in the long-term, because people can earn a lot of money in the future. Of course, it is important to invest for the future. However, if people have no time to enjoy the present, it can lead people to burn-out. Therefore, people cannot manage their mental health even in the long-term with less time to enjoy the present. To sum up, a lower-paying job with long time to enjoy the present would produce positive effects, such as widening people's perspectives and relieving people's stress. In conclusion, I firmly believe that a lower-paying job with longer time to relieve is more advantageous than a high-paying job with shorter time to relieve. Never should we forget that this issue may have huge impact on our future life."	5

"It has come to my attention that there is an argument about whetehe or not computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others."	5

Computer ease peples' lifes jarasticly. Besides esing lifes, computers teach you about far away places and people. pictures on a computer give one a first hand acount of how a far away place is like. Insead of just reading about it you can see it. Acording to time magazine if a person sees a place they will learn more by @PERCENT1 than reading an encyclopedia. As well as pictures, blogs give people an idea of how a person lives in a regular day in that place and how they feel about it. This is another first hand acount of the place. Finally, ebooks on the internet give you a large amount of information. Ebooks are books but in an internet format. These books inclued encyclopedias that give statistics and, pores, and events that are in the far of place. For example if you are planning a trip you can learn where to eat and where to get entertained. you can learn about far of places and people in them with computers. Lastly, with computers you can talk to people around the world. you can talk to friends. Have you ever moved and wanted to talk to a friend from where you previously lived? Now you can esily do so with video chat. Not ownly can you talk to someone you can see them. i remember @NUM1 years ago when I moved to @LOCATION1, I mised my friends in @LOCATION2 so i video chted them. As well as talking to friends, one can have a bussness meating around the world with out having to traval out of your town. For example if a company wanted to make a trading agreement with another company in @LOCATION3 they could do so with a click of a mouse. This will save time and money of travaling. Also you can talk to others online to get a feel of what happened. For example @CAPS2 a few weeks ago, video chated many people in @LOCATION4 to undersand now bad conditions were after earth quake. You can talk to people with ease with an computer availible. In conclusion, I believe computer are benifical to a society. They ease life, teach people about far away places and the people who live there, and alow people to talk to others. Computers open doors in the world. Computers help the society a great deal."	5

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1? Are you there?"" ""@CAPS2 you hear me?"" You never have that issue with computers. It has come to my understanding that there is a dispute about the benefits of computers - should we have them and advance them, or not? Well, I believe that computers are a necesity to an average person. Computers help everyone, and make life easier! Sure, there are cellphones and other helpful electronics, but @CAPS2 they always prove trustworthy? Computers are alwasy reliable - whether it's for homework or another reason! Computers provide easy interaction without breakups, they make it easier to learn, and if you are smart then they are safe. Without computers, who knows where our society would be? To begin, computers allow people to have conversations with others...that are halfway across the world! There are a variety of applications that you @CAPS2 choose from, and they are all easy to use. My personaly preffered option is @ORGANIZATION2 email. I myself have family in @LOCATION1, which is a whole continent away! Sure, I could call them, but my phone bill would be through the roof! How else am I supposed to keep intact with my loved ones? Do you know how many others face the same problem? Through a recent study, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 families in @LOCATION2 say they have relatives that are far away. That is @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's population! Imagine there was no computer for them to use. Phone companies would be in money and regular families would be living on the streets. Or worse - they would lose any relationship with their famly. Do you want that? Computers are easy to access, and you @CAPS2 interact with loved ones, friends, or new people. It doesn't get any better than that! So, which would you choose - losing your family relations or keeping in touch via email and computer applications? If that isn't enough, computers make it easy to learn new things and accomplish tasks. I know that as a student of @PERSON1, other students and I need to type our homework at least three times a week! Just yesterday I had to type up a response, a free writing choice, and an entry for a history project. Imagine if we had to go back to using typewriters. Either homework wouldn't be done or everyone would have a major lack of sleep. Both options are unacceptable. Plus, computers are great for research. If you have to look up a new country, look at far away colleges or find out about the world, why not visit your handy computer? You could learn which college is right for you without leaving your house. You could visit a new country without leaving town! Sure, you could read a newspaper, but answer me this where does the paper come from? Yup, trees are killed for them. Computers are the easy, environment friendly alternative for you. If those two reasons didn't convince you, maybe this one will. Most people think computers are unsafe, and that @MONTH1 be partly true. But if you are smart or listen in school like me, you will know that isn't always the case. In our school, we are taught about the risks of computers, and how to prevent any possible @CAPS3. I'm sure most schools do. In fact, nine out of ten students say that when it comes to safety, computers are rated an A+. Everyone knows about hackers, and so we avoid them. My parents even say that for over thirty years they have never had a single issue or risk of safety when using a computer, and neither have I. ""@CAPS3 are only powerful if you let them be, and let them take control,"" says @CAPS4, an expert on the subject. So, if it's safety you are worried about, then don't. The kids of today, and tomorrow, know what is out there, and how to stop the minor @CAPS3. So, why don't we recap what we learned today. Are computers helpful and the best way to go for communication? Yes, they are. What is the best way to learn now things easily? I believe the correct answer is computers. What are safe even if some don't agree. It wasn't phones... no, not television... oh yes computers! I see why you might think no, they should be outside, well let me tell you, cellphones and t.v. will keep them from that anyway. At least computers don't rot your brain. Well, I have done my part. I support computers, and their advancement. But it isn't up to me, is it? No, it's not. So please do your part by spreading the word. It's the right thing to do. You know that you want to!"""	5

"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1't you agree that computers should be limited or often not used? Recently, it has been brought to my attention that computers have a negative effect on society. Without a doubt, I firmly believe that computers should be a hobby not an addiction. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising and interacting with family and friends. Most teenagers are involved with cyber-bullying which takes place on computers. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising. I can remember when my step mom @PERSON1 was a size six in the waist. @PERSON1 would exercise everyday after work for two hours. This all changed when my dad bought her a lime green, @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 laptop for her birthday. @PERSON1 quickly became addicted to @CAPS3 (computer game) and began to cut down on her exercising routines. Six months later, when she went to a doctor's appointment she found out that she gained more than ten pounds. @PERSON1 is now a size fourteen in waist. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people gain weight because they cut down on exercising so they can have more computer time. Most people spend to much time on their computers and less time interacting with family and friends. This reminds me of my step dad @PERSON4. When @PERSON4 gets home from work he usually goes straight to the computer instead of having a conversation with the rest of the family. He gets angry when @PERSON2 (@NUM1 years old) bothers him because he wants to play. @PERSON4 is usually online. From three o'clock till ten o'clock playing chess with strangers from all over. What he doesn't know is that while he is building relationships with strangers he is breaking the bond between him and his loved ones. @PERCENT2 of teenagers are involved with cyber bullying. This reminds me of my cousin @PERSON3. Last @DATE1, @PERSON3 became a member of @CAPS4 @CAPS2, iTrouble quickly began to find her. In other words, girls from ages thirteen to twenty began to send her threatening messangers. No later than a day when @PERSON3 was walking down the street a gang of girls jumped her. However, she survived the brutal attack and deleted her @CAPS4 account. In conclusion, without a doubt, I firmly believe that people shouldn't spend to much time on computers. My three arguments are cyber-bullying, less exercise and less interaction with family and friends, @CAPS7 take my suggestion seriously and bann computers."	5

"Dear reader, @CAPS1, people have been debating whether or not computers are actually benefiting society, especially now that the majority of @CAPS2 now own one of these helpful machines. Computers help people with everyday tasks and are no doubt doing more good than harm. Imagine how impossible it would be for most people to do their jobs without them life would become much harder for the people living on this planet. Think of the successful schools in our country, and then think of which of those schools don't have computers. Computers are the easiest way to look up information, something important when children are learning. Whenever someone needs to know something, they just google it. This comes in handy when researching for that huge project due next week. People have never been so knowledgable. Computers are only important for school, but also in the work place. They serve almost the same environments. Now that computers are so common, people can conveniently type up a paper and submit it to their boss or teacher. It saves time and effort with a more professional result. Computers also serve the important purpose of communication using email or instant messaging, one could communicate with someone on the other side of the world without that enormous phonebill.Some @MONTH1 see this as dangerous because you could be chatting with a complete stranger. However, it is also opening your eyes to new cultures. Now it's possible to learn about life in @LOCATION1 first hand. If computers were no more, it would be extremely hard for a regular person to interact with someone from another country. It's almost like isolation from the world. There are many out there who take great interest in learning other languages. Better ways exist than sitting in a classroom listening to someone talk. As a person on this planet, do you really want to be kept separate from others just because they don't live close enough? A main concern about computers is that no one will want to read books and anything else. However, a recent study shows that after computers came out, more people have begun to read. This proves that just because there is now something fun and new, it doesn't mean everything else is trash. People will still continue to do things they always did, just with something new on their list. In addition, it is the option of everyone w/ other or not they want to spent their time on the computer. If someone doesn't like the idea, they've no right to take it away from someone else computers were created to help the human race not control it. If a person doesn't want one, they don't have to get one, everything is up to them, and that is the way it should remain. The next time you see a computer, don't think of it as some sort of obsession that's keeping people from doing other thinkgs they could be. But as a universal device that allows them to broaden their horizons and learn things they probably wouldn't go to the library to look for comuputers aren't holding anyone back, but pushing everyone forward, whether at work, school, or even the house, they benefit everyone, everywhere."	5

"Dear Local Newspaper, Spending too much time on the computer is never a good thing. Whether you are doing work or things for pleasure. I strongly believe this because being on the computer too long will mean that you are spending less time excersising, interacting with real family and friends rather than on the internet, and being on computer too long can ruin your vision. Nowadays with all the great advances in technology, peoples are always glued to computer screens. Lets face it, once you go on the computer, it can get pretty addicting with all of the fabulous things you can do and when we get addicted, we don't feel like doing other things like excersising. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of the kids who use his or her computer for more than @NUM1 hours a day is obese. The cause of this problem is obvious and it is kids being addicted to computers. Since they are so addicted to computers, the do not want to go to the gym or anything. Another example is that in school kids have a choice of what electives the want to take. Many kids would rather choose the computer programming class rather than physical education. This also cuts down on their excersise time. Computers are wonderful things, but when it starts affecting your health and physical fitness, they are enemies. Interacting with others on the computer can be looked at as a positive but it is not since it affects the way you interact in real life. For instance, some people develop a habit from only interacting through the computer that makes them anti-social in real life. Furthermore, some kids can be the most pleasant people to interact with through the computer but then when you used them in real life, they are the quietest people in the world. This happens because they are more comfortable interacting through the computer. Also, they have lost their abilities to interact in real life. Interacting through the computer is great if you have family and friends in other countries but you shouldn't do it so much that you become uncomfortable to interact in real life. Your eyes are one of the most important parts of your body besides the vital parts. Most people do not know this but being on the computer too long puts strain on your eyes which is bad. This strain only lead to unpleasant things. For example, if you we addicted to computers, then there is a large chance you will get glasses someday in your life. A recent poll was taken and over @PERCENT2 of people who use their computers for more than @NUM2 hours a day have gotten glasses. Another example is that overtime the strain build up and up to the where even with glasses you can hardly see. Imagine a world where your vision is so bad that it is like your eyes are almost closed, that's what happens to people who use their computers too long. Local newspaper, you @MONTH1 think that computers are one of the greatest inventions ever, the you are right, however you shouldn't use it too much."	5
713	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"In a fast-paced business world, breakthroughs in improving work opportunities and time has been continuously making the lives of people easier. Improvements in part-time jobs are one of the best innovations that companies are trying to use right now. Time that workers can spend at home or doing other important tasks has been greatly increased. That is why I agree that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. Part-time jobs, especially of this time, help college students to become independent. Sometimes, to be able to get into a good university, a student would have to pay exorbitant amounts (tuition fees, books, etc. ). There are even students who choose to stay in dormitories, which of course they also have to pay for. What part-time jobs do for them is give them a source of income to suffice these needs at the same time have time for studying. Moreover, it helps students get into these good universities even if their parents could not compensate for these expensive fees precisely because they have another source of income. Famous part-time jobs include working in a call centre. If you think about it, call-centres work 24-7. Students would be able to tailor-fit their schedules in college with their work in these types of businesses. This means that their work does not interfere with their college education, which in the future would bring them more success. More than that, this helps create the notion that you are an experienced employee in your resume. In conclusion, this helps college students in getting better opportunities in college. They would be able to maximize their time and income. That is why part-time jobs, in all respects, is important in giving students the best quality education out there."	5

"One evening, @CAPS1 I got home from school, I didn't know what I had for homework. I decided to call my friends cell phone, but instead I got her voicemail. I left her a voicemail and called her house phone instead, the same thing bad happened. Luckily, I had my other friends numbers I could use. The next day, I asked her why she didn't pick her cell and house phone. She told me ""I'm sorry, I guess I was to busy on the computer e-mailing other people."" @CAPS1 I think of people being on the computer too much, I think they don't get enought exercise, don't enjoy nature, and spend less time with family and friends. First @CAPS1 people spend too much time on the computer, they spend less time excersising. About @PERCENT1 of people do this and it's not healthy. @CAPS2 people do this too often, then they will not get enough excercise and without excersise then they won't be healthy @CAPS1 they get older. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS2 adults spend too much time on the computer, maybe @NUM1 hours a day or more while eating junk food like chips and soda, they are not setting a good example for their kids. @CAPS2 adults get into this bad habit, so will their kids and it's to early for kids to be unhealthy."" I also agree with @CAPS3 @PERSON1, she is right about how people spend too much time on the computer. Second, @CAPS1 people are on their computer, its like their face is glued to the screen and they don't care about nature, @CAPS1 people do this, I can't stand it. Its like they don't care about anything else. What I don't get is why can't they go outside and do something for at least a half hour, then go back to the computer and waste their time then? Going outside and enjoying nature is peaceful on a nice sunny clay. You could have a picnic, take a hike, or even hang out with friends instead of playing on the computer. I understand @CAPS2 its a bad day like @CAPS2 its snowing or a thunderstorm and you can't do anything outside, then you go on the computer. I think that at least @PERCENT2 of people would try this. Third, @CAPS2 people are too busy on the computer then they won't be able to hung out with friends or family. @CAPS2 your friends want to hang out with you and they want to go to the mall. But you can't because your on the computer, she would be furious at you. You picked the computer over your friends to go to the mall. There's probably a @PERCENT1 chance she won't ever talk to ou again. and I don't blame her. People who spend to much time on the computer, would barely understand whats going on. @CAPS2 someone tells you something, it goes in one ear and out the other. @CAPS1 people do this, its really dissappointing because you dont hang out as much as with your friends and family. As you can see, people are spending too much time on the computer than excersing, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. @CAPS2 you ask me, I don't play on the computer as much which is a good thing."	5

"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers are a part of our advanced technology. They have a positive effect on people because computers make almost everything easier, they can teach people things with tutorial or educational websites and @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and they keep people entertained in their spare time. Computers are becoming more and more advanced everyday and that's why I think people are so addicted to them, yet they do have positive affects. Computers make things a lot easier for a lot of people. If you really think about it, a lot of things that we use every day such as books, nice clothing, and music on the radio would not be here if it weren't for computers. We would have to hand write those books and hand sew our clothes. As for the music, we would just stomp our feet and clap our hands to make music. If ancient egyptians had computers, they would have built millions of @CAPS4. Our computers have programs like microsoft to help me do a major school assignment neatly. Computers have positive affects in this way. Everyday after I finish my homework and I go on the computer most adults think that all that us teenagers do on the computers are facebook and myspace. I do admit that I go on those websites, but if I notice that my grades are not in the best condition, I go on websites that can help me understand what I'm not getting. Ninety percent of the time that I do that my grades go up and I get a satisfying grade. I have also taught little cousins of mine how to add and subtract using the computer in pre-school. Computers are helping schools teach students. Besides education, computers can also keep us entertained with games such as virtual solitaire. When I go on the computer, I might need to research something that I have interest in. Maybe I might want to know when @LOCATION1 was invented or, if the universe ever stops. Maybe I don't want to watch @CAPS5 all day to keep me entertained. Computers will save me from bordom. When I use a computer, I am not addicted. In fact it has a very positive effect of me. Yes, I might stay up countless hours, talking to my friends on facebook, but to me that's a part of being a kid. The next day I might learn something in school that I want to search deeper into. That is what the computer is for. Without computers we would not have some of the knowledge we have @CAPS1. Their effect is the most positive effect on people, ever in my opinion."	5

"One girl sits by her computer doing homework. Another girl with her computer, talks to her friends. Those girls are doing activitys that make our world more productive. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers help people with hand-eye cordination, learn about faraway places, and talk with others online. This is what computers can do to help our socity become better. Firstly, the computer can teach us hand-eye cordination. By playing games , we can use what we learn in real life. A boy can play football on line, then take what he learned and use that in a real football game. Hand-eye cordination on the computer can help us to learn new things about our society. We could use what we learned to discover new things and help us to make the community, as a whole, . These skills can also help us do more things at once. Multitasking is a difficult task to and with hand-eye cordination and computers it becomes easier. A second productive task can help us with is learning . Some people dont know going on in The computer can direct us to news The computer is literally like one huge look of use . Another positive effect that computers have on people is communication. Many people have a twitter, facebook , myspce, etc. and all those websites can help . Products like skpe, video chat , aim and email allow people to have a conversation online. Email is something that there are so many new ides. You cannot only talk you can do business, send pictures, invitations, and announcements. Schools, offices, and companys all over the world use these products and it doesn't only make society better it makes the world better. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on people around the world. They can help with hand eye cordination, help you learn about far away places, and they help people communicate.

"@CAPS1 judgment comes from expirience, and expirience comes from bad judgement, qouted from my uncle's dad. Computers haven't been around all that long for the public, so the public has little experience. Therefore, the public also lacks @CAPS1 judgement in using computers and the detrimental effects are starting to show. Computers have caused damage to people! To begin with, computers can be a @CAPS2 issue for people. In studies in @LOCATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS3 who spend their time (@NUM3 or more hours) are wearing glasses. Because of bad @CAPS2 effects the screen has on your eyes. Furthermore, computer games are made to be addicting, which causes @CAPS3 to sit in front of the computer instead of excercising. This @MONTH1 be one of the biggest causes of obesity in @LOCATION2! My little brother used to be addicted to a flying game, and he sat in front of it for hours every day and started to get fat. As soon as he stopped playing it and going outside more he immediatly started to lose fat. Therefore, people need to move around more instead of sitting in front of the computer. To continue, my second argument is about detrimental effects computers have on the enviroment. First, computers need electricity to run. That electricity comes from power plants. Over @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's powerplants are coal, petroleum, or natural gas based. When people turn on the computer because they are bored, it wastes electricity that doesn't need to be used. Furthermore, scientists suspect humans are now a major cause of global warming. It is common sense that those powerplants burn their respective fuels to create electricity. In other words there is a definite connection between computers and global warming. Also, the powerplants release pollutants into the air that can eventually cause acid rain. To end with, my last argument is about people's skills. In a school survey, @CAPS3 who used their computers for more than @NUM4 hours per day didn't know how to cook or how to even light a match! There is a definite connection between the two as most people just put something in the microwave to eat to be able to go back to the computers as fast as possible. The matches are lit by parents to light fires or candles, But what happens when a natural disaster strikes like in @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION4? How will @CAPS3 be able to fend for themselves? The only way to cook would be with fire. There wouldn't be microwaves to cook canned food with. Furthermore, how would @CAPS3 be able to even start a fire without @CAPS4 how to light a match? Evidently excessive computer use could have very detrimental effects in a natural disaster, even to adults, so we need to stop it! Do you want @LOCATION2 to be thought of as @CAPS5 and @CAPS6? Should the enviroment, our only home, suffer because of a few bored people? How will we handle a major natural disaster? In conclusion, people are spending too much time on their computers, and they need to stop! People are becoming @CAPS6, @CAPS7 the environment, and losing important life skills. We need to all come together and cooperate to keep people healthy, to retain our life skills, but most importantly ssave our one and only beautiful @LOCATION5."	5
718	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"I agree with this statement. I think having a part-time job is important for college students. I have 2 reasons. Firstly, thanks to part-time job, students can earn money by themselves. For ordinary family, college fees are very expensive. And if students are living alone, much money is needed. So by doing a part-time job, they can help their family. Moreover, even for students in rich family, earning money is important because by using that money they can do many things. For example they can travel or study abroad. So in this meaning having a part-time job is beneficial for college students. Secondly, thanks to part-time job, students have social experiences which they never learn in school. For example, in food store or restaurant, they are taught manner and how to speak to customers politely. Such skills will be useful after they become working adults. Moreover they can learn how hard working is. It is said that in these days young people soon quit their job, but if they know about working before they graduate from college, they can endure even if their work is hard. Therefore I think that it is important for college student to have a part-time job."	5
719	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"  The intriguing topic at hand is whether smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends. Today, many people use smartphones in their daily life. Some people claim that using smartphones disturb communication among family and friends. It is understandable why they contend smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends. However, I claim that smartphones haven't destroyed communication among family and friends for the following three reasons. First of all, smartphones give common topics among family and friends. In general,  we can talk about smartphone games, social issues, and others. By using smartphones, we can easily access to these information and interesting things. If we play same games or have interests in common topics with family and friend, we can debate and consider together. We can communicate more with our family and friends by using smartphones. Second, smartphones increase the frequency of communicating with family and friends. Imagine you are far away from your family and friends. In the past, we could communicate with letters, calls. But now we can easily communicate by using smartphones. We can upload my daily life on kakaotalk family chatting room, video call to my friends, chat easily everywhere where wifi is available. So we can easily communicate through smartphones. This convenient makes us communicate more with family and friends. Finally, we can regulate using smartphones. If we want to communicate with family and friends, we just turn off smartphones and talk as usual. Smartphones don't force us to stop communication. Communication in real world is only up to us. Using smartphones give us more topics to talk, smartphones haven't destroyed communication among family and friends. To summarize, smartphones are the things that make us more communicate with our family and friends. Smartphones give interesting topics to talk. Also smartphones make us communicate more with our family. Smartphones don't disturb communication, we can regulate using smartphones. So I claim again that using smartphones haven't destroyed communication among family and friends. We use smartphones to communicate with family and friends."	5

"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 our nain forest growing back, service that takes only a few second, and being able to find practically any answer to any question. What could cause this phenominon. The answer is computers. These electronic wonder help us and our planet in some many ways. because they are ecofriendly, efficient, and loaded with information. You @MONTH1 be asking yourself how computers are ecofriendly. Well, for starters they help slow the waste of paper. Did you know that the @LOCATION1 kills aproximately @NUM1 million trees a year for book. Computers help prevent this in several way. For example instead of sending a short letter to the police cheif asking about what the new driving law is. You could send an email and save the paper. Also if you wanted the newspaper staff to interview the people that survived the power plant explotion you could send them all an e-mail with instructions to the surviers house insted of giving out maps individually. So now you see how ecofriendly computers are. My next reason was the eficentcy. My dell laptop @CAPS2 home takes about @NUM1 min to iload, @NUM3 sec to get on the internet, and @NUM4 sec to get to another webpage. So say that I want to know how many legs a centiped has (parents don't know either) without a computer it would take @NUM5 min to get to the library, @NUM6 min to find a parking spot, and @NUM4 min to find a book about cenipeeds. In total thats a least @NUM8 mins but my computer would only take @NUM1 min @NUM10 sec about. Also if you wanted to ask a friend what she is doing on @DATE1. I would only take a few seconds to send an email and she would answer quickly back, because she most likely on the computer a. My third reason was because computer are loaded with information, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 library I might find @NUM4 book on a sudject but on a computer I @MONTH1 find thousand. Once I was doing a report on monarch butterflys. @CAPS2 the @CAPS3 library I found @NUM12 books about them, On the internet I found @NUM13 wedsites on them! Also books have general information like just @CAPS5 life, but the internet has specific information the @CAPS5 part in the enviorment. As you now know computers help not only humans but the eviorments this is because they are ecofriendly, efficient, and loaded with information."	5
721	"Government: Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.        "	"Governments Need to Invest in Outer Space

Several people think that governments should not spend money on exploring outer space. However, governments should invest in exploring outer space including making another planet the colony and gathering resources. There are three apparent reasons why governments should do such works. First of all, the earth is a restricted planet. Even if there are enough resources that 7 billion people can use now, it will not be the case in the future. Futurists say that the population will keep growing. If it comes to be true, the lack of resources will call a disaster. In the movie; The Avengers, Thanos has a mission to eliminate 50% of the population since he saw how lack of resources called the disaster on his planet, Titan. If people do not invest in outer space, the story in the movie will come true. The next reason is the historical fact that humans had developed so far doing researches. Everyone blamed the person who invented cars. No one tried to use expensive and heavy cars while there are horses. However, the invention of the car changed the world. If people hesitate to invest in a larger area, it will be the end of human development history. Even if it is scary to invest money in a mystery place, it will return more than invested money. A number of people think that investing money in outer space is useless. However, this is not true. There are too many things that made life better since there was an investment in outer space. For example, GPS can be possible since there is 24 satellite in outer space. It might seem like investing billion dollars to rockets are insane. However, if there was no investment in a rocket, there will be no GPS and navigation that made a number of things possible including saving people with location tracking. In conclusion, there are obvious reasons why governments should invest in outer space: limited resources, to develop, and application. People have to see further to make humans great. If they only try to seek short happiness, the only thing that waits for them is a long depression."	5
722	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" I like KAIST students. They are so smart and briliant. But if I have something to change about them, I want to change their attitude. KAIST students tend to talk about something after they know about it well enough to show others. I think it is not so bad because it makes them more perfect. However, I think it would be better that they have some confidence even when they talk about somthing they are not used to. First, We can hear many thoughts than before. If only someone who has perfect knowledge and flawless opinion can give a talk about something, we can only hear from few people. For example, even if a student does not have certain opinion about school students' government policy, he or she can poll to someone. The fact that I'm not perfect doesn't mean my opinion does not matter. Second, the attitude is important when a student starts to go into a new field. Everyone is not used to that field at the first time. I think improvement goes faster when the person has many experiences in the part. And the best way to do is just doing it. If you're scared of stepping into the new field, you cannot go further. The attitude to be perfect stops students doinng new things. Third, expressing something without any confidence is very important in knowing myself. Our mind is not deterministic. It is not discrete. So I think KAIST students are often not used to express their minds just because they don't know about themselves well. But, trying to show their thoughts is very important to establish their emotion and thoughts. Doing so, students can see themselves more frequently, and it is the basic of knowing myself better. I want to change KAIST students' attitude to express their minds without any perfect confidence because everyone should be heard from others, it is important to go to a new field, and it is good in knowing myself. Today, how about reviewing your attitude? I want you to have such attitude."	5

They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear, editor of the @ORGANIZATION1. I beleive that computers are good for the future. The world has made many chenges with there technology. I know not spending time exercising is bad but learning about new things cant be that bad. If humans didn't have technology some of us wouldn't have heat or fresh water. We use computers in life. Computers are good for people who use them to learn about the world. Some people who have friends far away can use a computer to talk to them. Or even people who can't talk use computers to talk for them. The @ORGANIZATION2 uses computers to save lives. Computers save lifes in so many ways its scary to think if they were all gone we could all start dying. We use computers in hospitals if there weren't any computers the chances of finding a cure for something would take to long and the person could die. Lets say someone has what looks like a normal fever and you just say thats what they have. Two days later they died because they had some disease and no one knew until it was to late. We use computers to purify water. We use computers to keep us warm during winter. We even use computers in libraries why the library. Some people who have medical illnesses and can't talk have these little computers that can have something typed in them and it would say it. Most people use some kind of computer to talk, chat, and text. They might find it easier with a computer. The worlds a big place and many people don't know much about it. But if you go online you could find out stuff that you @MONTH1 never knew exsited of just plainly didn't know about it. Kids even use computers for school and school work. So many people rely on technology to get through there life. Computers even help people in school for people like me who broke there arm and have to take some test on the computer. Like me. Now so many things in the military, airforce, and @ORGANIZATION3 are computerized. The miltary uses thermal sights on guns and tanks so they can identify people in even the most craziest weather. It could even locate a wounded soldier. There even working with computers to make better bullet prove vest so they will be more lives saved in war. The airforce uses computers to talk to people on the ground so they could protect them. They now have planes that can be flown by a man far away and this would save there lives even if it gets shot down. This also alows them to see people hiding and they could tell the people on the ground to stay down or whatever. The @ORGANIZATION3 uses radar to see if there is any boats or submarines coming near them and the have a heads up if there would be an attack. We use this to help with other advances in the future we could soon have a computer that could help out people in far places like were there is a higher poverty rate. Computers save lives, alows communication, and is a good way for research. Computers is what we use to live we need them to survive."	5

"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it helps them learn about foreign places, it allows them to connect with family and friends that live far away, and it helps them with their jobs. Computers help people learn about foreign places. Before my uncle went to @LOCATION4, he wanted to learn about their culture. He went on the computer and researched @CAPS1 culture, so that he can be prepared. How would you feel if you went another country and knew nothing about it? What if you were to go to that country and do something that was disrespectful to their culture, but you didn't know because you didn't do research on it? I know I would feel bad. Now some people might say that you can read a book on that country, but not everyone has time to sit and read a book. Computers make the world a little smaller and helps us learn about each other. I think that's pretty positive. Don't you? People connect with each other through the computer. More than @PERCENT1 of people who move away from their family and friends reconnect with them through computers. Nowadays there are social networking sites, like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4, that gives people the chance to contact a family or friend that lives far away. When I moved to @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION2, I thought that I was never going to see my best friend again. But then, I got a @CAPS3 and found her on there. I was very estatic. We swapped numbers and addresses. Now everyday I talk to her on the computer. Also, the only way I talk to my aunty, who lives in @LOCATION3, is by the computer. I can't talk to her on the phone because that would run my phone bill up. Another reason that computers are positive is that is helps people find their biological parents or siblings. It brings them together and helps them reconnect with each other. Computers help people with their job. Anybody who is a @CAPS6 of a company has a laptop. It helps them store data, files, and important information. Computers are essential to these people. Also, it helps them keep track of their company if they go on a vacation. How would you feel if you owned a company and went on a vacation, but you couldn't keep track of it because you didn't have a computer. Computers have a positive effect on people because it helps learn about places, talk to their family, and keep track of their job."	5

"Dear editors of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 morning, my sister wakes me up to go to school. She uses her cell phone to set an alarm. A few years ago, my mom would come in and tell us it was time to get up. Now, we have one small device that we carry around with us to do our work. Most everyone has cellphone now, and it does much more than allow people to talk to one another from two different places. Now we can play games, go on the. These advances in the technology are making us very selfish. I, for one, do not approve. For starters, all of these new and improved gadgets are time consuming. With all the things to do in the world, we could all be doing something helpful, fun, or productive. Don't you agree? I mean, if you consider the idea that we all could be hitting the gym or studying for school tests and quizzes, then most teenagers would be in much better shape, physicly, and mentaly, @CAPS2. @PERSON1, my aunt an former physisist, said. The rate at which most students and kids grow increasingly more obese, @CAPS3 because of these new ideas involving phones and i-pods are completely sickening. The more time we spend using these items, the more we oppose the idea of being active? You can clearly see how we are growing less energetic, and much more careless of our time. Furthermore, the advances in today's society are pushing on the boundries at internet safety. Sure, people might claim that they can block out other people, but sometimes when someone posts something on the web, they don't always hide it well enough. They could have blackmailed one of your friend into commiting a crime, right? That happened to one of my cousins, @CAPS3 last year. The police took a long time to find her after she had been kidnapped, because the person who kidnapped her hid the evidence by a chain of blackmails. Do you see how important it is to spend less time on these silly computers? It sucks us into a virtual world that is sometimes 'bloody' or 'war-like? My brother learned swearing from the new & advanced game of @CAPS5. It's a fighting game (@CAPS6!) I implore your company to make the righty decision and write to help pull us off of our butts and get us up and going strong again. I hope you take my advice, and i thank you for your extremely valuable time and effort."	5
726	Why do you think people travel? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"Due to COVID-19, many colleges decided to go through the online courses rather than offline class. This decision is based on our safety, and I think this decision was inevitable to avoid and reduce infection of COVID-19. At the first time, all of us, of course professors too, were not common in use of online courses through ZOOM and website(KLMS). In my case, I was confused when I first used KLMS; and I think other people thought in the same way as I did. However, when I adapted in new online-course system and I began to feel free to use those services. And I could find some advantages of online-courses. There are 3 advantages that made me feel online courses are better than offline courses. First, students and professors can have some break time between the courses. In offline classes, after the class ends, students had to move on to different classroom to have another course. So they don't much time to do other things like going on restroom, or just rest. I think this takes about 10 minutes, and 10 minute is enough time to do other things. Compare to offline classes, online classses doesn't have to move classrooms between two courses. Instead, we can move on to the next course with just few clicks. This saves a lot of time, and students can do other productive activities like reviewing the lecture, or taking some rest, or going to the restroom. Second, taking online courses can make students more concentrate on lectures. The biggest advantage of online courses is that we can take lectures in our home. In my case, I feel comfortable at home rather than the classroom of college, and this helps me concentrate only on lectures. I think I could pay a lot of attention in lectures because it was online courses. Third, it can help professors improve there lectures. There are few professors who can not give lectures well when there are many students in front of them. However, not they can use pre-recorded lecture videos through online classes. I think pre-recorded videos can have better fluency in lecture than the offline-class. Pre-recorded videos are good because professors can use a lot of useful assistance like videos, powerpoints, etc. Thus, the above things are the advantages of taking online courses that I thought, and I think online-lecture is a good system."	5

A nice sunny day, sitting outside under a tree and reading one of your favorite books. Feeling the wind in your hair and taking in all that is going on in the story. You not only read at home but at school as well. Just think, what if you could not read that book because it was offensive to someone else in your school? How unfair it would to allow nobody to read that book just because of one person. This i could not imagine. At my school, teachers and other faculty are always encouarging kids my age to read more often. Most teenagers are always busy participating in after school events such as: band, playing a sport, theater, choir, ect. Not many teens are able to just be alone and read a good book, which is why I was so shocked when i heard about this strange news. Should books, magazines, ect., be removed from shelves if they are offensive? I do not think doing that would be a good decsion. Kids should be able to read what they want to read. As you probably know, not all kids are alike. Some enjoy things that others @MONTH1 not. For example, not all kids like to eat corn. This goes with reading as well. Not all kids like to read romantic or action books. I enjoy reading romantic and mystery novel. Some novels, more than others have a lot more graphic content such as @CAPS1. @CAPS1 has a lot of fighing in it. If a mother did not want her son to be exposed to fighting, should we take all @CAPS1 movies, books, and magazines out of our libraries? Another example would be the @CAPS3 series. Some parents do not want their children reading about vampires and werewolves. Should we not be able to borrow or rent this movies? I do not think so. Another reason I do not think that we should take out book and magazines in our libraries is, not everyone is offended by the same thing. For example, @ORGANIZATION2. Personally in my family, me and my brother believed in @LOCATION1 for many years. My cousins however, do not teach their children about @ORGANIZATION2. If I brought over @ORGANIZATION1 and read it to their kids and they got offended, should we get rid of @ORGANIZATION1? The answer is no. Some families have a tradition. Just because one family does not want their kids to know about @ORGANIZATION2 does not mean that eveyone should not be able to get the satisfaction of reading or seeing a movie about @ORGANIZATION2. So the final question is, should certain materials be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Can one person eliminate more than one book just because it offensive to them? I guess it all depends on your view of the situation. I do not think that offensive novels should be taken of the shelves because: kids should have a choice in what they want to read, not everyone is going to think that the same book if offensive and lastly because if we got rid of all the offensive books; what books would be left to read"	5
728	"If you could change one important aspect about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	" What do you think if you can learn subjects in Korea language at KAIST? The greatest characteristic of lecture in KAIST is that all classes are learned in English. By learning subjects in English, students can be global person and grow their English ability. However, I think it will be great if freshman can learn basic essential subjects such as Calculus, Physics, and Chemistry in Korean or their national language. Here are some reasons about why it is good to provide Korean lecture for freshman. First, it will help freshman to adjust to college well. Study at high school and college is different. At high school, teachers always take care of students. However, at college, professors just give lecture to students. Everything should be done by students own in college. So, students can't find their way of life and study. In this situation, learning subjects in English makes students more hard to adjust to college. It is not too late to study subjects in English later when they finish freshman year. Second, it can revise the start point of study for students equally. In KAIST, the rate of students who graduated from science high school is much higher than from regular high school. The subjects and class in science high school and regular high school is very different. For example, regular high school students hardly do experiment and they learn subjects that are recommended to learn by nation. But science high school students learn calculus, physics, chemistry in more deep to the point that are learned in the university when they are freshman. It is really hard to understand the essential subjects for students who graduated from regular high school, because they learn every subjects first and lectures are done in English. If the lectures of the essential subjects are done in Korean, it will help students from regular high school to adjust to the university. Moreover, it will help students to get interested in studying. After having hard time studying to enter KAIST when they were high school students, students don't want to study harder and want to enjoy the life of campus. In this situation, lecture done in English can interrupt students to get interested in studying. Serious problem like students don't study anything can be happen. In order not to this situation happen, giving lecture in Korea will help students to be interested in studying. For these reasons, it will be efficient to provide Korean lecture for freshmen. Students can adapt well to University life and students from regular high school can enjoy studying without losing self-esteem. It will be great to provide English lecture after freshman year when students well adapt to university lecture and know the way of studying for subjects in KAIST."	5

"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 newspaper, I firmly believe that computers do have a positive benefits on society. These advancements in technology can only enrich peoples lives. One way computer help is that students can do their school work online and see their teachers pages. Another great thing about computers is that whenever people need information or details on any place or things have can count on the internet to help them out. Most importantly they are a vital source of communication. People depend on computers for their scheduling and keeping in touch with everyone that they know. Without computers students would have it a lot worse. When a student forgets the homework, they can just go on their teachers online page and check what he assignment was for that night. Another thing that students benefit from are online textbooks. If a student can't manage to carry home @NUM1 pounds of books they can just use their textbook online. Nowadays, the internet is filled with lots of great information and educational site. Teacher also can allow students to research for projects online and participate in online educational activities. Not only do computer help out educationally' they are probably the must well known information centers. If people want to see about a restaurant, store or product, they can do that online. Also, many people want to go to destinations but do not know how to get there. The internet provides them with directions for them on how to reach their destination in a quick and efficient manner. An extremely important and helpful aspect of the internet is the ability of purchasing and ordering items online. Before someone decides to but something, they can find out all sorts of information about the product and shop around for the lowest price. People can even order groceries to new house if they are busy! I strongly think that the internet is the number one way of communication between people. For example, the team manager of my soccer team always emails me times and locations of the next game or practice. I would be lost and confused without these emails what I depend on. Buisnesses also heavily rely on the internet to keep in touch with their clients that keep them in buisness. The use of web confrences saves a lot of travel and it allows the company to be in buisness with all over the world. Above all, people depend heavily on social networking sites to keep intouch with friends, keep up to date on the news, and have fun talking to people. Without the internet, probably half of the world communications would be down and that would not be good. Computers, without do have positive effect on society. When it can be an educational resource it is very helpful. Also, it is the best information database known to and is probably the most used. Most importantly, wihout computer the world would be a mess without their main source of communications People know not to spend too much time inside and he always know when to go outside have some fun and get some fresh air. Therefore, computers have no negative effect on people and they remain an essential asset in everyday life."	5

Computers are a great source of information. They also allow you to talk to people, even if they are far away. They are also very convenient and easy to use, in mu opinion. Based on these positives, @CAPS3't you agree with my opinion? Computers are a great source of information. Unlike books, which you must find and buy, there is an enormous amount of information just a mouse click away! With computers, you can learn about far away places and people without having to visit or talk to them. Let me compare this to a book. Let's say you wanted to do research on @PERSON1. You would have to go to the library and search for a book about him. And what would you do if you couldn't find one about him? With a computers you could type ""@CAPS2 of @PERSON1"" into a search engine and receive of information in under a minute! I love saving time, and computers help me do that. They also augment the information I use. Another astounding development in computer technology is that you can talk to other, no matter where their location is. Email is extremely faster than writing a letter. having to pay to travel. Who @CAPS3't like that? Computers are very convenient. You can surf the internet, talk to people, and much more from the comfort of your bedroom. There are jobs that you can do from home on a computer. No need to go anywhere to work. My uncle is one of those people. He is s stockbroker, and operates his whole job from the computer in his house. It is a convenient and a well-paying job. I asked him what he thought of his job. He said, ""I love my job because I can work when I want to work, and from the comfort of my home."" @CAPS3't you want to have his job? I would most definately. In conclusion, computers are very beneficial to us. Did you know computers were first invented by @ORGANIZATION1 to perform calculations that were very long? Look at what they have involved into @DATE1. They bring us information at amazing speeds. They let us talk to people all over the world. They are very convenient.

We have stooped to the level of installing offensive materials in libraries where anyone can check them out. Being a daughter and teenager myself, I personally have had the experience of reading some of these offensive books and magazines. The sex, drugs, and violence used to create a story, have destroyed the minds of our youth. I strongly feel this disturing and destructive material should be removed from the shelves of libraries. I do not question whether children and teens should read, but rather what they read. I agree reading helps our youth learn and excel in schooling, but offensive books and magazines put nasty ideas into their minds and distort their way of thinking. The more our younger generation reads about these ugly things, the more curious they become. I feel they will eventually let curiousity get the better of them. Many would say that experiencing activities such as sex and drugs is all apart of growing up, but I disagree. Trying any one of these harmful activites portrayed in certain library materials could put you and your health in severe danger. It only takes one time to become pregnant or become addicted to drugs. To better prove my point, think of your favorite book. Did you look up to any of the main characters? Did you want to be just like him/her? Well it seems to me that this malicious material makes the main character and hero of the story a bad role model. They @MONTH1 save the world and be a hero by day, but authors and producers make sure they include their night life in the story as well. This tells our children that it is okay to do these things, when it is the exact opposite. I stand by my opinion and believe offensive books, magazines, and movies should be removed from the shelves of libraries. This material plants a bad seed in the mind of our youth. It leads them to believe everyone, including their heros in books and movies, does these things. Sex, violence, and drugs are not what this world was made for"	5
732	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"To achieve success in life, there are two ways: taking risks or chances and careful planning. Both methods have their pros and cons, but there is no way to return when the taking risk is ruined. Therefore, they can only achieve success in their life with careful planning. First of all, achieving success requires a sophisticated process. Achieving success takes a long time. Therefore, with careful planning, people do not lose their way. In other words, without careful planning, it is very hard to concentrate on their goals. If people want to achieve success, they need to plan carefully. In addition, people can not achieve success alone. In the process to achieve success, they need courage from families and friends. Therefore, they should explain how to achieve their success with accurate and careful planning. Through this, they can persuade families and friends, also at the same time they can remind their goal. It is a very important process to achieve success effectively. Some people might say that success in life comes from taking risks or chances, but it is not true. It is very hard, but if someone achieves success by taking risks they could not achieve success anymore. This is only a very short section, and taking risks to achieve success is very risky when you look at life as a whole. In other words, if taking risks but failed, people can not recover and stand up. Therefore, people should not get deceived by those who achieve success in life by taking risks, yet planning their way to achieve success. Every people want to achieve success in their life.

Computers are a source of vast knowledge from millions of sources. They have already caused exponential advancement. Overall, computers have a positive effect. on a rainy day, @NUM1 students will spend time on their computers. out of those students, @PERCENT1 will be on sites such as A.I.M. (@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3), @CAPS4, @CAPS5, or @ORGANIZATION2. Even if they can't use their phone or get out of the house, they can communicate with friends, old and new. Teens and adults use the @CAPS6 to talk in friends they haven't seen for up to @NUM2 years. People will talk to eachother more, building more relationships and better conversational skills. Over @NUM3 of the sites used by teens are based on @CAPS8 networking. To be able to easily have a conversation with someone miles away is a sign of tremendous advancement. @ORGANIZATION1 is a multi-million dollar company. @PERSON1, a for @ORGANIZATION1, says that sites like @ORGANIZATION1 have skyrocketed in popularity over the @DATE1. More and more people are putting down their @PERSON2 dictionary to type the word into @LOCATION1, where it is accompanied by a pronunciation and found more easily. Students use computers for information on school reports in @CAPS7, @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10, or @CAPS11. Information can be found in any subject. There was a survey taken to see which is used more often, books with a specific subject or computers for information or various subjects. Computers are used overwhelmingly more often. They're quicker than books and it's easier to search for a of resource an the @CAPS6. And say sight of particular interest or exceptionally usefull can be added to your favorites. Computers are more practical than books. Pictures of scientific laboratories where space shuttles are sent to the moon have @NUM4 main component computers. Adds from @ORGANIZATION3 show that they're computers are getting smaller and smaller. There's a laptop that will fit in an envelope and a handheld touch screen computer that can almost fit in your pocket. You can type papers and assignments so they're more ledgible. Computers can even score tests. Advancement is centered around computers. Before computers, so many things we do now would seem impossible. But computers open up a realm of possibilities. Typing is faster then hand-writing in some cases and papers can be saved electronically. If our country keeps advancing at the rate, than it is possible to have computers that do maindain chores such as taking out the trash or washing the dishes. There can be computers that talk bark to you like a real conversation. People can learn more and more information and personally advance in intelligence. I look at a computer and think of progress. There are points of computers that are not ideal, but overall, computers are benefitial to society. In a computer, you have access to friends old and new and information from millions of sources. Most of all, computers represent progress and advancement I see no direct harm from computers."	5
734	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Ultimately, restaurants are the place to offer food. They need to supply fresh food and clean hall to customer. Of course, people who visit a restaurant want to have dishes in pleasant surroundings. Imagine, when you are eating a delicious meal at a restaurant, smokers are smoking at the next table. Smoke is getting to spread in the air. You should be upset and lose your appetite. It is absolutely bad behavior to smoke in most of places where many people visit. Person who smokes in these areas lacks consideration for others and has no manner. They must know their fault and correct the deformed posture. A mature sense of citizenship helps to grow a high country level. However, it is better to prepare smoking sections for smokers in a lot of restaurant because smokers have a right to respect their liberty and personality. If smoking is prohibited in the restaurants by the law, lots of smokers cannot accept obediently. Anyway, I am sure that it is a serious social problem. We have to find out the best policy to satisfy both non-smokers and smokers."	5
735	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Smoking is bad for health. Smoking causes lung cancer. Smoking causes heart disease. Of course I know that. As if the hearty, overzealous anti-smoking campaigns weren't doing enough to curb this unhealthy habit, they insidiously wove this schtick into the curriculum. Case in point: Biology class in Secondary 2. We learned how tiny smoke particles bind irreversibly with red and white blood cells, and are carried throughout the body, effectively spreading the harmful substances all over our body. Please, if I ever need a poignant reminder of aforementioned harmful effects, I would just buy a pack and stare at the tasteful illustrations of gangrenous tissue ravaged by years and years of chain smoking. But wait, what is inside the box- holy sh*t! Aha, what a shame it would be to see these twenty perfectly new and viable cigarettes go to waste. You see, no one talks about the other side effect of smoking. You feel good. No, I correct myself, you feel bloody good. It was as if a low rumble of euphoria washed over your entire being, not unlike the high from alcohol, except slower. It is also a great tool for socialization. Imagine petty little deviants like me all congregating in those stupid yellow boxes, packed like sardines, puffing away. Yup, the government has made it illegal to smoke freely in public places, except for those tiny yellow boxes demarcated ""smoking corners"". What the f*ck. As if we have no rights to speak of. Oh wait, this is Singapore."	5

"In this modernized world computers are key. They offer many benefits that enclude communication, enterntainment, and an education. These benefits have positive effects on people throughout the world and are why I support the advances in technology. Communication is a large benifit with computers. Whether you are keeping in touch with friends or organizing business meetings computer offer a large amount of aid. With the modern technology that is provided with the computer, people can instantly send messages to co-workers or friends in a matter of seconds. In some cases businesses completly relie on the computer to function; for example, to have conversation with people accross the globe to discuss they are going to expand internationaly. Computers are greatly necessary for people to communicate and enable people to make plans with simply and effectively. The computer also supplies an endless source of entertainment. With the internet the computer provides the users with websites that enable them to talk to friends, watch videos, play games, and more. The computer provides a relaxing way to enjoy yourself when it is late at night or a rainy-day. The computer enables people to stay entertained, and relaxed when needed. The most important function of the computer is education. The computer supplies the user or student with a wide variety of information. The computer aids the user with vast information on every subject or topic that @MONTH1 be brought up in a class room. It comes to be very useful for research projects or even learning another language. The computer is a very beneficail when ti comes to education. The computer is a technology that has come to make daily life simple. It has come to be incorperated with almost any daily task that @MONTH1 occur during the day. It would be unjust to stop advancing in this technological wonder. The computer is a technology that greatly benifits our communication, our entertainment, and even our education."	5

"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 technology was grown exponetially during the last few years. The use of computers especially has sky-rocketed. However, I beleive this is not somthing to be excited about. The use of computers all the time can effect people's health, family and friends, and their apprciation of Nature. The ove useage of computers is a huge problem. Have you ever sat infront of a computer screen for hours on end? If so, you know the feeling of sleepiness and irritability. The lack of exercise while using a computer impacts people more than they realize. Excessive use of ocmputers has been linked to obesity and high blood pressure. the more people use the computer, the higher their blood pressure. Just sitting infront of a screen is terrible for people's bodies. To stay healty, only use the computer when it's absolutely neccesary. Going on all the time can seperate you from others. This g eneration, adolecents especailly, use the computer to comunicate with others more than actually talking to them. Communicateing only over the computer can draw them away from people socially. Not ot mention how fast rumors and secrets spread over the internet. Useing the computer can ruin relationships even those with family. Being neglegent of family by always being on the computer can draw people apart. Families can became a non-important thing. People can't pay atttention to their families while sucked into a computer screen. Computers are creating false substitutes for almost everthing, even nature. Humans started out living i nthe wild, gathering food from the land and giving back by raplanting. Our connection with nature was strong. We needed it to thrive. Nowadays, however, instead of listening to the sound of rain and the crinkling of dry leaves, people prefer high pitched artificial beeping and the classic ""You've got mail."" People do not appreciated nature as they used to, as they should. The beauty of nature is simply overlooked as if it's nothing special. Well, without it we wouldn't be alive. Life cannot exist with nothing to thrive off of. We can hop on our computers and look at pictures of nature on @ORGANIZATION1. com, or we can grab our shoes and see it for ourselves. No one can experience the greatness of nature while on the computer. No one can experience the feel of cool lake water sliding over their skin or a hot @DATE1 day while emailing a friend. It can't be done. Computers have robbed us of our ability to experience creature. In conclusion, computers are horrid for people. They can affect health, friends and family, and appreciation of nature. We must use computers only when neccesary in order to stay healthy. Instead of going online, get going outside."	5
738	Lifetstyle: Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.	"The Need for Taking Risks
    People experience various success and failures in life. Most people want to succeed in their goals; however, it does not always go the way that they think. Some argue that careful planning causes the success while others argue that success in life comes from taking risks and chances. In my opinion, taking risks is mendatory to success for several reasons. First of all, people have limitations in planning. Diverse factors determine the future. For example, a famous restaurant went bankrupt due to COVID 19. To be successful, people have to adapt to the changes in the world. Moreover, the adaption to the changes is important because people can not perfectly predict what will happen at any time. In addition to limitations in planning, taking risks is the beginning of the jackpot. For instance, thin potato chips are the result of failure. People who tried it at the time were asked why they made such an attempt, but now their work is a masterpiece. Ture success comes from spirit of challenging. Most masterpieces stem from spirit of challenging. Some argue that careful planning causes success without frustration; however, taking risks makes people mentally strong. People grow when they experience something. Although taking risks leads to failure, people can learn a lot from it. All of experiences are helpful when big choices are forced in the future. Achieving good results in such a big choice is the shortcut to success. To sum up, taking risks is mendatory to success for aforementioned reasons. Limitations in planning, beginning of the jackpot, and making people mentally strong could be the reasons. Taking risks is not always easy. Sometimes it may make people hard and frustrated. However, if people overcome it, they will face real success."	5
739	"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"All of the memories that I've shared with my friends over the years are marked by the expression of an emotion. Usually they include an abundance of laughter and happiness, just enjoying life and being teenagers. But on the other hand, sometimes these memories are tinged with sadness: day-to-day frustrations, vital playoff games that we've lost by small margins, or the passing of important people in our lives. I think that these highs and lows are remembered most in our minds because they are accompanied by things that are auditory (laughing and crying) and our brains recognize them as being more important than a typical day. As children we're very impressionable, so if something makes us extremely happy or unusually sad, it's going to have an effect on us and be remembered. I think it's known by everyone that teenagers aren't necessarily the most logical thinkers. Some people speculate that it is genetically programmed into our unborn brains that when we reach our teen years we will make a few silly decisions and possibly get into a small amount of trouble. I'll speak for my generation when I say that our actions aren't always completely thought out and sometimes we simply don't have a reason to explain the strange things that we do. For instance, my friend @PERSON1 has a peculiar and almost obsessive need to keep her car clean at all times. She washes it on multiple occasions throughout the month, and is convinced that driving slower helps to keep the dirt and debris from her mile-long gravel drive away from the candy-apple red paint on her @ORGANIZATION1. This wouldn't bother me, except that every day after school I go to her house along with our other friends, @CAPS1 and @PERSON2, to kill time before practice. The group is always anxious to get away from school because we're tired, hungry, and just want to get to her house and relax, but @PERSON1 never gives in to our persistent begging and is perfectly content to drive at turtle speed. One day, @PERSON2 became fed up and said that she could probably run faster than @PERSON1 was driving. @PERSON1 decided to take her up on the offer, stopped her car, and @PERSON2 proceeded to get out and jog down the driveway alongside the car. Soon she was a good distance ahead of us, dancing and skipping toward our destination. However, she soon changed her mind and since the car was going slow enough, she climbed on the hood and we continued driving, slowly. We were about two hundred feet from @LOCATION1's house, just one small bend before we'd be there, when @PERSON1 realized that if her grandparents, who live right next door, saw us, then she'd be in trouble. She didn't care to enlighten the rest of us with the details of her mental observation and suddenly stopped in the middle of the driveway. @PERSON2 slid off the hood, granted we were only going about eight miles an hour, and momentum pushed her forward at a trot. She slid on the gravel road, landed on her rear, skipped across the ground, and then stopped. Those of us who had remained in the car were in shock, our mouths agape, and we stared at her for the few seconds she remained sitting. She then stood up, turned to face us, and burst into hysteric laughter. We all let out a collective sigh and burst into hysterics as well, remaining in the same spot for a good five minutes. All of us were near tears and out of breath from laughing about the sight, we laughed randomly together throughout the rest of the day, and told all of our other friends about it. We had realized that it was a stupid thing to do, and @PERSON2 could have been hurt. But she wasn't, and so we all shared in the camaraderie of the moment. Laughter has that ability to connect people. It takes effort to make someone laugh, to spark the emotional trigger inside them that tells their brain, ""@CAPS2, I'm having fun."" @CAPS3 crying is a sign of extreme sadness, laughter is a sign of joy and elation, an indication of happiness. It shows that you're enjoying what you're doing and want those around you to recognize it. I really enjoy my memories that involve laughter, and when I think of those memories I always laugh again. I think that laughter is one of the rare simple joys in life. You don't have to spend money or drive somewhere, there's virtually no expense. It's timeless, simple, fun."	5
740	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"KAIST is a university one of the best engineering university in Korea. However, KAIST has two critical disadvantages, which would be told below paragraphs. If I could change one important thing about my university, I would establish a college of liberal arts, which can solve these critical disadvantages. First, KAIST students have a difficult in improving their insight. Most people of KAIST have similar childhood such as graduated science high school or gifted school, being interested in science and math from when they are young. Moreover, since their living pattern is also similar, they have a difficult in widening their insight. Therefore, if I establish a college of liberal arts, by communicating between engineering student and liberal arts student, they can improve their insight. Second, KAIST has a bias gender rate. It is also critical problem that KAIST has few female students. It gives bad influence not only to male students but also to female students. It is important to know how to deal with different gender people. However, most KAIST male students have a difficult to get enough skills for dealing with female. Female have also problem. They have few same gender friends who can share their difficulty. Thus, by establishing a college of liberal arts, KAIST can increase a rate of female students. In conclusion, KAIST has two critical disadvantages. First is KAIST students have a difficult in improving their insight. Second is KAIST has a bias gender rate. KAIST can solve these problems with one method. It is establishing a college of liberal arts."	5

"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 about what the world would be like without computers. Scary thought? I had the same reaction. A world without computers is a world of non-communicating people and no where to gather information independently. The benefits of having computers are that they are a way of communicating with friends and family that don't live in your area or that you just haven't talked to in a while. They also teach hand-eye coordination which is good for almost anything. Lastly, they give people the ability to learn about other things in the world. In conclusion, computers have outstanding effects on people. First of all, in my perspective, having a computer, allows me to communicate to people I've met on past vacations. I can email, them and talk to them on social networks such as facebook. This is benefical to anyone that has lost touch with friends or even family. Being able to talk to friends I haven't spoken to in a white, gives me and others the opportunity to catch up and reconnect. In conclusion, being able to communicate with others on a computer, is only I, of the many benefits a computer has! Second of all, not only does having a computer allow you to talk to others but it can teach you hand-eye coordination as well. Dereck was a channel @NUM1 news reporter, ""I can hit some far balls that take the cake for some of our games. I truely @CAPS1 it's because my mother teached me now to use a computer! ""@CAPS2 especially benefit from computers because they teach them hand-eye coordination which is great for those homeruns, or even touchdowns! Third of all computers allow students and many others to learn and look up things they don't know. @PERCENT1 of schools around the country benefit from having school computers for research. On the other hand, businessman, parents, and even teachers use the internet to learn about things around the world and to gather information to teach their classes. Overall, computers have many benefits such as they allow you to communicate with others, they teach you hand-eye coordination, and even allow you to learn about things and places around the world. As a whole, this intelligent invention of the computer is an incredible machine that seems to have all the answers and a success for realiable information!"	5

"Many college students have the wrong life pattern. They sleep late in the night and wake up late in the afternoon. If I can change my only one thing, I will change my life pattern like it for the folowing reasons. First, if I can wake up early in the mornig, I can eat breakfast. Beause I wake up late, I cannot eat breakfast, and I have no choice but to go to class hungry. Getting up early solves this problem. Second, I can do morning exercise. In the morning, I am still tired, but I can start my day refreshing by exercise. In addition, if I exercise early in the morning, I can exercise again at night. Third, I can save my money. If I stay up late at night, I have to relay on delivery because university restaurants are close. Delivery food is quite expensive, so I can save my money just by not eating it. Lastly, I can see the sunlight much more. When I sleep alte at night and wake up late in the afternoon, I can see the sunlight only in a short time of the day. More sunlight makes I feel better and healthier. Changing the life pattern looks easy, but it does not. Through this vacation, I will try to change my life pattern. I think it would be nice if you could join me. Thank you for reading."	5
743	What are the advantages of taking online courses in college? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion.	"As Internet has been developed, many schools are trying online courses lately. Some people said, “Online courses are not good.” However, online courses are highly advantageous to both students and professors. There are two specific reasons why online courses are advantageous step by step. The first reason is that optimal individual learning of students is possible. Repetition is the most important factor to learn something. Most of online courses are video lectures, so it’s possible to repeat infinitely unless students press the stop button. It’s impossible when lectures are offline course. Moreover, student could control speed of taking course. Each student has different learning speed, so it’s very nice merit for student. It could be a better method of education. Second, professor could improve quality of lecture. Professors could teach without missing details of lecture by video record. When professors lecture offline in traditional way, they are also people, so they might miss or forget details needed to be taught. Offline courses could prevent the situation effectively. Furthermore, Preview time is not necessary. Sometimes, professor preview old contents before starting lecture because those are necessary but most of students forget. Students could preview by online lecture easily before the class. In short, there are two specific reasons why online courses are advantageous to both students and professors. Online courses are trend of education over the world. Many universities try online courses, and they have great effect in learning. Let’s take the online course and learn more effectively together!"	5
744	"Government: Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.    "	"Advantages of Improving Public Transportation

Nowadays, transportation is important since most people live in cities that need vehicle to move far. Therefore, governments from various countries concern about spending money to improve roads and highways, or public transportation. In my opinion, improving public transportation is better than improving roads and highways for several reasons. First of all, improving public transportation is more environmental-friendly. Improving roads and highways would increase personal car drivers, which is one of the causes of pollution; on the other hand, improving public vehicles would make people to choose them rather than their own cars. To maintain clean environments with convenience, spending money to improve public transportation is the best way. Second, improving public transportation costs less than improving roads and highways. To improve roads and highways, the government need to find out less efficient roads, destroy them, and make new one; however, to improve public transportation, they just need to increase the number of them, or change the line of them. It need far less money and time for latter one, which means more economical. Some people may think that improving roads and highways would give more conveniences than public vehicles; although it would make people with their own cars more convenient at first, improving roads and highways would give people more traffics on the roads. According to research from KAIST, there was more accidents and traffic problems with wide roads(Jeon 32). On the other hand, lots of public transportation would distribute car drivers to them, and it will decrease traffic problems. To sum up, improving public transportation is more environmental-friendly, costs less, and gives more conveniences while going out. Since the governments should choose better one in the limited budget, improving public transportation would be the best choice for their citizens."	5

The computers we use in society do not harm us in any way! They are a huge step forward for mankind and only benefit our lives. They benefit us greatly for the following reasons: computers are a source of knowledge, computers can aid the advertizment and buissness of many workplaces, and they are a very helpful and easy way to communicate with someone across the street or across the ocean. Without a dabt computers do nothing but benefit the people of our society. First of all, computers are a big source of knowledge. Many people @MONTH1 want answers to a question they have encounterned recently but cannot find the answers in a book or newspaper so they turn to a computer and immediatley their problem is solved. Computers today hold every bit of information on every topic imaginable from history to politics. All one has to do is find a site such as @ORGANIZATION1, type there question, and millions of answers pop up assuring a solution to the problem. Computers can also provide a place to research for a project or statistics of the economy if needed by school, buisness, or just for recreation. Times are changing fast and the sources of the worlds history and school subjects can easily be found in the corner of the internet. What you @MONTH1 have looked for in books and papers can be easily found on internet at the click of a button. Clearly, computers are a huge source of knowledge for our society. Second of all, computers and the internet support many buisnesses in advertising and making profit. Every single time a visit to the internet occurs many different buisnesses are able to advertise their products and overall buisnesses with pop-ups, side bars and websites. It clearly helps the workplace get attention. Along with advertising products buisnesses can even sell their products online without doing a thing. This can also aid the consumer because they would not have to drive all the way down to the store and pick up what they need. All they need to do is select the items they wish to purchase and await for its arrival a few days later. Clearly, the computer and internet can help support the welfare of buisnesses. Finally, the computers we use today are a huge and easy way of communication. Contact with people from another street, town, state, country, can be established by the use of social networking sites such as, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3. You could send a letter with the touch of a button with out having to make a trip down to the post office and await a reply. An instant message, which can be used on any of the sites mentioned can also be achieved. This is where you could write something down in the computer, send it to anyone and receive a reply within seconds. Obviously, computers play a big role in the communication of one to another without a problem. In conclusion, it is clear computers benefit the society greatly without a side effect at all. Computers are a good source of knowledge, an aid to buisness, anda great way of communication. Everyone as agreed to this without hesitation so you should too. Computers are the best things that have ever happened to our society today."	5
746	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"There are different opinions regarding whether student take classes in many subjects or specialize in one subject. Regarding this issue, some people might say that student must study many subjects because it can make students much more powerful than study one subject. However, I believe that specializing in one subject is more efficient then study many subjects. First of all, if students specialize in one subject, they can do various experience. Compare time between students to specialize in one subject and take many subjects, it is clear that student who study one subject have many time. This make students have various chances. Student can participate exchange students and study at famous university in other country, or they can join company to learn how to apply their knowledge. This experiences make students better. Further, it is true that studying one subject is efficient because they can graduate earlier. People's age is very significant at competition. However, if student study many major, it is hard to graduate in 4 years. In KAIST many student study multiple major. However, many students who study multiple major graduate at 5 years. This is because they have to take other major classes. However, in other university, many students graduate in 4 years because they study one major. In fact, 1 year can make difference at competition because many company want young person. Therefore, specialize in one subject is more efficient then take classes in many subjects. Finally, some people might think that study many subjects must helpful to students because they can build their multi capacity. However, this is not true. For example, in Korea University, student must study another major to graduate. However, my friends in Korea University say that it is not efficient. He think that this politics make them can not focus on their own major. He always busy because he have to study two major course and he cannot understand perfectly because he don't have enough time to study. This example clearly shows that study many subjects is not efficient at all. In conclusion, students specialize in one subject are better than students take classes in many subjects because they have enough time to do other experience, they can graduate earlier, and studying many subjects is not efficient. For the three reasons mentioned above, I strongly believe that specializing one subject is much more efficient then studying many subjects."	5

               These days, many travelers have not visited foreign countries because of Covid 19. In my case, I like to travel somewhere with my families or friends. If Covid 19 would be disappeared, I wish I have the opportunity to go to a foreign country. Although all of the countries are wonderful, I believe that I want to visit America for three reasons. First of all, America is one of the greatest countries that have beautiful places in the world. I know that America has popular places like Grand Canyon and Status of Liberty. I want to visit all of them, and I will take lots of pictures. When I was 17, I vistited America with my high school friends. I traveled east of America, but I did not happy about I did not visit west of America. Therefore, I especially want to visit west of America. Second, I can learn a lot of academic things from America. There are a lot of famous universities like Harvard and Cambridge. I am a student of KAIST, and I will study and research academy widely. Though Korea has a lot of technology, but America has more strong power of technology than Korea. If I go to America and learn about that, I can develop my technology skills and grow up. Finally,  I want to make experiences that communicate with foreigners to use English. I learn English when I was in elementary school. However, I did not have the opportunity to communicate with English. It has the limits that I only study in Korea. I heard that I can upgrade my English speaking skills if I talk with foriegners many times. Becuase I hope I want to be a global leader, I want to practice English in America. America is the country that has a lot of advantages and a things that I have to learn. I want to visit America because I want to feel happiness, learn academy, and practice English. It is difficult to have the opportunity to visit a foreign country becuase of Covid 19, but if it is possible, I am sure that I will go to America first."	5

You don't know what the weather is like, you don't know what kinds of food they eat. You're not quite sure how to prepare for the trip. So you go online and learn everything and anything about @LOCATION1. You pack appropriatly, and you have a great time. All because you had a computor. Computers can help you get a better education, no matter what your age. It also gives you the ability to keep in touch with friends and family, and are necessary for many jobs. Computers help many people learn about different countries and cultures. We know so much more about other places now than we did before computers. But computers can teach you so much more than just different countries. They can teach a whole new language, or help you understand the science lesson better. There are many online colleges where you can learn the lessons online and on your own time which is good if your really busy. The internet is a great way to keep in touch with your friends and family. You can use email, instant messaging, video chatting, or you can make an account on websites like facebook or myspace. For example, my cousin is in the navy, he has been for @NUM1 years, and before I got a facebook, I had lost touch. Now I talk to him all the time. When most people hear computers, the first thing that pops into their head is ""internet"". But that's not all a computer is good for. Nowadays, many jobs use computers. Banks, @CAPS1, teachers, @CAPS2, even cashiers. Computers are no longer a luxury; they have become a necesity. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 jobs require a computer. Computers allow you to type up that book report, or make a very important letter look professional. Computers have changed the world; and once it's changed there's no going back. So, it looks like access to a computer made that trip to @LOCATION1 easier. Clearly, computers have become a part of every day life. You can keep in touch with your friends and use it for your job. But most importantly, you can learn so much!"	5
749	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"Many college students have experiences doing part-time jobs. Some of them even spend most of their leisure time doing part-time jobs. I think doing part-time jobs is really important for college students. By doing part-time jobs, students can learn what they can't get from school. For example, they broaden their field of visions by having more chances to get along with different people. Second, they learn to have sense of responsibility by taking charge of jobs. Third, they make friends with people from different places, which make their college time more interesting and substantial. Nevertheless, college students can't have a part-time job without concentrating on their studies. Although i think that having the experiences of part-time jobs is important, learning by studies is the most important thing for college students. If students spend most of their time doing a part-time job, they will miss the chance to enjoy campus life, and precious memories. To make matters worse, they may fail in examinations. To sum up, college students should first do their best on studies. Besides, they should participate in activities in school like clubs. Experiences of clubs are useful for improving abilities of leadership, and thus helpful for applying jobs after graduating. Only if they still have time, they can have a part-time job and enjoy their college life."	5
750	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"In my opinion, the importance for college students to have a part-time job varies from individual to individual. I agree that is it indeed important for college students to have a part-time job if they are financially in need or are needed to financially support their family due to unfortunate circumstances. For example, it is important for a college student who is financially strained to have a part-time job if he is able to cope with schoolwork and has time to commit himself to a part-time job. The salary he obtained although minimal would definitely lessen the burden of his family or provides him an additional income for his expenses. Additionally, the part time job could also serve as a meaningful experience for the person. However, I disagree that it is important for college students to work part-time if they are financially comfortable or if they are unable to cope with their schoolwork. In this case, the commitment to part-time work would be an added burden and not a bonus for them. Alternatively, they should use their spare time catching up on their work or using it on their hobbies or leisure since time would no longer be a luxury after they graduated. So as a whole, the importance for college students to have a part-time job really depends on the individual itself and there are not general rule to indicate whether having a job is crucial for that person or not."	5
751	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The three reasons I think this, is because computers enhance our hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find out information about a certain topic. They also allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. Computers, in fact, increase our hand-eye coordination. The usage of both the screen and the keyboard allow us to look only at tha sceen while typing on the keyboard. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill to have when excersising by playing sports or working out, which is also important and very good for our bodies. If you want in to apply for a job in, for example, an office, and you started stumbling and acting clumsy, then you @MONTH1 be looked at differently if you were organized and knew what your doing. This is why hand-eye coordination is important to people. Computers also have the amazing ability to search the world wide web. This gives us the ability to make millions of searches for any given topic. For example, In fifth grade I did a research project on @LOCATION2. Without all the useful information I found on the computer. I would have never been able to learn evrything I did. As most of the world already knows, there was a devestating earthquake in the small country of @LOCATION4. Computers was one of the ways that helped spread the word and get everyone to start helping and sending supplies and food to the victims. Also, if a family is thinking about going somewhere for a vacation, they can take care of most of the help on the computer. They could buy flight tickets, book a room at the hotel, and even get a rental car for when they land. This is what my family did on our vacation to @LOCATION1 and everything turned out perfectly all thanks to the computer and being able to do everything online. This is how the computer can help you research any topic. Lastly, you can use the computer to communicate with people that live far away and you rareley ever see. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION3, so I use video chat to talk to them since I only get the chance to see them one every two or three years. Also when my dad goes on buisness trips to other states or even something out of the country, we use instant messaging or video chat to keep in touch. Lastly, if you have friends or family who are fighting for america in @LOCATION5 right now, you can also use a video chat to communicate with them. So these are all my reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They help with hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find information on any topic through the internet, and lastly, the allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. These are my reasons and I hope you agree with me that computers have a positive effect on people today."	5
752	Government: Some people think that governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology. Other people disagree and think that this money should be spent on more basic needs. Which of these opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	"Nowadays, the importance of computer science is increasing rapidly since enterprises demands automation on workplaces. Not only companies, ordinary people also realize how computer is convinent and important on various area. Justly, computer science became a trend on scientific approach method. Enhancing computer science is one of competition events between nations, thus it is inevitable to spend money on computer technology. There are several reasons why goverments should invest considerable money on computer technology field: diversification of computer language, dominance of future quantum computers and its connection with other fields. Despite importance of computer technology, computer langauage is still complicated. To be familiar with computer, they must learn about computer languages and, by extension, to enhance computer technology, they should easily try on computer language. Portion of computer language developers devote to vary computer language to make more easy and intuitive. Goverments should invest developing easier computer langauge and construct big data using collective intelligence. Furthermore, investing on artificial intelligence which use the big data is also needed. Meanwhile, new computer science field, quantum computing, become popular topic. Most of physicists, computer scientists forecast that quantum computing will lead scientific community in the fourth industrial revolution era with its distictly fast computing speed. Goverments must invest on quantum computing field to prepare on next generation. Some claim that spending money on computer technology is less important than investing natural scientific fields; however, recent natural scientific fields have derivative field called, computational sicence. They simulate various natural situations, and because they requires huge amount of arithmetic operations, up-to-date CPU is essential. Enhancing computer technology is directly connected with enhancing natural science. Conseqeuntly, investing computer technology field is necessary because"	5

"Dear local newspaper, I have recently saw that you think that people are spending way too much time on computers instead of excercising or hanging with their friends and family. Well I think the opposite of that opinion. People interact with people online if the want to. People can also learn new things. Plus computers help people make money. So read on to hear more. Most people that use computers are interacting with people someway somehow. @PERCENT1 of all people have either a facebook, a myspace, a skype, or all three. on any of those sites you interact with people. We can meet new people on the internet. Like people on the other side of the state or country. Also we hear about what is going on in our big or small town. Like for instance if there was a missing child we know the description, so we could help find him or her. Not only do people interact bu people can research useful information. For an example, one day I was told do a project on teen mothers. I went straight to the library I took some books out and whatever I couldn't find in the books. I went to the computer for. Also we can learn about faraway places like @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1. My mom always says, ""@CAPS1 your room or @CAPS2 going to give your stuff to people in need."" @CAPS3 the first time she said that to me I went to the computer to see how other people were having to me. Some were good, nice, big houses but tyen others lived in boxes and trash cans. That changed me big time, I felt really had for those people. Lastly computers help people make money and support their family. @PERCENT2 of all people found out about their job on a computer. Theycan go to websites to find good safe jobs that makes good money. Plus if you have a computer you can easily work from home. Some people dont have the money for babysitters so have to watch their kids all day so have to work from home to make money. Finally people can apply for jobs or even community service online. My sister, @PERSON1, got her first job by going on the @CAPS4 museums website and applying right there on the computer. Therefore computers are good. I say this because people can interact with other people online, people can research useful information, and finally computers help people find jobs and make money. Do you use computers for any of these reasons?"	5

We need to get rid of this habbit and learn to do different activites! People are spending way to much time on computers and less time enjoying nature excersing, and need to interact with friends and family more take the time to agree with me as I confront you on how the computer is taking over our lives! Is time flying you by? Are you overwhelmed, at how life passes you so quickley? Well, if you answered yes, stop the computer madness and head on outside! Your no enjoying nature! Nature is as beautiful as a gorgeous scene of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 love oceans with pink sand.

"I Believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers are a relatively new invention, they have become very popular. Computers allo people to talk online with each other. They also allow students to complete homework assignments and important projects. Computers also allow people to store important files and pictures in places that won't get lost. Computers are helpful in so many ways, but these are just a few. Computers allow people online. whether @CAPS3's through email, instant messaging, or a video chat, computers peplace old and haved ways @ORGANIZATION1 communication. For example, instead @ORGANIZATION1 writing a letter to someone, mailinbg @CAPS3 to them, and having to wait two days for them to receive @CAPS3, email them! Obtain an email address, type a message, and click send. They will receive the message instantly, and even reply soon enough @PERSON1, president @ORGANIZATION1 the @ORGANIZATION1, says, ""Computers are an important part fo technology.

Instead @ORGANIZATION1 hand-writing that four-page essay on @PERSON2 @CAPS1 textbooks and use the internet for finding information. Computers also allow students to email teachers in case @ORGANIZATION1 missed classes and assignments. @CAPS4 @PERSON3, a student at @ORGANIZATION2 who had missed quite a few days @ORGANIZATION1 school, says, ""@CAPS2 I had to do was email my teachers, and they sent me @CAPS2 the homework assignment. I missed @CAPS3 was that easy."" @CAPS4's not the only one who agrees that computers are a big help. Millions @ORGANIZATION1 kids & adults agree.

Well, just save them to the computer, and they're there forever! @NUM1 out @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM2 people who store @CAPS2 their pictures in a computer agrees this is the best way to do @CAPS3.

756	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.	"Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? Yes, it should. Some smokers may feel that their freedom of smoking is limited, but smoking in public places especially in restaurants may give rise to some problems. It is widely accepted that smoking does harm to our health. Smoking can increase the possibility of catching some cancers. According to some international surveys, the number of people who died of cancers related to smoking is increasing rapidly over the years. What's more, smoking influences not only the health of smokers, but also the second-hand smokers'. The ban on smoking at all the restaurants can certainly reduce the effect of second-hand smoking. In this way, it is a quite reasonable rule that all the customers should obey. To ban smoking in restaurants can also help educate the teenagers. As we all know, the number of teenagers who smoke is rising rapidly. Instead of telling the children that it is not a good habit to smoke, the non-smoking signs in the restaurants can lead the children to recognize the dangers more easily. Of course, it is of great significance for a successful restaurant to keep a clean and comfortable atmosphere. The customers may feel uncomfortable and uneasy when exposed to the smoke in the restaurants. How can a restaurant provide a satisfactory service to its customers when the customers feel a sense of not being at home? After all, restaurants are public places to eat and enjoy ourselves, the smoke can easily affect the quality of a restaurants' service. Given these reasons, we can now draw a conclusion that the ban on smoking at all the restaurants is reasonable and necessary."	5
757	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"All over the world, university students have to choose between taking many subjects or specializing in on major. Some people argue that one major is more efficient because through that, university students can become a specialist of their major. Of course, this idea is true, but I regard that taking many subjects is more important based on the following reasons. First, by taking more courses, students can find their interest in those courses. Knowing what they want to study and research at once rarely happens because it is difficult for students to know their interests in subjects before they study those subjects. In KAIST, one of Korean university, runs a special freshman program, which is actually choosing a major after freshman semester. students can select and take lectures by themselves. Then, after their freshman year, they choose their majors based on their 1 year experiences. This methods can bring students chances to experience their future majors, and a better choice can be followed after. Second, these days, many researchers conduct studies which are mixed area research. For example, a bio-engineer studies species by using big data and AI technologies. Traditional biologists may study with biological or chemical processes; in contrast, current ones do so with other area's technologies. Therefore, considering the current research trends, it is good for students to learn various fields, and for universities to give students various courses in order to make competent researchers. In contrast to my side, many people still argue that there can be waste of time and resources during studying many courses. However, I still believe that large background knowledge is better than deep one. Taking many courses must be take times and energy, but this is not a waste, rather it is investment. Past experiences are the seed that will grow and give us achievement. In other words, sowing many seeds have more possibilities to make fruits. Thus, it is good to study various fields for future achievement. In conclusion, considering the factors above, it is easy to say that taking many courses has many benefits. Situation can be different person by person, but people in their age twenties are still young to take risks and challenge. In other words, spending times to look around various fields can not be a large risk in their life. Students still have to enjoy the chance to be bore ambitious."	5

"Computers, @CAPS1 how far we've come. Computers hold many opertunities for the world and… we don't use any of them. Computers have taken many and left them without excersize. Computers fasinate many and can become very adicting if not used only in moderation. Computers are also attention hogs and take away interaction with family. Imagine seven years of your life sitting in front of a computer. You never get up unless you absolutely need to. You even decide to cut the sports from your life. Now imagine what that does to your body. Even if you ate right, the never excersising part woudl kill you. I remember I was at my cousin @PERSON2's house when she sugested to play the game @CAPS2 fit. If you have never played this before, when you sign in, it does some tests and determines the age of your body. My body was @NUM1 years old. I was a @NUM2 years old in a @NUM1 year old body. All those years gone in front of the computer. I don't want that experience to happen to anouther. Don't make the same mistake as me readers of the @LOCATION1 current. I have a friend name @PERSON1, and she is a computer addict. She would spend days on end on the computer. Sometimes she'd miss school for the computer or come to school just to play on the computer. She'd sometimes get violent when someone tried to pull her away. I hated seeing my friend like this, but mostly I hated how I watched it happen. It started off innocent enough. She enjoyed a certain website on the internet. It would sometimes get scary when she talked to me about it and clearly had played it all night. If you are looking at this story and thinking that would never happen to me, your wrong. I was thinking the same way when I took a look at that website that got her started. Thankfully, I stoped my addiction before it got to serious, but many others like @PERSON1 could and will be absorbed by the computers. Many readers reading this right now, should understand how dangerous and read this is, ""@CAPS3!.... @CAPS3!... I'm talking to you!"" That is the sound of your family members trying to talk to you when your on the computer. It doesn't work, computers are so attention grabbing, you can't even stand to talk to your own family. My mom does this many times a day to grab my attention and ends up calling my cell phone or I.ming me. Thats really just sad. By doing this you also become detatched which is never a good thing. The more and more you ignore your family for the computer the less of a bond you'll have, the less of a life you'll have. Computers truly are amazing, but the loss of excersise is very unhealthy and rapidly happening. Computers can also be dangerous, many people will get addicted. The more you chat on chat room to strangers, the less you will talk to your family. Computers are the devils tools. They will most certainly destroy you, readers. Alway be careful, computers are not as they seem."	5

"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 a society we have come very for regarding advancements and inventions. One invention has made a large impact in the world and still ceases to amaze… it's the computer. This piece of technology has so many benefits and positive effects on people that without it, everyone would be stupefied. For exomple, this device allows people to keep in touch using a common social network. In addition, specially designed computers can tend to peoples specific needs. Furthermore, they allow you to expand your knowledge. Therefore computers have positive effects. Just think of all the people you've emailed or instant messaged in the past week... Your dad, while he was on his busness trip, your aunt and uncle who e-mailed you pictures of their new born baby, your friends from camp... The list can go on and on. Computers like @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 provide social networking like @CAPS4, i-chat, video chat and more so you can keep in touch with your family and friends. For example, in my life I use my @CAPS5 to video chat with my sister, @PERSON3, who is a freshman at college in @LOCATION1. It's our way of keeping in touch instead of not seeing her for months on end or having to pay for plane tickets every weekend to go down and see her. With the computer keeping in touch with people in different towns, states, or even hemispheres is a piece of cake. However, computers also provide surfaces for those with medical needs. If someone has just been rushed to the hospital for an emergency, computers will be used to monitor that person. @PERCENT1 of hospitals nationwide say that computers are on essential in their facilities. For example, when my grandfather, @PERSON2 was being cared for at the @CAPS6 hospital, computers were used to make sure his heart rate, oxygen levels, and blood pressure were all in check. And, if something was wrong. the computer would alert the doctors. Therefore, computers are also a huge help in the medical department @CAPS1 well. Lastly, computers can expand one's knowledge. There are thousands upon thousands of websites; all of which can teach people different things. For example if you are going on a trip to @LOCATION2 and wish to learn about their culture before you leave, you can just type it into your internet browser on your computer and bam! You're fully prepared for your vacation now because of your computer. Also, in my life, my teachers assign @CAPS1 research papers requiring us to find information on a topic. Perhaps going the library isn't an option, how are you going to acquire the information? The answer is simple, go on the internent! Internent research is the top way amongst all colleges and universities to research. I was recently assigned a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 project by my social studies teacher, @PERSON1 where we got to choose my topic of community service and research it. Every student in my class used the computer in some way, shape, or form for their project. Thus, computers can allow you to get information efficiently. In conclusion, computers provide an abundances of uses. Primary ones include the ability to exchange messages with friends and family, help in the medical field, and expansion of knowledge. Henceforth, I believe that computers serve @CAPS1 a positive advancement in technology and its effect on people are rather great."	5

"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, With computers being so popular right now it's easy to think that they are helpful and have a positive effect on the people that use them. However, I do do belive that computers have more harmful effects than good ones on the people they are used by. I belive this for @NUM1 reasons. One, they take away from spending time with real people, they make people get less excersis, and also they are very distracting and waste time. One reason why I don't think computers have a positive effect on people is that the time spent on the computer could be put to better use by doing things with family and friends. Now and day people are using social networking sites like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 to talk with people far away. People can spend hours communication with someone they will never meet and completly ignore the people who care for and love them. Also communication with people online can be dangerous because the person who you are messaging might not be who they say they are. Overall, setting out and actually spending time with real people creates memories that you will cherish for the rest of your life. This feeling can never occur through the internet. Another reason why I think that computers have a bad effect on their users is that constant computer use has resulted in a lack of excersise for many people. People who use computers for many hours are just sitting still. They aren't being active. The only movement that occurs while on a computer is the tiny flick of a finger as it clicks the mouse button. This is clearly not enough excersise that is required to maintain a healthy and happy lifestyle. Studies have shown that since the invention of computers young people especially have been gretting less and less physical activity. I'm sure that this will continue to get worse if people continue spending a majority of time on their computers. A third reason why I think computers are having a negative effect on people is because they are distracting and they waste time. An example of this is that once when I was online doing research for a school project, I saw an advertisment for a website that looked interesting. When I clicked on it I was brought to a site full of funny stories and pictures. I spent the next half an hour reading entries on that website and completely forgot about my project. When I relized what I had done I rushed to finish my research and ended up getting a poorer grade then. I'm sure I would have gotten if I had not been distracted other things to do on the computer. This is why I think computers do not have a good effect on the people who use them. They take away from spending time with family and friends, they result in less excercise. And they waste time and are distractions."	5

There are three main reasons as to why I feel 'offensive' pieces of writing, movies, and music should be allowed in public libraries. One reason as to why they should not is that people have been writing and expressing themselves throughout history; therefor, there are far too many pieces that we would have to get rid of in order to eliminate them all. The second reason is that people have different opinions as to what is 'offensive' and what is not. The third reason that will be elaborated on is that people will be exposed to whatever it is you try to hide, if not throught the art of music, movies, or books, then through the real world we live in. Throughout history, man kind has been writing things down to document experiences, events, and ideas that have happend throughout history. With those expierences come profanity, sexuality, death, and abundant amounts of situations that the public eye might consider 'offensice'. If you were to try and delete these pieces, one you would be destroying a big part of history, and two there are far too many books, movies, and music pieces that you would have to get rid of. In almost every form of art there is some remark to something negative. If you were to take them out, you would be left with very few, if any books. The second reason is that poeple have different opinions on what is bad, and what is not. For example, I was going on a band trip with all the other band students, and on the way there we put on a movie. We ended up having to turn off the movie, because one parent found it inappropriate. While that parent didn't like it, other parents were upset we turned it off, because they saw nothing wrong with it. The same rules apply with books and music. It all depends on personal views as to it being 'offensive' or not. The third reason is that poeple will expierence all of the things you are trying to hide. If you take it out of the library, one will hear about it on the news, on the radio, in a restraunt, in schools, just about anywhere they are. Taking out the pieces in the library, will be useless in the long run. For example, people want to take out a book called, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' because it uses the word 'nigger' in the story quite a few times. There are a lot of people that feel it is not appropriate enough to be taught in school. On top of that, they want to get rid of all the books that say 'nigger' and replace them with books that say 'slave' instead. In my opinion that would be a stupid thing to do, because it takes away the authentisity and effectiveness out of the book. In the book when they use the word it is very powerful and makes you think. If you replace it with 'slave' that statement or passage loses its power on its readers. In conclusion, I strongly feel that libraries should not have to take out the 'offensive' books, music, or movies. If it does happen, we would be deleting part of our history and knowledge. With that if we do it, how will we know what books to take out, if everyone has a different opinion on what is 'offensive' and what is not. Finally, should we do this, it will not solve anything. People in today's society will still be mean, still do sexual things, people will still use harsh language, and people will still expierence 'offensive' actions. That is the society we live in and poeple will have to accept that fact. That is why I feel that we need to keep all of the 'offensive' pieces we have, that way the people reading them might be ready for the real world once it hits them."	5
762	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"Yes it is important to have a part time job. A lot of people think that working while one is studying is tough work, that one's studies necessarily suffers. However, in my opinion I feel that having a part time job enriches one's life, not just in material terms, but in non-material terms. One takes away life's lessons, such as diligence, patience, team work and social skills. This benefits the person for the entirety of his life, and so it is always better to start early. College students are at the point of their lives where they are the most malleable in terms of their psychological outlook, so having them undergo some life lessons will definitely allow them to benefit for the rest of their life. The students also receive monetary benefits, which is always welcome, because tuition fees are always escalating, as with the cost of living and one's financial responsibility to support his/her aging parents. Therefore it is imperative that students, wherever possible and physically able-bodied, be able to contribute to the household income by working part time. One can also learn more skills on the job, and gain valuable contacts that can put him/her in good stead in future job hirings. In my opinion, some are born with a silver spoon, and will never work part time. These are people who will never gain an appreciation for life."	5
763	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @LOCATION1, I think computers are a great tool for everyone if they use it right. Here are my reasons why. First of all, I think computers are good because news travels quickly. Using the internet, world changing news can spread like wildfire and inform everyone in seconds. It is great for staying in the loop and reading about things you need to know. This reminds me of the time when a massive earth quake hit @LOCATION2 and traumatized its citizens. Within moments of the accidents, it was already circling the internet. This brought mass attention to @LOCATION2 which caused many people to donate and needed items. Secondly, the computer is also good for researching topics for school and common interest. If you need facts for a school project you can easily search what you need through the internet wide variety of search engines, you will be able to pin-point exactly what you are also look up things that interest you. If you have a favorite sports team, band, or are interested in a famous figure, you have tons of information on them at your disposal. You can do all of this within the privacy of your on home so you can remain as secret as a @ORGANIZATION1 agent. This reminds me of the time when are of my idols died. Within seconds of hearing the tragic news I was able to search the topic and get an endless uphoria of information regarding his death. Finally, you can chat with someone from around the world if you wanted to! Using social networking sites like facebook and myspace, you can connect with your friends and chat with them for hours on end. You can also enter chatrooms with people who share a common interest with you. Just like how I talk to people about a band we both love. I believe access to news, research, and staying in touch with your friends is without a doubt the best reasons to use a computer. What are you waiting for? Get one!"	5

"Dear Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. The invention of computers is the single most important event of the @DATE1. @PERSON1, a professor at @ORGANIZATION3 says that ""the invention of computers has led to hundreds even thousands of new discoveries. This week alone, @CAPS3 have discovered @NUM1 new drugs that could put an end to cancer."" A report in @ORGANIZATION1 stated that @PERCENT1 of fortune @NUM2 companies are run soley by computer programs. @ORGANIZATION1 also state that the other @PERCENT2 of fortune @NUM2 companies plan to switch to computer based operations by the end of @DATE2. For personal use, computers allow you to communicate with your fellow peers in order to work on school projects. Computers make life easier in general and can help with all life throws at you. First, computer teach hand-eye coordination and can improve reflexes and reaction time. Computer based video games can prepare you for real life tasks and challenges by improving your physical skills. Numerous flight simulators and driving simulators are available on the consumer market. In this day and age, flight schools require their students to complete hundreds of hours of flight simulators. Some driving schools even make their students learn to drive in a simulator before hitting the open road. Other games such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, require you to think on your feet and can improve your reflexes. This @CAPS2 maker you dodge bricks and can greatly improves reaction time as well. All of the programs available via the computer can help you with real life obstacles and make you think createvly. Next, computers allow you to learn about faraway places and people. This is espicially interesting because you can learn about a countries culture without actually going there. This oppurtunity allows you to imerse yourself in different cultures and religions and would make it easier to relate to people to in faraway lands. @CAPS4 once said ""@CAPS3 are afraid of only what is different than us, therefore, @CAPS3 have nothing to fear if nothing is different."" @CAPS4 meant that if @CAPS3 know about people and places different than use, @CAPS3 do not have to be afraid of anything. Computers allow us to see people all around the world an learn about them. Seeing different things enriches our life and can make us better people. Lastly, the invention of computers allows us to communicate with people from all around the world. With the invention of @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6, @CAPS3 can talk to friends that move out of town. @ORGANIZATION2 reported that of its @NUM4 million users, @NUM5 million users have friends that live in a different country. When I was @NUM6, my friend @PERSON2 move to @LOCATION1. @CAPS3 missed each other until I turned @NUM7 and @ORGANIZATION2 was invented. @CAPS3 were both online one day and I searched his name to see if he had an account. He did and @CAPS3 immeadiatly started video chatting on a weekly basis. Programs like @CAPS5 allow you to make new friends as well as reconnect with old friends. In short, the birth of computer has allowed for vast improvement in society as a whole. Individuals can talk with friends who live in different countries as if they were in the same room. Businessmen and women can have meetings on the computer with programs such as @CAPS8. Government officials can talk with other leaders from around the world. Despite some people that think the advent of computer has affected communication. I belive that it is an effective too that everybody should have access to."	5

"Dear @PERSON2, Have you ever noticed how different our society is today, even from just ten years ago? That's because of computers. Yes, it is true that computer give us advantages like messaging and information, but they also take away from some of the greater aspects of life: staying fit, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. Without those, life would be horribly unbeneficial. While surfing the web @MONTH1 be fun, it has been proven unhealthy. ""if a person was to spend more than two and a half hours on the computer every @TIME1 for about a month they would see a sudden increase in their gain. And if they kept the behavior up, they could gain up to one third their initial body weight until medical help was provided,"" say @PERSON3, a specialist in obesity at @ORGANIZATION1. Also, @PERCENT1 of all computer users snack while online, which only increases weight gain even more. Unfortunately those that spend alot of time on the computer are not usually okay with exercising either. Instead of outing down just a half an hour out of their computer time to play with the dog, take a jog, or try some aerobics, computer lovers usually just stay in front of the screen. That's too bad, because it causes health problems for them and maybe even the generations after them. Nature, is being ignored @CAPS1, more than ever. @PERSON1 can recall the time when the trails @CAPS2 runs were overrun with people. ""@CAPS1"" @CAPS2 says ""They're being overrun with woods and. Those are harder to act rid of that people."" But it's live, the trails and that to be fuller nature lovers are numbers. Because of today's new technologies, especially computers, the beauty of nature is being almost completely passed by. Some worry if it will fade entirely and instead of trying to maintain what's left, well just let it do so. Hopefully though, the next generation of people will reconize this horrible mistakes. Doctors, @CAPS3, all people alike are seeing more and more how computers affect family life. How often do you eat dinner with the whole family. When you don't, where are you most of the time? At the computer? That's what I thought. When computers and other technologies are available there is much less of a chance that you will actually interact with family and friends. mrs @PERSON4, an @NUM1 grade teacher in @LOCATION1, noticed that her family spent less time together than ever before when each family member got a laptop. @CAPS2 believes this is pulling her family apart. Do you? As you can conclude, computers have an awful influence, on society: people do not take, the time to stay fit, nature is being completely ignored, and Family interaction rates are poor. Whaat can we do to fix this problem? Just set a little time aside daily to observe these aspects of life. This way, life with computers will be beneficial after all."	5
766	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  People in my university usually take a class in English. This is a characterisitic of our school. Except for some professors, most professors use English, a universal language, for some foreign students is classes. In the case of English classses to improve listening, reading, and writing skills in English, it is more appropriate to teach in English. But, Is it really helpful to students using English in all class? My opinion is that it seems inconvenient to teach classes in English and communicate with students without any clear intention. So I want to change using only English in class. First, except for students who are very good at English, students have problems with communication. English is very different from Korean, so the intention of interpreting it in English and translating it into Korean may be different. Also, if we don’t listen carefully to the professor’s announcements properly, it is difficult to understand their intention. Like this, as we proceed with all the courses in English, we have more communication problems and study problems than we thought. Second, the goal of improving student’s English skills at the same time by conducting classes in English is changing. Students try to find an easy and simple translation books to understand their hard and difficult major books written in English. Also, students tent to avoid problems which they are faced while carrying out tasks that should be carried out in English. they can use a translator for convenience, although they have to improve their thinking skills. Like this, students want to pursue convenience rather than improve their English skills. In conclusion, by using English in the all of the classes, there are many problem which students may face. Stuents can have communication problems and studing problem which can cause because of an incomprehensible major term. Also, the goal of getting students to study English is turning into a bad point. However, if we do not use English, additional measures such as posting additional notices in English will be necessary for foreign students because English is their own language. Through these methods, we need to change the way our school teaches English unconditionally."	5
767	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.

Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Can literature, which is the basis of civilization, be censored? Can you take these ideas away from those who wish to think them? I think not, for it would be a futile endeavor to even attempt. To keep something as important as written word away from the culture of the people, would be one of the highest crimes against humanity and could not rightly be condoned, in my mind. Not only would this attempt be a futile (for the people know ways to extract information) it would be downright idiotic of the 'administration' to do so. I will concede that there are explicit materials out there that are not suitable for children or even adolescents, but that is where the parent should step in by setting guidelines and positive examples which their children feel the need to follow. Not feel that they 'have' to, but feel that they 'need' to. If parents cannot take control and decide what is appropriate for their children, then in my mind, they are not doing their first and foremost job as a parent that is to protect the child. Some @MONTH1 say that the censorship of culture is protecting the children, but I say that this is not so. I believe censorship is a lousy excuse so that parents and upper government officials have to do less work. If every piece of written, filmed, or recorded work, that was offensve only one person, was thrown out on that basis, there would be none. There has never been a piece of literature, film, or music that has not offended someone in some way, whether it be spiritually, ethnically, or morally. The fact is that people cannot exist without strife and misery, and whatever people can do to cause that strife and misery, they will. People find all sorts of ways to do it, whether it be war, discrimination, media, or just downright obstinance, they will find a way to offend their selected party. I personally am appalled at the aspect of censorship, for if a person cannot speak his mind, then is he more than a mindless homunculi? Created and controlled by the government surrounding him. Made their slave through ignorance. If in a society I  cannot say what I need to say then I do not wish to live in that society, for it is nothing but a horrible image of civilization. In short I do not believe that libraries should be censored, rather that parents should pay more attention to their children and dependents. If a person is offended by a certain thing, then it is their absolute right to not take part in whatever it @MONTH1 be, but these afflicted peoples have absolutely NO right to say what I @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not read! If this offends anyone, then I apologize, but at least you knew enough (through your education by media) to be offended and not just another mindless sheep"	5
768	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"These days, a lot of students have part-time jobs. On the Internet and newspapers, many companies are looking for students to work for them. I don't think, however, it is a good idea for students to work part-time while they are going to school. I also don't think it is necessary, because parents support them and pay for their expenses. In addition, having jobs has some negative effects. First of all, education is difficult and complex. To learn and get good grades, students have to study hard. They have to get up early to attend classes, and do their homework at home. It seems to be easy, but it is busy and hard. If students are working part-time after class, they are going to be tired, so it impacts on the next day. It will have negative effects on studying: they won't concentrate, and they will even be able to doze in class. Finally, it will impact on their grades. Finally, if a student works part-time, he may miss out on the fun of his life. He won't be able to play with his friends and enjoy his own spare time. In other words, if a student spends time on working, he can't enjoy his life. I think that a period of students is the freest time except studying. This is because their parents pay for their expenses, and parents help everything that they want. Therefore, students have to concentrate on studying. In conclusion, students' duty is studying. They have to study rather than work because having part-time jobs has some negative effects as above. A period of students is a favorable time to study."	5
769	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  School cafeteria is very important part of the university. The reason is that almost all students and employees use the school cafeteria for their lunch and dinner. It should not be too expensive and it should use good ingredients. I think our cafeteria is doing well on this so a lot of KAIST students satisfy with our cafeteria. However, I want to change some part of our cafeteria if I can. First of all, almost all cafeterias except for few cafeterias close on weekend. However, a lot of students stay at school on weekend. Therefore, students are not able to choose the menu at cafeteria. If they don't like the menu of cafeteria, they should go to the outside which is much far from dormitory compare to the cafeteria. It takes long time and it is expensive. For these reasons, I want the cafeteria to open on weekend. Second, For some dormitory, it is so far to go to the cafeteria. For instance, I live in Mir hall which is located in the west of the KAIST. Since there is a small mountain between our dormitory and cafeteria in west, I should walk for a long time to go there. If I go there by walk, it will take about 25 minutes to get there. Therefore, I want to make the path that takes shorter time to reach the cafeteria in west. In conclusion, If I could change one important thing about my university, I will change some part of our cafeteria. I will change the cafeteria to open in weekend and to make new path for the students who live in the dormitory that is far from cafeteria. If our cafeteria is changed to this way, I will be happy to go to the cafeteria in KAIST."	5

Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"There are many reasons why censorship can be thought of as a good thing, or a bad thing. I am against censorship. My reasons are that just because someting is there that you don't like, doesn't mean that you have to look at it or use it. There are plenty of people that would like to have access to that information or entertainment. Another reason is, that if there's something that someone doesn't  want their child looking at, then they should either trust that their child won't look at it, or prevent them from seeing it. Finally, what would be left if everyone were to remove somthing that they took offense to? Nothing would be left to read, listen to or watch. First, why I think censorship is wrong, is that the people that take offense to what they want removed, don't have to look at whats offensive. No one is forcing them to look at it or use it. They're better off just ignoring it. Because other people, that don't take offense to it, have the right to look at or use it. The library might be the only place that someone could have access to that sort of material. So if someone were to remove that material, the person that needs or wants it, would not have the access to use it. And they are given the right to use it. Their child might even have the right to it. Second is that some people wouldn't want their child seeing those things. But removing it shouldn't be that persons first instinct. I believe that the parent should be able to trust their own child not to look at it. And if they can't, then they need to somehow prevent their child from viewing it; not by removing it. The parent should be able to come up with a reasonable way of preventing their child from viewing things that they don't want the child viewing, rather than taking that thing away from the child, and the whole community. Lastly, let's say that in a library, theres at least one book to each person in a community that offends that person. If they were each given the right to remove the book that offended them, what would be left to read? Absolutely nothing. And each of those people that removed a book, most likely would enjoy another book that someone thought was offensive. So now there isn't a single book for that person to read, just because everyone else disliked the books they didn't think were offensive. Once someone starts removing, other people will join in, and you'd be left with an empty library. Thats what I think about cencorship. It's really just wrong. Personally, I would like to be able to go to my library and pick out a good book. And I know other people like to do that too. So why should anyone else be able to take that away from them"	5

The benefits of our computers are they connect us, the spread news, and they make every day objects work. Computers connect us in so many difffrent ways. Where would businesses be without computers? Most modern day businesses are run by computers. Owners can now have businesses all over the world. With computers a business in @LOCATION2 or somewhere else in @LOCATION4 can be connected with a building in @LOCATION1. They can have live video chats together. With the help of the computers they are able to contact any branch of their business all over the world. Even smaller businesses use the computer to connect to customers. Now a days we do a lot of online shopping. This is an example of how stores connect to their customers. Stores can show buyers everything they have to offer including store locations. This can help stores get more business by connecting the buyer to the shop. The computer not only connects stores and businesses but also people to people. @PERCENT1 of kids in my school own a computer. With all these computers many social networking sites are born. The most popular right now is @CAPS1. Students can connect to old friends from other places and even other countries. We have a live chat on @CAPS1 or even @CAPS2. @CAPS2 is instant messging which is, well, instant. With a simple click people are connected no matter how far apart they are. Therefore, computers conect people. Computers also broadcast news. Without the computers most of us would not no about world news. This includes the @LOCATION3 earthquake. If we did not have the computers to let us know about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 they would be in alot more trouble. They would not have all of these donations. Also computers even broadcast national news. Almost all newspapers are now online along with on paper too. Anyday now they will be completly online. This will drastically change how we learn about news. It would just be a click away. What would have taken days to get here now takes minutes or maybe even seconds. Science also benefits from computers. Phones now can be personal tws, inernet, and messaging devises. Phones are just a tiny version of a computer. Cars also have computers put into them. The @CAPS3 in our cars are computers; we would be lost without them. Also, in cars there are computers to run just about everything else. So, there is not a day where we do not incounter computers. In conclusion, computers benefit us in so many ways. They conect us deliver news, and are in almost all of our technology. Could you imagine life without computers?"	5
772	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"KAIST recommends English 100% lecture for major subject. I think major subject should be Korean lecture because 100% English lecture has many weakness. Using Korean in major lecture can make higher performance than using only Enlgish. First, only using English for major subject can deprive uniqueness from students. Because  we have to follow international trend, English is very important language in world. However, science need steadiness and uniqueness for research. For example, some people in Japan got Nobel prize, even though they never been to other country. Therefore, studying in Korean would improve uniqueness in academic research. Second, most Korean students have lower performance while adapting to English lecture. Most of major subject are difficult to understand, and English lecture for major subject is much more difficult for students. According to survey, more than 50% of university students think that English lecture in major subject has poor opportunity to discuss. Thus, allowing to teach major subject in Korean will activate discussion in class, and this will improve academic performance of students. To sum up, English lecture for all major subjects is not benecal because it deprives uniqueness from students. In addition, teaching major subject in Korean wiil raise academic performance of Korean students. For this reason, KAIST should add some major lecture in Korean."	5

"Picture for yourself you, as a @NUM1 year old child sitting in front of one of the greatest philosophers of history, @LOCATION1. Days later, you come to find out that he has been killed for 'corrupting the minds of the children.' @CAPS1 what? One of the greatest minds in human history has been censored because they didn't like his ideas. This is censorship at a basic level, and it happens to millions of books, movies, and songs every day. Censorship is not only wrong, its unnecessary. Here's why. @CAPS1, when it comes down to it, most books, movies, and songs are meant to be interpreted in many different ways. For example, some poems are written with a vague tone so that they can be interpreted in different ways based upon the person. Besides, most music and books are meant to entertain, not offend. Granted, some books are meant to be interpreted in a certain way, but that still doesn't mean that they were meant to offend. Think about it next to you look at a copy of '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' by @PERSON1; is it really that offensive to you? When you are given a book in school for a class assignment, they usually expect you to read it because its of some educational value to you. Books like 'To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5' provide a huge educational value because they show what @CAPS6 culture was like, but everyday, someone new is trying to get it off the shelves of every school library in @LOCATION2 because they find it offensive. Ask yourself, is it right? The answer for me is no, since books like that hold an educational value that outweighs their offensiveness. There's one last thing you must understand, and that is the fact that no matter how many books you take off the shelves, and no matter how many movies you ban, or how many songs you take away from us, the problem still isn't solved, its just been suppressed enough for different problems to arise, and those problem are that there are people who wanted to read this book @CAPS1 can't because you thought it was offensive. @CAPS1 this person complains to whomever banned this form of literature, and the book or other form of literature is put back on the shelves. @CAPS1 you feel it right to try and ban it again, but what does that solve? Nothing. Even if someone doesn't unban it, people can still teach and tell of what its about, making the ban worthless. I hope that before you think about complaining about some book you found offensive, you think about this. Your complaint that causes the banning affects everyone. It affects a teacher's ability to teach, and a student's ability to learn. Is it really right of you to take away a good teaching material? Or you could ask yourself, what does it really solve?

Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Libraries are filled with books, magazines, music, movies, and many more materials. All of the materials cover a really wide range of topics. For example, movies can be a comedy, mystery, or adventure. However, some of this material is not suitable for some viewers and can be very offensive to them. For this reason, these offensive materials should be removed from libraries. One reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because it can lead to violence in teenagers. If a teenager is continually reading books or watching movies that have violence in them, then they might think violent behavior is all right. They might not know that violence is not the answer to many problems, and they will not realize that there are other solutions to a problem. One case that proves seeing offensive material can lead to violence occurred in a high school. A straight-A student got a grade she thought she did not deserve from a teacher. This student then painted her face white, put on red lipstick, and took a knife to the teacher's classroom during school. She then proceded to threaten to kill the teacher. She got the idea from the movie '@CAPS1', and her costume resembled the @CAPS2. Some students in the classroom at the time called @NUM1, and the police officers convinced the girl to put down the knife. Maybe if she had not seen the movie she would not have threatened to kill her teacher. Another reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because the material is sometimes inappropriate for younger children. The children might just be looking at books and magazines in the library and not even check it out. This way no one will know that they read it. Some of the books in libraries have subjects like sex and drugs in them. When the child reads this, he might want to do everything that is in the book. I have  read a book that contains sex and drugs. The book might put awful ideas into the child's head if he read it. After all is said and done, offensive material should be removed from libraries. The material can lead to violent acts in people, even if it does not seem like that kind of behavior could possibly come out of that person. The material can also be inappropriate for younger children. All in all, material in libraries can be offensive to some people."	5

Everyone-- teachers, students, parents, school board members, community leaders-- had something to say about the topic at hand. This topic was censorship. A high schooler's parents were outraged that their daughter had read The @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 in class. In these parents' opinion, the rape scene in the book was far too disturbing for their precious daughter. While this seemed a fair stance to take, the parents then took things a step further. They sought to ban the book in the schools in our township, wanting to spare all other children the experience of being exposed to @CAPS1 was clearly traumatic material. This crusade of theirs posed the questions '@CAPS1 can and should be censored? And when?'. As the debate continued, I myself begin to ponder the subject. Who had the right to tell me @CAPS1 I could read? Or listen to? Or watch? The answer I came to was 'no one'. No one has the right to censor anyone else. This comes with one exception: parents and children. Parents have the responsibility to monitor their children. They must use their best judgement to decide @CAPS1 their children are old enough and mature enough to hear, see, or read. This was true in the censorship of @ORGANIZATION1, as well. No one fought back against the family because they did not want their own child to read the novel; it was only once they tried to keep others from the book that the problem arose. This is why libraries should not remove materials from their shelves because they are, in the eyes of some, offensive materials. Music you love @MONTH1 be offensive to me. Books your @CAPS2 teacher assigned @MONTH1 not be appropriate for five year olds. Your friends @MONTH1 be offended by your favorite movie or @CAPS3 show. These feelings are subjective; almost nothing is universally offensive or universally appropriate. We must, as a society, be able to accept this. We learn throguh @CAPS1 we see, @CAPS1 we hear, and @CAPS1 we read. These experiences teach us @CAPS1 to do, as well as teach us @CAPS1 not to do. Because of this, it would be unfair for materials to be removed from libraries based on solely opinions. To do that would be to steal from community members their chance to learn. Parents have the right to censor @CAPS1 their children see, hear, and read, but even this censorship must be done carefully in order to not hinder the child's ability to learn. We must not hinder our children's ability to learn from the mistakes of book and movie characters, singers, comedians, and artists. If we do take away that ability, we are setting these future adults up for making mistakes that could have been prevented by allowing them the chance to learn. Removing materials from the shelves of libraries based solely on opinions is not only damaging to our society, but, ultimately, it is dangerous to the people we wish to protect"	5

"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and I am a @ORGANIZATION1 citizen. I believe that computers do NOT benefit society of all! In @CAPS1 opinion, they make our town worse. People spend way too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. All of these things are @CAPS3 computers are doing to our society and it's time to make a stop to it! First of all, people are on the computer way too much. Teens are on social networking sites, adults are on chatrooms, and kids are playing computer games. Instead of that, people should be playing outside, or going for a walk in the park. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of adults are overweight? If people cut back the amount of time indoors, we could probably bring that number way down. Also, who knows @CAPS3 teens are doing on the computer. Computers have good things but they can also be bad. For example, chatrooms who knows @CAPS3 kind of people are in chatrooms. Children need to be careful about @CAPS3 they say or show on the internet. Instead of playing games or talking to their boyfriends and girlfriends, teens should go outside and exercise. Second, more citizens need to enjoy nature and the beautiful senery around them. Were all so busy running to check our e-mail, we don't notice @CAPS3 a beautiful day it is outside. On a nice @DATE1 or @DATE2 day, people should take this kids to a local park or pond. This reminds me of last @DATE2 when I went to @CAPS1 cousins house. @CAPS1 aunt only allowed us to watch one hour as a day, that included the computer. We were outside every single day, even if we were just staring into the clouds. This kept us active and enjoy the environment. @CAPS1 last reason why computers are badly affecting society is that computers take time away from interacting with family and friends. I know @CAPS3 your thinking, when your on the computer you are talking to family and friends, but it isn't the same. Instead of instant messaging call them. Maybe even invite them our to talk face to face. That reminds me of @CAPS1 sister. When I get home, she will normally be on @CAPS2. Now, instead of getting up and coming to talk to me she will text me ""@CAPS3's up?"" or ""@CAPS4 was your day?"" Computers help people communicate, but they also take communication away. As you can see, I have given you three reasons why I strongly believe computers are badly @ORGANIZATION1. Not only @ORGANIZATION1 but everywhere! You need to open your eyes and understand that people spend way too much time on computers, they allow people to not enjoy nature, or interact with their families. Please I'm asking you to understand that our society will crash it we don't fix this issue. So @CAPS3 are you going to do about it?"	5
777	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"  Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. On the other hand, other universities require students to specialize in one subject. In my opinion, I agree with the first case based on two reasons. First, there are many restricts to produce new creative things with only one subject these days. Second, even in the university, there should be chances for student to search for their real dreams. First of all, a person who have specialized in one specific subject is likely to be lack of a wide competence. I am currently double majoring in Computer science and Industrial design. Many courses of the department of the Industrial design for the students in more than third year requires the ability to make a computer program, being able to embedded in the product. In other words, there are lots of assignment or projects requiring not only designing the products that looks beautiful but also giving special functions to them. For example, some students majoring in Industrial design produces a color-changing lamp that recognizes the color of marbles which the user put into the lamp or a music player that plays love songs when the user draw a heart shape or songs related with rain when the user draw a rain drop shape on the player. Many students in the department of industrial design now choose Computer science of Electrical Engineering as their double major or minor, since it allows them to show more powerful performances with various knowledge. Furthermore, since students are still learners, not workers yet, they have to experience different fields that they have not done before. In Korea, students should choose their future job to go to an university usually when they just became a high school student. They have to focus on only one field and look for the very subject so that there are something they can show to the universities. One of my friends in KAIST is now majoring in Electrical engineering although his wanted-subject was Machine engineering when he was a freshman, and another friend, also in KAIST, is now majoring in Industrial design even though her first wanted-subject was Biological science. As anybody can see, since it is too early to choose only one subject that they have to specialize forever for 17-year-old high school students or 20-year-old freshmen, universities have to give more opportunity for students to search for many other subjects. In conclusion, I strongly agree with the statement that universities requiring students to take class in many subject is better than other universities requiring students to specialize in one subject. Firstly, students can achieve wide view throughout various subjects, which can be applied to their future works usefully. Moreover, since most of students who are only 20 or 21 years old are too young to find the thing that they really want to be, universities have to be the places for students to spread their wings by letting them experience more subjects than they expected. Also for me, taking classes in many subjects in KAIST have been a pretty helpful experience."	5

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear readers, On the current debate of the effects of computers, I believe they strongly benefit all people. For example on some computers a business software can be incorporated, allowing a meeting to be help over the computers. Not only is it convienent, but this saves money. Also, computers come with built in programs that can help keep track of you expenses. These are simple and save lots of time. Plus, computers also help you stay in touch with friends. Even if they are @NUM1 miles away you can click a button and have a live video chat! First off, the business software on new computers are out of this world. You can make a brochure of sales and expenses, all with an easy stroke on the mouse. This is a cheaper and greener way of presenting ideas. Furthermore, on the computer you and all you clients can hold a conference call. Doing this allows you to relax and multitask while your computer is feeding you coverage of the call in crystal-clear sound. Normally a phone would have to be glued to you ear but now you hands free. Another time where computers are handy is at tax time. Tired of running around your house to find you car bill from three months ago? Well, with a spreadsheet software like @ORGANIZATION1, taxes can be calculated in along with their name, so when you take the taxes to tax consultant, everything is organized. Using these tools cut down an stress and leaves you less frustrated. And even better, you can buy a tax program for you computer, so you never have to leave your couch! Think about, paying somebody to count your taxes year after year, when you can save a fortune and do it yourself. Above all, computers help you connect with old friends who have moved away or parted ways earlier in life. Now, the internet contains many social networking sites, such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 where you can reunite with lost pals. These networks also offering access to photosharing and chat, so everybody can see how your family is and vice versa. Along with this is video chatting, where you can have face to face conversation with somebody even on the other side of the world. This is totally private, so it isn't dangerous to say names of family members or their locations. The internet truly is an amazing tool! To conclude, the internet holds a very strong role in our daily lives. Not only can we see who man the @ORGANIZATION2 game, but it also has interactive business softwares as well. Never again will work be so difficult. Also, the computer has programs to help you manage expenses, keeping you on top of your game. Finally, it is also helpful for all the tools that can be used to interact with friends thousands of miles away. I believe the computer is critical for success and happiness in life. It's a new age, let's adapt to it."	5
779	Do you think that smartphones have destroyed communication among family and friends? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 	"I think smartphones haven't destroyed communication among family and friends for following three reasons. First,  smartphones have enhanced a new type of communication among people, such as messenger apps and social network services. Instead of talking to each other, many people choose to communicate with other people through SNS. The second reason is that some people still communicate in traditional ways. For instance, even though I use smartphones, I still talk to my friends every day. Finally, smartphones help people to share their thoughts effectively. You can simply utilize various types of media via smartphones, such as images and videos. Therefore, you can effectively communicate with other people. To sum up, smartphones haven't destroyed communication, but changed it in many ways."	5
780	Lifestyle: Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. Which do you agree with? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.	"Nowadays, as the world is developing rapidly, everyone is competing each other. They have their dreams to be successful in life, so they try to find the methods which can lead them to success. Although some people prefer taking risks for the success, making a well-prepared plan is another interesting method which can bring people to reach thier goals. One can select their best choice from a plan that they make. To make a careful plan, they have to spend much time to consider the possible positive and negative impacts of their choices; therefore, one can predict what the consequence of their choice is. For example, one who is going to enter a university. One will select the university which best fits their preference. Therefore, a plan provides a guideline for people so that they can choose the best choice based on thier preference. One would say that people should take risks first. If they fail, they still come back and be stronger. This statement might be true. Nevertheless, a well-prepared plan can make sure that  people can solve the mistakes quickly and easily. Someone may spend more than a year to come back from the mistakes they made;  however, with a plan, one can make an alternative choice because they already forecast the possible consequences. For example, if they are rejected by the university, they know which university they want to apply as the second choice. To sum up, people can encounter any problem or obstacle and solve them easily with the plan they made. In conclusion, people can make the best choice and encounter the possible mistakes if they make a careful plan. Life is not easy. That is why we have to spend more time thinking about life and what we want to do for success."	5

"From the point of view of a student, books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves just because of the material it contains. I read, watch, and listen to things everyday that my parents my not be too thrilled about, but it hasn't changed the person I am today. You can't escape things like drugs, sex, and other explicit things that we might not want our children reading about. It's in society. These things are everywhere, and just taking these materials off the shelves are not going to solve the problem. I think that we have a freedom to read about, listen, or watch whatever we would like, and removing these things takes away our freedom. I think that inappropriate books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should not be taken off the shelves. '@CAPS1' items are all over society. It's everywhere you look. Billboards, signs, books, magazine, music, television, movies, etc., but taking things like books, movies, music, and magazines off the shelves are not going to stop the inappropriate behavoir. Everyone in society is still going to act this way, whether you can stop your children from hearing about it or not. You still have commercials, billboards, etc. What are you going to do? Ban your children from life in general? No, I don't think so. Reading, listening, learning, about this stuff isn't going to make your child a horrible person. I personally think, at a certain age, they need to know about this stuff. For example, I'm a good student, I behave well outside of school, I have good friends, and I get along with my family. I also read every single one of @PERSON1 books. All of them are about people who do drugs, are suicidal, and do sexual related things. These books are extremely good. Definitely the best books I've ever read, but reading these books hasn't changed who I am. I don't do drugs, I'm not into sexual things, so why would it hurt if I read books about it? From my experience, reading these things are honestly kind of helpful. It takes you deeper into things. Everyone knows the basic learning you get in school, which is extremely @CAPS2. Reading these books, and listening to this kind of music, and watching these kinds of movies, takes a whole different point of view. Back to my experience with the @PERSON1 books, you read stories that are based off of her life and relationship with her daughter. Crank, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 is a trilogy of books that show the life of @LOCATION1. You see the struggle, the hurt, and the pain the family goes through as @PERSON2 starts to walk with the monster, also known as @CAPS5. Reading these books makes me realize that I don't want to ever put myself through the things @PERSON2 does to herself, and her family. It gives a whole new look on things. After reading these, I believe I won't ever do 'offensive' things. From my experiences as a student, I don't believe taking offensive material off the shelves is necessary. It gives a deeper look into information about these things. Also, you can't escape explicit material. These things are a part of life, something you can't run and hide from. You just have to accept the fact that it's there, and it's not going away. If you think your children are going to start doing those kinds of things after reading them, talk to them about it. You can't protect your children from offensive material. At least not forever"	5

"I believe that computers have a strong negative effect on society but a stronger positive one. Computers these days are very advanced and allow you to talk to your friends, allow you to acess information more efficiently, and have increased our man power in scientific research. Almost every teen has a screen name that allows you to chat online with your friends. This function keeps kids in touch and active. Eventhough instant messaging can distract kids from their daily life it can also be amazingly helpful. Just last week a friend of mine had forgotten to write down their homework and easly contacted online. I was able to let them know @NUM1 a matter of seconds. Like wise, with this online communication you can also talk and and video chat as if you right there with your friends not everyday do you get to go hang out with your friends so this is an easy alternative. Not only is quick and easy it's free. Computers keep kids off their phones and from jucking up the bill and causing those loud annoying phone bill conversations how to limit your texting. The most important effect computers have on society is the gathering of information. The internet allows people to acess millions of websites and light speed. Every second of the day their is someone on the internet searching for date that they would have to go to the library to get. Computers are a key part in society and we depend on them without them we would all be lost. They provide an easier way to life that us lazy @CAPS1 need to survive. The internet keeps us updated and informed on whats going on all around the world without even going there. We need the internet and we couldn't acess it without computers. One of the largest aspects of life computers have helped us with is research. Computers have multiplied our man power giving us more organized way to store date. Recently I was watching a show where they had a computer testing items for @CAPS2 a process that would take a human weeks. They also help us be different and more creative people. With the computer came smaller more compact computers till they were able to fit in the palm of our hand. They have lead us to think we can do greater things in life and keep our earth safe and to stop damaging it as much. They're lead us to research the unknown areas of the world where @NUM2 years ago a scientist with a pad of paper didn't have dare to even think about. Computers have linked the world through communication and information and have exelled us to greater heights in understanding how we came to be. Overall society needs computers and they have and overwhelming positive affect on society."	5
783	It is important for college students to have a part-time job.	"I find it hard to make a generalisation on whether it's important or not for college students to have a part-time job, because this seems like something very individual and highly dependent on the individual student and their circumstances. Jobs serve a few main functions: to earn money, to gain experience, to get a head-start in a career, and to have something to do. Whether or not it's important for a given college student to have a part-time job would thus be dependent on how important those various factors are for them. A poor student, for instance, would find a (paying) job beneficial or even necessary to meet their financial needs, and would find such a job to be more important for them than it would be for a rich student who does not have to worry about finances. Alternatively, a student might take up a job to gain experience and expand their horizons beyond the merely academic, and consider this an important pursuit. Another student might, however, find the time spent on a job to be better spent on their college work, studying and getting the best grades they can, so as to be able to (ideally) get a better job in future. Yet another student might wish to enjoy their last few years of freedom before entering the workforce, and find it more important to have free time to spend on leisure, rather than on a job. A final hypothetical student might meanwhile be already struggling with their college work (with or without additional commitments), and getting a job would further jeopardise their ability to cope. As such, while having a part-time job would be important for some college students, this assertion cannot be universally applied to all of them."	5

For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."	"I rested my back on the cool steel of the lockers trying to ease my nerves. ""@CAPS1 game is everything we have worked for- every excruciating practice, every tedious drill, and every game film we have studied down to the minutia. It was all to prepare us for tonight. @CAPS7 we lose tonight, everything we have worked was for nothing."" I listened attentively as @PERSON1, our team captain, spoke. The words she chose for our pre-game speech were straight to the point, and anything but sugar coated. As I glanced around the locker room it was easy to observe that everyone one of my teammates was anxious. Emilie was vigorously chewing what was left of her nails, while @LOCATION1 preferred to show her uneasiness by the constant tapping of her foot. @PERSON1 finished her speech, and with the break of our huddle we entered the gymnasium. The stands were packed with familiar faces of our small town. In a small section of the stands there was a group of people wearing colors not native to our school. @CAPS1 brutal reminder brought my attention back to warm ups. The twenty minutes we had for warm ups seemed to last no longer than two minutes. The announcer began to state our starting line up, but it was no use. The roar of the crowd overpowered the speaker system. It seemed as @CAPS7 everyone from our town of five thousand was attending the game. Not an empty space was left in the bleachers. The bench vibrated from the stomping and clapping of the crowd, threatening with every shake to collapse. The starting five for each team walked out to the center of the court for tip off. With the loss of the tip off our team was quickly put under pressure. From the first possession of the game we were chasing our opponent. The first two quarters ended with a dead even score. Feeling discouraged my team regrouped in the locker room for @DATE2 time. We entered the locker room a moment before my @CAPS3. I took @CAPS1 opportunity to @CAPS2 around at the expressions' of my teammates. Nothing, but disappointment and fear crossed their face's. My @CAPS3 opened the door, and I instinctively braced myself for the throwing of keys against the wall, or the smash of the clip board. My team had witnessed these acts of rage countless times before. To my surprise, my @CAPS3 entered with complete poise and composure, as @CAPS7 our first @DATE2 of treacherous play didn't phase him. We were not yelled at, or criticized. Instead, he rubbed his eyes, face down and shoulders hunched over. His belly began to shake, shortly followed by his shoulders. My first hypothesis was that he was crying, but then to my amazement, I heard the soft chuckle of our @CAPS3. Soon that soft chuckle metamorphosised into a stomach thrusting, loud cackle. My team exchanged confused glances, and waited for my @CAPS3's explanation in anticipation. ""@CAPS2 at yourself!"" @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ordered. ""@CAPS5 are all more tentative than when I asked @PERSON2 out to my first dance!"" We could always rely on @CAPS3 for an unrelated metaphor. Even @CAPS7 it wasn't related to basketball, the point was clear. ""@CAPS7 @CAPS5 guys would just believe in yourself the way I believe in @CAPS5, @CAPS1 game would be a blow out! Instead, @CAPS5 are playing like a bunch of bunny foo-foos!"" We all laughed with the thought of playing like the nursery rhyme we had hear so frequently when we were children. The speech @CAPS3 @CAPS4 gave eased us all. The confident team we should have been from the start of the match was now prepared to win the @DATE2. To think that @CAPS1 confidence came from just one comforting laugh seemed almost improbable. The whistle blew to start the @DATE2. We played with such assertiveness and confidence that @CAPS7 @CAPS5 were to compare one @DATE2 with the other, it would @CAPS2 like two different teams. We grasped the lead early in the @DATE1, and sustained it for the rest of the game. The victory of that night's game lead us one round deeper into the state tournament. As I walked back to the locker room I glanced around the massive gym. I looked at: the crowd, score board, opponents, referees and news reporters. I realized how easy it is to get caught up everything that shouldn't effect @CAPS5. All the distractions easily make @CAPS5 forget the main purpose of why @CAPS5 play the game. Occasionally we need reminders, like the calming laugh of @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Without that reassuring laugh, my team never would have united, and defeated our opponent."	5

"I believe that computers make everyday work easier to do. Computers allow someone from a faraway place to talk to another person who they can’t see in person, they allow you to get work done in a quicker manner. And get a college education without leaving your home. Imagine that you have a relative who lives a great deal of miles away from you and it’s too expensive to call or fly over there. Computers enable us to communicate with them through email or video chat without the hefty price. Because of computers, talking to your faraway family is a few clicks away. Getting work done can sometimes feel like another chore. Computers only make doing your work easier and faster. Would you rather sit and write out a term paper for hours or type it up and email to your in half the amount time college students find that computers get them efficiently than writing by hand. Computers are way to burdens of work. Education is an of all need, but what if the college that you want to attend is too far from home and you can’t afford to move in ? Thankfully, online college courses are available. If it wasn’t for this source of technology, you would be left to do what? Online courses allow an eager student to learn without breaking their bank or leaving their child if they are parents. Without computers, everyone would not be able to get the education that they have a right to. Computers have allowed us to communicate with our family that live somewhere we can’t afford to travel to. These technological devices have enabled to us to get our work done in a timely matter to receive the grade that we deserve. Computers have allowed over @NUM1 citizens to get their education right in their home at a price they can afford.

Read on and I am sure you will agree. First of all, computers are becoming a problem in society because they interfear with our physical well being. The @LOCATION1 is continuingly growing. Not in our population but the size of our people! According to a recent survey @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people in the @LOCATION1 are overweight or obease. ""The main culprit of the @ORGANIZATION2's percent of obeasity is not over eating it is actually electronics! Especially things like computers."" said @PERSON1 a surgean at @ORGANIZATION1, after dealing with a severe case of obesity. Obesity is not a hard thing to get rid of. All we have to do is instead of sitting for hours staring at a screen. America needs to get outside! It can be as simple as riding a bike or taking your dog for a walk. Whatever you do just get off your computer and go outside or the gym for exercise! Secondly, computers interfere with family and friends. I know from personal experience that parents hate it when their kids will miss family dinner or won't go out with their friends because they ""need"" to finish the next level on their game or they ""need"" to look something up on the internet. Family and friends should be a very important thing in your life but unfortunatly, for most people it is not. Psycologist, @PERSON2 has discovered that overall, having family and friends that you can count on beside you will make you a much happier more enjoyable person."" @CAPS1 eliminating computers from our lives we will create a happy and more pleasent society for the people of the @LOCATION1. Doing everyone a favor. Furthermore, if we cut back on our hours on the computer we will have a better chance to expeirence the wonder's mother nature has to offer us. Most people don't realize how much they are missing @CAPS1 not going outside. There are amazing things, right in your own backyard, that you will probably never get to expeirience because you are too addicted to playing on the computer. @NUM3 years ago people were able to function fine with out computers so we should be able to too. @PERCENT1 of people have never even been camping! So next time you feel like spending another @NUM4 hours on the computer, take a walk and I'm sure you will be amazed at what you find outdoors. In conclusion, computers do not benefit society. They just keep people away from going outside, enjoying nature and spending time with family and friends. I hope I have convinced you to see my side of the argument and thank you for your time."	5
787	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends."	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that computers do benefit society in a positive way. Without computers we would not be able to be as social. We also would not have the ability to do reseach for school online and running a business would be even more difficult. Without computers our society would not be so far advanced. Being social is an important quality in life. the main way of being social these days, other than texting, is to chat online with friends. Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and skype all give their users the ability to make new friends, find long lost friends, and chat with friends. I personally have a skype and facabook, and I am able to access them everyday. Without them, I wouldn't be able to chat with friends out of school except for sports and texting. Everyday I workout and lift weights and go on facebook, that is why that whole statement, ""spending less time exercising, and more time on the computer"" is false. Facebook and skype are a past of my everyday life and without them I know I would not be as social. Computers are also a part of my everyday life, because I have to use it to do research for school or typing up an @CAPS5 paper. As you have now seen, my handwriting is not so great, so I end up typing a lot of my homework because of it. Without computers my teachers would not be able to read my work. Computers also help with making graphs and data tables for science lab reports. Without a computer the graphs would have to be handmade, which is not as presentable. Overall computers are used everyday in school to either do research or to type up some homework. Education plays a key role in society and if we did not use computers out education that we would receive would not be the same as it is now. My last reason why i believe that computers play a positive role in society is that computers are what keeps businesses running. Without computers some businesses would be unable to function, and those could function, would be awful slow. Since our society is so far advanced our businesses need computers in order to complete the jobs. Expenses and income are saved to businesses computers, if that was all done an paper they could be lost or ruined. Computers also simplify work for businesses, they speed up the tasks that would takes a long time to be hand done and they complete the tasks that could not be acheived without a computer. Computers play a large part in the @CAPS6 of the world."	5

"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I will be talking about the wonderful impact computer technology has had on man kind. So many great discoveries and great topics have been found on the compture, studees have shown <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of famous in the united states has at least one computer in there house holds. There a great way look up important information withoout going to the and searching for hours, to contract others, and lets face it they make our a life a whole lot easier. Imagine this! your stressed and on edge you have just @NUM2 hours searching for a topic on your upcoming history essay. You have a pounding head ache and just want to quit, your probably in the libary reading through hundreds of books. Now imagine you being at home sprawled across your lap, all it takes is a few taps on your keyboard and bam! Instant information. Now how easy was that, thats one of the great impacts computer have made on us, humanity. Computers are terrific to learn things with a fast pase to it. I personally have used computers to @CAPS2 advantage you logon go to google type the subject of knowledge and its just like you have a personal teacher in your own home. A local study has been underway the have a groups, @CAPS6 A which has a libary full of books and @CAPS6 @CAPS3 a @CAPS6 with a @CAPS4 @CAPS5, The scientist gave them all the same essays, @CAPS6 @CAPS3 <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of student have passed with flying colars while @CAPS6 A <@PERCENT1@NUM4> passed with a @CAPS9 or higher. Thats important because higher grades, means higher test scores. higher test scores equal fundimg. I think computers are the best invention and is not imparing humans its evolving them. Imagine this! your sitting at home crying because your special other has moved far away from you well computers are a great way to reconect with that person. Computers have software were you can instant message, send emails, or even video chat with that person. For even some business man its an way to have meetings without flying @NUM5 miles. I have @NUM2 aunts that I cannot live without who are @CAPS2 strong base who I cant live without talking to for a day. Without computers I dont know what I would do. Scientist tool surveys that @PERCENT1 to the @CAPS10.S.A has family in other states, countries, or even contents, hey have to have some way to be in contact. @CAPS2 last reason is I know we have to admit it computers have made me and your life easier. Some jobs that have opened up giving unwadged citizens a sorce of income on computers. <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of jobs relay on computers. Imagine a chasier counting all the money, a banker having to take time counting one by one other peoples cash, a telemarketer calling with no way of information. All these ways and more that computers have impacted us. Now lets see how has computers not needed our learning ability, contracting others, and last but NOT least made me and yours life better. Computers are a terrific way for human to adap to the fast life."	5
789	"If you could change one important thing about your university, what would you change? Give specific reasons and details to support your opinion."	"  I love my university, KAIST. I believe that KAIST is the best university in Korea. KAIST is almost perfect, but it has only one thing that makes me sad. That is the location of my university. I sometimes feel sad because of it. Therefore, if I could change only one thing about KAIST, I want to change the location of my university. Moreover, I want to move KAIST to Seoul or near to Seoul. I have three reasons for my opinion. First of all, my university is so far from my house. I live in Suwon, in Kyung-gi do, so if I want to go KAIST, it takes much time and money. Even if my parents drive their car for me, it takes about 2 hours, so it is very hard work. Of course, there are other ways to go to KAIST that take KTX or SRT. If I ride them, time will be saved, but they are pretty expensive. Secondly, most of my friends are in Seoul or near Kyung-gi do. I went to my high school in Sejong, but there are many friends who live in Seoul. I graduated my high school now, but I usually miss them. However, I am in Daejeon, so it is too hard to meet my friends in Seoul. Although my friends sometimes come to Daejeon to meet me, I want to see them more. Lastly, there are many convenient systems in Seoul. First, I can go anywhere in Seoul so fast because of subways and buses. There are also very many places to enjoy. We can go Gang-nam, or other hot places in Seoul. Because of COVID-19, I can't play there with my friends, but after everything become better, Seoul will be the best place to meet my friends
  In conclusion, I want to change my university's geometrical location because KAIST is so far from my house and my friends, and there are many convenient systems in Seoul. Of course, there are not only disadvantages but also advantages because KAIST is in Daejeon. For example, Daejeon has very many scientific organizations, so we can focus on our research or studies. I know that it is impossible that move my university, so I just do my best in KAIST, in Daejeon."	5

"Computers and modern technology are advancing quickly, and more and more people are beginning to use them. Some people say that computers are a bad influence on @LOCATION1. I think other wise. I think computers are an amazing breakthrough in modern science. I believe computers are ideal for school work and comunicating with others, as long as they are used in moderation. Computers make school projects so simple I don't know if we could do without. Our social studies teacher @PERSON1 says that @PERCENT1 of his projects involve something on the computer. The internet is a great place to research for big papers and projects. With over thirty-million educational and informational websites, its easy to locate what you need quickly and easily. Once you have finished researching it is easy to type your report. If it isn't a written report, then there are many other programs for fancy presentations. Take microsoft @CAPS1 for example: you can make exotic background and texts, as well as unique animations to emphasize or to make it pop right off the page. Computers are also an ideal way to communicate with friends and family. Emailing is quick and easy to tell others what you want to say. If you want to chat, then you can use @CAPS2 or instant messaging. This allows you to type and sent emails faster. Both of these programs are an inivative way to talk with a family member that isn't home. Like lets say my dad goes on business to @LOCATION2. We can email back and forth every day. And now with @ORGANIZATION1 (a video chat) you can see the person and actually talk to them like they're back at home. Computers have their advantages but they also have disadvantages. Computers are great for communicating and school work, but when used in excess can be unhealthy. Here is one example: my older brother @PERSON2 is a senior in high school. He is in school from @NUM1 to @NUM2:pm and as he gets home he heads straight for his computer. He is on there for at least five hours a night and that leaves time for dinner and not much of anything else including sleep. I think that computers are a great invation in modern technology as long as people limit themselves. Computers are coming out with new features everyday and who know theyll be like..."	5
791	Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 	"People have different points of view about the diversity of subjects students take. For example, some universities require students to take classes in many subjects whereas there are some others that require students to specialize in one subject. Universities which prefer specialized students in one subject argue that focusing on one subject has the advantage of having better expertise. Although the idea of ""Deep and narrow is better than shallow and wide"" is true, I prefer students to take classes in many subjects for two reasons. First, all subjects are connected. Students cannot succeed just because they are good at math, and students cannot succeed just because they are good at physics. When it is time to utilize the subjects students have learned, they should eventually integrate them with other subjects. For example, suppose a student only learned mechanical engineering. This student has no knowledge other than mechanical engineering, and he wants to participate in robotics research, a branch of mechanical engineering. However, since robotics is also very closely linked to biology, this student will have a lot of difficulties in the research process. Second, students don't know which subject is suit for them. Most majors and subjects are determined when students graduate from high school and enter university. However, young students at this time are still inexperienced and don't know exactly what they will learn in college. Universities should provide these students with more opportunities to experience and set up a system to take various subjects. In conclusion, because of the connectivity of subjects and the instability of young students due to lack of experience, universities should encourage students to take various subjects. A number of students change the subjects they are learning and taking at university. Universities should reduce the time wasted unnecessarily by students' wrong choice of subjects."	5
792	"Censorship in the Libraries ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, AuthorWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your vies on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading."	"Many people in the @LOCATION1 read. Books, magazines, news papers, and music are a great passing time. I enjoy reading books about people with special powers; such as necromancers. If we were to take such books that offend someone out of our libraries, what would we have left? I, for one, don't like reading @ORGANIZATION1 books, which seem to be the only type of book that wouldn't offend someone, unless they have some severe hatred towards letters. Think for a moment about what you like. Think about your interest in music, art, and the style of books or magazines that you read. Now imagine all of those gone from the one place you can get away from screaming children or annoying neighbors: the library. You @MONTH1 be baffled as to why all of your loves have dissappeared. That book you love, the one about necromancers, it's offensive to @CAPS1 because only @CAPS2 has the power of waking the dead. The song that you have had stuck in your head all day is now no longer online. Its use of certain words are offensive to those with 'sensitive' ears. If I were to walk into a library and find that all the 'offensive' works had been band, I would be shocked. Every one in the universe finds certain things offensive. My @CAPS3 @CAPS4 teacher thinks that rap and hip-hop or pop songs are offensive to women and their bodies, but I think that some of those songs hold a different meaning. If everything offensive were to be taken away, what would be left? Nothing that a teenager or an adult would want to read. Heck, @PERSON1' works are offensive to some people, they think he was crazy, and who wants their children to read a book written by a bafoon? Also, the less the library contains, the less people go. Libraries would soon close because everything is being found as offensive. All of the books we had hoped to read would have to be bought online, if it were still allowed. For all of the Book @CAPS5 out there, finding an attention-getting, eye-opening book is like finding buried treasure. It's an event that changes your life, makes your blood rush, and leaves you hanging onto your seat. It's an adventure played in your head, one that you set the specific details of each character, or it's the book that provides the knowledge that feeds your brain every time a new sentence is stored. Taking away everything offensive is like having a child being taken away, you can't replace that love with a distraction"	5
