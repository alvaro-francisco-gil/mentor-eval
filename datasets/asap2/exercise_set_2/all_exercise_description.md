Making Mona Lisa Smile (Reconstructed)

Can a machine really tell if you’re happy or sad—just by looking at your face? Thanks to a new computer system, the answer might surprise you.

Using a powerful scientific tool called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), researchers have taught computers to "read" human emotions. By analyzing tiny movements in a person’s facial muscles, the system can identify six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

The technology works by tracking the specific ways our facial muscles move. For example, when someone is angry, the muscles around the mouth—like the orbicularis oris—tighten. When someone is happy, the corners of their mouth lift. Dr. Paul Ekman, one of the world’s leading researchers in this field, mapped out these expressions and proved that they are universal—shared by all people, regardless of culture or language. As Dr. Qiang Huang puts it, “The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression.”

Now, scientists are applying this technology in creative ways. In one project, researchers used FACS to analyze the expression of Leonardo da Vinci’s famous portrait, the Mona Lisa. The computer determined that she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. For the first time, people could “read” her emotions using data—not just guesswork.

This kind of analysis allows artists, historians, and scientists to study ancient portraits in new ways. And thanks to advances in 3D modeling, researchers can even simulate the way facial muscles move in real life, just like da Vinci did in his detailed studies of human anatomy. It turns out that his understanding of muscle structure helped him paint more lifelike emotions centuries before computers existed.

But FACS isn’t just for art. This same technology is being explored in education, therapy, advertising, and even public safety. For instance, in a classroom, computers might one day be able to help teachers recognize if students are confused, bored, or engaged—just by analyzing their facial expressions. It’s a powerful tool with exciting possibilities—but it also raises important questions about privacy and how such data should be used.

Still, the idea that a computer can now make Mona Lisa smile—or at least tell us how she was feeling—might just be the start of a new era in how we see emotions in others... and in ourselves.

## Question
In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Using details from the article, write an essay arguing whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

## Rubric
After reading each essay and completing the analytical rating form, assign a holistic score based on the rubric below. For the following evaluations you will need to use a grading scale between 1 (minimum) and 6 (maximum). As with the analytical rating form, the distance between each grade (e.g., 1-2, 3-4, 4-5) should be considered equal.

**SCORE OF 6:** An essay in this category demonstrates clear and consistent mastery, although it may have a few minor errors. A typical essay effectively and insightfully develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates outstanding critical thinking; the essay uses clearly appropriate examples, reasons, and other evidence taken from the source text(s) to support its position; the essay is well organized and clearly focused, demonstrating clear coherence and smooth progression of ideas; the essay exhibits skillful use of language, using a varied, accurate, and apt vocabulary and demonstrates meaningful variety in sentence structure; the essay is free of most errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics.

**SCORE OF 5:** An essay in this category demonstrates reasonably consistent mastery, although it will have occasional errors or lapses in quality. A typical essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates strong critical thinking; the essay generally using appropriate examples, reasons, and other evidence taken from the source text(s) to support its position; the essay is well organized and focused, demonstrating coherence and progression of ideas; the essay exhibits facility in the use of language, using appropriate vocabulary demonstrates variety in sentence structure; the essay is generally free of most errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics.

**SCORE OF 4:** An essay in this category demonstrates adequate mastery, although it will have lapses in quality. A typical essay develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates competent critical thinking; the essay using adequate examples, reasons, and other evidence taken from the source text(s) to support its position; the essay is generally organized and focused, demonstrating some coherence and progression of ideas exhibits adequate; the essay may demonstrate inconsistent facility in the use of language, using generally appropriate vocabulary demonstrates some variety in sentence structure; the essay may have some errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics.

**SCORE OF 3:** An essay in this category demonstrates developing mastery, and is marked by ONE OR MORE of the following weaknesses: develops a point of view on the issue, demonstrating some critical thinking, but may do so inconsistently or use inadequate examples, reasons, or other evidence taken from the source texts to support its position; the essay is limited in its organization or focus, or may demonstrate some lapses in coherence or progression of ideas displays; the essay may demonstrate facility in the use of language, but sometimes uses weak vocabulary or inappropriate word choice and/or lacks variety or demonstrates problems in sentence structure; the essay may contain an accumulation of errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics.

**SCORE OF 2:** An essay in this category demonstrates little mastery, and is flawed by ONE OR MORE of the following weaknesses: develops a point of view on the issue that is vague or seriously limited, and demonstrates weak critical thinking; the essay provides inappropriate or insufficient examples, reasons, or other evidence taken from the source text to support its position; the essay is poorly organized and/or focused, or demonstrates serious problems with coherence or progression of ideas; the essay displays very little facility in the use of language, using very limited vocabulary or incorrect word choice and/or demonstrates frequent problems in sentence structure; the essay contains errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics so serious that meaning is somewhat obscured.

**SCORE OF 1:** An essay in this category demonstrates very little or no mastery, and is severely flawed by ONE OR MORE of the following weaknesses: develops no viable point of view on the issue, or provides little or no evidence to support its position; the essay is disorganized or unfocused, resulting in a disjointed or incoherent essay; the essay displays fundamental errors in vocabulary and/or demonstrates severe flaws in sentence structure; the essay contains pervasive errors in grammar, usage, or mechanics that persistently interfere with meaning.
