**Making Mona Lisa Smile** (Reconstructed by GPT from student commentary and direct quotes)

Imagine a computer that can tell exactly how you’re feeling—just by reading your face. It might sound like science fiction, but thanks to a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), it’s now a reality.


This groundbreaking technology comes from the work of Professor Thomas Huang at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, in collaboration with Dr. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Their software allows computers to analyze and identify human emotions by tracking tiny facial movements. These experts are part of a field focused on building better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

The process starts when a computer builds a 3-D model of the human face. This model includes all 44 major facial muscles, each one moving like real human muscles. A movement of one or more muscles is called an “action unit.” These action units form the basis for emotional expression.

The system draws from the work of Dr. Paul Ekman, who identified six basic emotions:
happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.
Each of these emotions is associated with a unique combination of muscle movements. For instance, your frontalis pars lateralis raises your eyebrows when surprised, while your orbicularis oris tightens around the mouth when you’re angry.

These expressions are universal, notes Dr. Huang. Although people may show different intensities of emotion, the basic facial expressions appear across all cultures.

The researchers decided to put their system to the test by analyzing the most famously mysterious face in art—Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. What is she really feeling? According to the system’s analysis:
“She’s 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.”

This finding reveals that the Mona Lisa’s expression may contain mixed emotions, something previously difficult to define in a single image. The computer compares facial features to a “neutral face” to weigh different expressions and determine emotional states.

While the Mona Lisa analysis might bring a smile to your face, this technology has real-world applications, especially in classrooms. Dr. Huang predicts,
“A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.”

That means educational software could become adaptive, adjusting lessons based on students’ emotional feedback. It could also alert teachers when students feel frustrated, distracted, or disengaged—offering more chances for help.

In addition, this software might enhance video games, virtual surgeries, or even ads. For example,
“If you smile when a Web ad appears, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.”

The system can also help spot fake smiles or forced emotions. It turns out that a genuine smile involves muscles near the eyes, like the orbicularis oculi, which creates "crow’s feet." Fake smiles, on the other hand, often only activate the zygomatic major, stretching the mouth sideways without engaging the eyes.

These clues are sometimes used to spot when a celebrity or politician isn’t being truthful, highlighting the potential for lie detection and behavioral analysis.

Though some may worry about privacy or accuracy, this technology opens up powerful possibilities. As Dr. Huang notes:
“Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that too.”

## Question
In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Using details from the article, write an essay arguing whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

## Rubric
After reading each essay and completing the analytical rating form, assign a holistic score based on the rubric below. For the following evaluations you will need to use a grading scale between 1 (minimum) and 6 (maximum). As with the analytical rating form, the distance between each grade (e.g., 1-2, 3-4, 4-5) should be considered equal.

**SCORE OF 6:** An essay in this category demonstrates clear and consistent mastery, although it may have a few minor errors. A typical essay effectively and insightfully develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates outstanding critical thinking; the essay uses clearly appropriate examples, reasons, and other evidence taken from the source text(s) to support its position; the essay is well organized and clearly focused, demonstrating clear coherence and smooth progression of ideas; the essay exhibits skillful use of language, using a varied, accurate, and apt vocabulary and demonstrates meaningful variety in sentence structure; the essay is free of most errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics.

**SCORE OF 5:** An essay in this category demonstrates reasonably consistent mastery, although it will have occasional errors or lapses in quality. A typical essay effectively develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates strong critical thinking; the essay generally using appropriate examples, reasons, and other evidence taken from the source text(s) to support its position; the essay is well organized and focused, demonstrating coherence and progression of ideas; the essay exhibits facility in the use of language, using appropriate vocabulary demonstrates variety in sentence structure; the essay is generally free of most errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics.

**SCORE OF 4:** An essay in this category demonstrates adequate mastery, although it will have lapses in quality. A typical essay develops a point of view on the issue and demonstrates competent critical thinking; the essay using adequate examples, reasons, and other evidence taken from the source text(s) to support its position; the essay is generally organized and focused, demonstrating some coherence and progression of ideas exhibits adequate; the essay may demonstrate inconsistent facility in the use of language, using generally appropriate vocabulary demonstrates some variety in sentence structure; the essay may have some errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics.

**SCORE OF 3:** An essay in this category demonstrates developing mastery, and is marked by ONE OR MORE of the following weaknesses: develops a point of view on the issue, demonstrating some critical thinking, but may do so inconsistently or use inadequate examples, reasons, or other evidence taken from the source texts to support its position; the essay is limited in its organization or focus, or may demonstrate some lapses in coherence or progression of ideas displays; the essay may demonstrate facility in the use of language, but sometimes uses weak vocabulary or inappropriate word choice and/or lacks variety or demonstrates problems in sentence structure; the essay may contain an accumulation of errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics.

**SCORE OF 2:** An essay in this category demonstrates little mastery, and is flawed by ONE OR MORE of the following weaknesses: develops a point of view on the issue that is vague or seriously limited, and demonstrates weak critical thinking; the essay provides inappropriate or insufficient examples, reasons, or other evidence taken from the source text to support its position; the essay is poorly organized and/or focused, or demonstrates serious problems with coherence or progression of ideas; the essay displays very little facility in the use of language, using very limited vocabulary or incorrect word choice and/or demonstrates frequent problems in sentence structure; the essay contains errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics so serious that meaning is somewhat obscured.

**SCORE OF 1:** An essay in this category demonstrates very little or no mastery, and is severely flawed by ONE OR MORE of the following weaknesses: develops no viable point of view on the issue, or provides little or no evidence to support its position; the essay is disorganized or unfocused, resulting in a disjointed or incoherent essay; the essay displays fundamental errors in vocabulary and/or demonstrates severe flaws in sentence structure; the essay contains pervasive errors in grammar, usage, or mechanics that persistently interfere with meaning.
